      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;So, all I have to do is drink that stuff?&amp;rdquo; Miu asked. For someone who had been super before, the question felt utterly strange to anybody else in the room.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Midnight was long-past but Miu didn&amp;rsquo;t feel tired at all. Her body was still filled to the brim with super energy and the dancing she had done so far may have been beyond the capabilities of humans, but not enough to actually put a hole into her energy supply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are you sure you want to do this?&amp;rdquo; Michelle asked once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James rolled his eyes. &amp;ldquo;You know that I gave it some thought, after all you read them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Michelle bit her lip as she used her X-ray vision to keep track of the situation. After a fight with James she had visited her sister for some counseling about that - only to be disturbed by her sister&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deziree turned around to spot a woman hovering there. She wore a black catsuit with red and orange flames on it that seemed to flow straight into the boots she wore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You have got to be kidding me!&amp;rdquo; Prof. Christopher Harland didn&amp;rsquo;t even try to hide his disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dr. Thompson, do you have a minute?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James turned around to face the woman who had addressed him. He already recognized her voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;James Thompson awoke from one of the strangest dreams he ever had and was immediately faced with the most likely reason for this. Michelle was still sound asleep, her lips curled to a smile that begged to be kissed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fred stared at the open window of his hospital room as if he expected her. Amanda had silently watched his conversation with Erika, using her newfound super hearing to eavesdrop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Erika finished her drink while she calmly looked around the bar. Since it was Monday there weren&amp;rsquo;t many people there, making it harder for her to find a man to… relieve some stress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;James got home and checked his calendar. Yes, today was Sunday. He didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like he had just spent a day off, which was a stark contrast to how his work had been before this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The blonde woman hovered above the city trying to find an opportunity to put her superpowers to good use. It had been just over ten minutes since she left the parking block.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“I can’t believe you actually took it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelle’s first reaction to seeing her best friend Amanda with  the body of a goddess hovering through her apartment window was  different than either of them had expected it to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“That was so awesome,” was the first thing Amanda said when  they arrived back at Michelle’s place. “How you jumped out of this  burning house, with this girl in your arms, descending to the ground  like an angel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amanda Steward was sure that she would never forget this day.  This morning, she had found out that her boyfriend had been cheating on  her for weeks; hours later, her best friend Michelle had shown her  something so unbelievable, the young woman could barely put it into  words. After drinking some strange liquid, Michelle’s plain body had  transformed into that of a super sexy goddess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The morning sun had been shining into the apartment room for hours before its sole inhabitant finally decided to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was already dark, when Michelle Jenkins returned to her apartment. She was exhausted, the last weeks had taken a toll on her and she was really glad that the weekend had finally arrived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
