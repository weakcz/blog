I\u0026rsquo;m trying to watch the TV!\u0026rdquo;\nDon Agbayani sat up straight, mustered his meanest scowl, and turned around in his chair to face the two offenders. On his jobsites, he\u0026rsquo;d cultivated quite a reputation for ruthlessness. But the sight of his daughter and her little friend Mia rolling around and giggling hysterically on the living room floor was just too cute. How could he get angry at a pair of 10-year-old girls for having too much fun?\n\u0026ldquo;Aww Da-aaaad!\u0026rdquo; Little Serena rolled her eyes at her father, still giggling as she positioned herself between Mia and the rubber ball they were chasing. Mia tugged but could not make her way around.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you two have some homework to do? Or some chores?\u0026rdquo;\nBut the girls had already turned away laughing, pushing one another, and alternately screaming \u0026ldquo;give it!\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;stop it!\u0026rdquo; at the top of their lungs. Don turned to his wife Angela and rolled his eyes. Angela returned his smile with a knowing nod and a pat on the knee. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s only going to keep getting bigger \u0026amp; more independent you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t remind me.\u0026rdquo; Don sighed.\n\u0026ldquo;Aww\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Angela\u0026rsquo;s sentence trailed off as the two parents glanced back over their shoulders at their daughter and her friend. They had since moved into the hallway, still tumbling hand over foot on top of one another and making way too much noise. It was already past 10:00\u0026hellip; surely this was just a final burst of energy before bedtime. The two doting parents shrugged their shoulders, chuckling as they turned their attentions back to the TV.\nJust then, an announcer broke through mid-commercial, panting and trying to catch his breath. Sirens and helicopters could be heard in the background, and the air around him seemed thick with black smoke.\n\u0026ldquo;This is Alan Norwood with Channel 4 news. I\u0026rsquo;m reporting live from the tracks outside Brisbane, where a passenger train has derailed at high speed. The number of injured is unknown, but rescue crews have already began pulling people from the wreckage. \u0026quot;\nThe children, overhearing the broadcast, dropped what they were doing and ran right up to the screen. Angela gasped and clutched fearfully at her husband\u0026rsquo;s thigh. \u0026ldquo;Oh no\u0026hellip; there are still people trapped in there!\u0026rdquo;\nThe camera panned out, providing a full view of the disaster as it unfolded. \u0026ldquo;It appears that almost everyone from the front of the train has been evacuated, but a raging fire has cut the final three cars off from rescuers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; gasped Serena as the camera zoomed back in on the terrified face of a woman trapped by the blaze. The sight was horrific. Her father got up from his couch, walking briskly over to the two young girls to take them from the room (\u0026ldquo;this is far too graphic for little kids\u0026rdquo; he thought). As he bent over to put his arms around their waists, however, his attention was recaptured by the newsman on screen.\n\u0026ldquo;Firefighters are working as diligently as possible, but apparently a water flow problem is rendering their hoses useless\u0026hellip; and as long as the blaze is still raging, there is no way to get rescue workers inside. The San Francisco Fire Marshal has just arrived, and channel 4 is preparing\u0026hellip; to\u0026hellip; uh\u0026hellip; wait a minute\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe announcer\u0026rsquo;s face went from stern to confused as his gaze wandered from the camera lens. His train of thought clearly derailed as his eyes were drawn slowly upward, seeming to track something moving along the horizon. \u0026ldquo;What the\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nA few more moments of stuttering and pointing passed before the camera finally swung around to look. The lens immediately captured a small purplish dot growing ever larger \u0026ndash; some kind of projectile heading straight towards them. Slowly. Slowly. A few more moments and it became clear that the dot was actually a figure \u0026ndash; a human figure \u0026ndash; hurdling through the sky!\nSerena and Mia dropped to their knees, wriggling from her father\u0026rsquo;s grasp and inching even closer to the screen. \u0026ldquo;Oh my God,\u0026rdquo; shrieked Mia\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;That’s a PERSON!\u0026rdquo;\nThe reporter continued to stammer unintelligibly into his microphone as the figure grew ever larger onscreen. Racing from its spot on the horizon, the cameraman shook and strained to stay locked on his target. He lost it in the clouds for a second, spun around frantically trying to relocate it, and finally settled back on the mystery figure hovering about fifty feet directly above the wreckage. A quick twist of the zoom brought the image into focus - causing Serena and Mia to gasp and exclaim at once: \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s a GIRL!\u0026rdquo;\nThe two youngsters stared at the picture on the TV. The announcer started talking again, but by this point his voice was nothing more than background noise. No one watching would be able to concentrate on anything outside of that breathtaking visual. There, before their very eyes, was an actual flying person!\nThe camera came to a standstill and focused in on the figure hovering weightlessly above the flaming wreckage. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been any older than 20 or 21 years old - but to Serena, she was simply the most perfect, beautiful, graceful, and elegant grown-up she\u0026rsquo;d ever seen. The camera zoomed in and Serena gasped at the woman\u0026rsquo;s gorgeous, exotic features. Big, blue eyes. A small, upturned nose. Full lips. Her body was swathed in a skintight shimmering purple, blue, and gold bodysuit, and boasted some of the most impressive curves she had ever seen. Powerfully athletic and trim, yet shapely and impossibly curvaceous at the same time. Her long golden blonde hair danced in the wind around her angelic face. She hovered there in the breeze with her hands on her hips looking stern, allowing Serena, Mia, and the rest of the TV viewing audience to drink in the sight of her - before she spun around and launched herself into action.\nThe camera struggled to follow, but the mysterious figure\u0026rsquo;s path was just too quick and erratic. She quickly dropped to ground level, zipping around the train faster than the eye could see. In a blur of purple and gold, a pile of flaming debris seemed to rise from thin air in a clearing about 100 feet downwind of the accident scene. Another few moments and the engine fire had been fully extinguished. And then, car by car, the flames slowly died down. No one could tell exactly how it was happening, but in just a few moments, the raging inferno had been reduced to little more than a few disconnected piles of smoke and ash.\nMost of the passengers had already been evacuated, but the remaining few began to file out from the tail cars. Some coughing and some crying, but all seemingly unharmed. Everyone was looking around, trying to find their mysterious rescuer, but she was nowhere to be seen. \u0026ldquo;Up there!\u0026rdquo; yelled a little boy, his finger pointed skyward. The crowd and camera turned just in time to catch a purple and gold streak disappearing over the horizon.\nBack in her living room, Serena turned in a stunned silence to face her best friend. What they had just witnessed defied all logic and explanation. The bottom seemed to drop out from her stomach. She just couldn\u0026rsquo;t put the strange feeling into words. All she knew was that somehow, something deep inside of her had been set free.\n :::..::: SAN FRANCISCO - PRESENT DAY :: DAY I ::\n Serena took her keys out of her pocket and unfastened the double doors. She was really thankful that her landlords put a weight room in the apartment complex - she\u0026rsquo;d always been far too insecure to go work out at the gym. Even though she hated exercising, she knew she needed to do something about her figure - she was sick of watching all her skinny friends get dates while she sat alone at night watching videos.\nLocking the door behind her, she made her way in and turned on the lights. Throwing her gym bag down, she pulled her shoulder length hair back into a pony-tail, walked over to the back wall, and began her stretches. Catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror, Serena adjusted her glasses and paused to give her body a critical appraisal.\nStaring back from her reflection was a pretty, if slightly chubby 22 year old Asian American girl of Filipina \u0026amp; Chinese descent. She wore running shorts, a sports bra, and a zipped-up sweatshirt. Her pear-shaped body stood barely 5'3\u0026rdquo;, and looked bigger than the 125 lbs. it carried. She turned around and picked up the back of her sweatshirt in order to get a good look at her butt. No matter how much she ran, her thighs and ass always carried most of her weight and she absolutely hated it. She had hoped that a regular workout regimen would get her the body she wanted, but after six long and hard months of serious exercise, she had seen absolutely no changes. She stared at her behind disapprovingly for a minute before rolling her eyes and turning back around.\nAfter pausing to make sure no one else was in the area, Serena removed her sweatshirt and examined herself more intently. Bringing her hands up to her sports bra, she pushed her \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; cup breasts together, trying in vain to create the impression of cleavage. After a moment she dropped her hands with a sigh, wishing that the fat in her ass had instead gone to her breasts. She sighed to herself thinking what a knockout she\u0026rsquo;d be with a nice tight ass and some big tits.\n\u0026ldquo;Too bad - it just wasn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be,\u0026rdquo; she thought as she walked onto the treadmill to begin her run.\nA few minutes into her jog, Serena\u0026rsquo;s mind began to drift. She started thinking of Mia, her best friend since kindergarten. The two of them had always been a little bit overweight until Mia started lifting weights a few years back. Now she was well on the way of becoming an absolute knockout. Her body wasn’t perfect yet… but it was vastly improved from what it used to be. Serena remembered how Mia had tried to bring her along to those first workout sessions. At the time, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe her friend was bold enough to show her body to anyone anywhere. Serena remembered saying that there was \u0026ldquo;no way\u0026rdquo; she\u0026rsquo;d ever get dragged into going. Mia wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to let other people\u0026rsquo;s opinions stop her though (despite her poor self-image about her weight, she never was the type to really care what other people thought), and thanks to her hard work and a little late-blooming help from mother nature, she was finally breaking her way into the dating scene.\n\nGetting frustrated, Serena increased her pace. Thinking of Mia made her even more determined to shed pounds. She hated to admit that she secretly resented Mia\u0026rsquo;s accomplishments. Since they had been little girls, they always hung out together \u0026ndash; their insecurities about their bodies were something that they\u0026rsquo;d had in common for as long as she could remember. But now that Mia was crossing over to the side of the \u0026ldquo;beautiful people,\u0026rdquo; Serena felt more alone than ever. She tried to stay objective - to not let physical things get in the way of her deepest friendship\u0026hellip; unfortunately, the recent changes in Mia\u0026rsquo;s body were starting to put a noticeable strain on their relationship.\nA bead of sweat fell from Serena\u0026rsquo;s forehead as she struggled to maintain her pace. She was 10 minutes into her run and was already getting quite winded. Concentrating on her reflection on the far wall, she mentally imposed Mia\u0026rsquo;s body over her own. Drifting off, she imagined her friend\u0026rsquo;s beautiful thighs were attached to her body\u0026hellip; that her chubby waist and hips were becoming sleek and muscular like Mia\u0026rsquo;s. She smiled at that mental image, finding the strength to push through the last ten minutes of her run.\nTurning off the treadmill, Serena stepped over to the Nautilus machine. Toweling the sweat from her forehead, she sat down and reached to reset the bench-press pin. However, just as she was about to lie back on the bench, she heard a noise in the hallway - there was someone coming! Serena jumped off the bench, grabbed her bag, and darted nervously into the bathroom. The last thing she wanted was for another tenant to see her in a sports bra and a pair of spandex workout shorts! Bundling all of her stuff up, she ran to the toilet and locked the door behind her just as the footsteps reached the gym entrance. Slowly, the weight room door was unlocked and pushed open, and Serena peered through the crack in the door to see who it was.\n\u0026ldquo;Shit, it\u0026rsquo;s Jennifer Benson,\u0026rdquo; Serena said to herself, \u0026ldquo;she\u0026rsquo;s probably going to be in here working out for hours and I\u0026rsquo;m stuck in the frigging bathroom.\u0026rdquo; She rolled her eyes at the predicament, angry at herself for letting her embarrassment get the best of her again. Now what was she going to do? She couldn\u0026rsquo;t just walk out there\u0026hellip; Peering through the doorway, she noticed the blonde was acting a little nervous. \u0026ldquo;Hmm, I wonder what\u0026rsquo;s up with her,\u0026rdquo; she thought.\n... Jennifer Benson was a tall, model-thin, successful, super-attractive, all-American blonde. She must have been almost ten years older than Serena, but had such a youthful energy, it would be easy to think the two of them were the same age. Even though they had never exchanged more than passing words in the hallway, Serena had developed a distanced jealousy. The sleek blonde represented everything the dumpy Asian girl wished she could be.\nJennifer was dressed in a long overcoat, her hair was tied back, and she had her glasses on (as usual). Serena watched as she went back to the door and locked it behind her before turning back around to face the bathroom. \u0026ldquo;I wonder what she\u0026rsquo;s being so secretive about,\u0026rdquo; she thought, \u0026ldquo;that girl is acting awfully strange.\u0026rdquo;\nJust then, Jennifer reached up, took off her glasses, and untied her hair, shaking it free. Serena watched in envy as the long blond locks fell in waves across her shoulders. Thinking back, she tried but failed to remember if she had ever seen Jennifer without her glasses on. Jennifer removed a small opaque vial from her coat pocket and uncorked the lid. Looking around the room once again and sensing that she was alone; she shut her eyes, downed the contents, and clenched her teeth.\nWhat happened next was straight out of a science fiction movie, and Serena had to put both hands over her mouth to avoid yelping in amazement. Through the crack in the bathroom door, Serena watched as the other girl downed the contents of the vial in one swift motion. Quickly stuffing the empty bottle in the pocket of her overcoat, Jennifer hesitated for a second before doubling over in what appeared to be intense pain.\nJennifer dropped to one knee and crossed her arms in front of her chest. \u0026ldquo;What the fuck?\u0026rdquo; thought Serena, tempted to burst out of the door to see if she was okay\u0026hellip; when slowly, the blonde started to shake. Serena watched her hair start to grow longer and thicker and\u0026hellip; blonder? Eventually spilling all the way down her back until it reached her butt.\nSerena was so transfixed on Jennifer\u0026rsquo;s growing hair that she almost didn\u0026rsquo;t hear the sound of hundreds of tiny threads stretching at once. But before she understood what was happening, Jennifer stood back up and hurriedly tossed off her overcoat to reveal a form-fitting purple and blue spandex bodysuit with a big gold \u0026ldquo;H\u0026rdquo; on the chest and lightning bolts down the arms. A gold belt wrapped itself tightly around her waist, drawing Serena\u0026rsquo;s eyes down to the full cut purple bikini bottom - cut just high enough to let the bottom of her perky butt stick out from underneath. Knee-high blue boots and a floor-length purple \u0026amp; gold cape completed the ensemble. \u0026ldquo;Holy cow,\u0026rdquo; Serena thought \u0026ldquo;Jennifer Benson is Hyperwoman!\u0026rdquo;\nSerena watched Jennifer\u0026rsquo;s body continue to tighten. Her legs growing thicker and more defined - with tight balls of muscle appearing at her calves, and strong, meaty thighs developing on her previously scrawny legs. Her butt also began to swell from its previously flat shape - flexing and growing to create an almost 2 inch horizontal shelf between the bottom of her lower back and the top of her behind. Much of the fat on her waist and stomach slowly melted away, accentuating her hourglass shape, revealing her abdominal muscles through the purple spandex as they visibly pulled themselves tightly into a washboard six pack.\nJennifer squinted and again brought her wrists across her chest, straining to flex her arms and shoulders. Suddenly, Serena heard a \u0026ldquo;pop\u0026rdquo; as the tendons and muscles underneath Hyperwoman\u0026rsquo;s supple skin suddenly sprang to life. Her muscles popped out to reveal biceps, triceps, and deltoids that were cut finer than any fitness model or bodybuilder she had ever seen \u0026ndash; yet she still somehow exuded all the softness and femininity of a larger-than-life fashion model or movie star. A nervous thrill washed over Serena\u0026rsquo;s body\u0026hellip; this was insane! It was like watching a goddess come to life!\nExhaling, Hyperwoman took a second to toss her head from side to side, shaking out her hair and loosening her neck. Finally, she uncrossed her arms, cocked her shoulders, and placed her hands on her waist in the classic superheroine pose. She smiled as she glanced down at her own chest. Serena observed that the superheroine\u0026rsquo;s breasts were tight \u0026amp; perky - but hardly the huge \u0026ldquo;Hyper-Boobs\u0026rdquo; that were the subject of male fantasies across the globe. As if on cue, Jennifer Benson smiled wickedly and exclaimed \u0026ldquo;This looks like a job for Hyperwoman!\u0026rdquo; Taking a deep breath, she closed her eyes, and flexed what looked to be all of her muscles at once.\nSerena was transfixed as she watched the thin spandex of Jennifer\u0026rsquo;s costume begin to constrict. Her nipples slowly became visible underneath the fabric as they started pushing outward, her breasts beginning to fill with a heavy supernatural energy. In a few moments, her expanding chest forced itself against the pull of the tight fabric, creating a line of cleavage that pressed its way past the exposed neckline of her uniform. The spandex material continued its struggle, as through the crack in the door, Serena saw Jennifer\u0026rsquo;s breasts suddenly inflate - rising gently up and away from her ribcage. It was almost like watching two balloons fill with helium - only it was a person\u0026rsquo;s actual tits! She watched in envy as the superheroine\u0026rsquo;s already incredible body suddenly took on superhuman proportions. Her average breasts miraculously getting bigger and bigger - until she finally let out a soft moan of release and relaxed, slumping against the back wall.\nBy this point, her entire body had lost almost every visible trace of fat, having slimmed down to more easily pronounce each and every incredible curve on her newly powerful frame. Her breasts, however, had grown to a D or a DD (or possibly even bigger!), and they sat proudly unaffected by gravity \u0026ndash; challenging the flimsy spandex material to press them back against her superhuman Hyper-body.\nQuickly straightening herself up, Jennifer smoothed out her cape, took out a small blue eye-mask from the pocket of her discarded coat, and placed it snugly across the bridge of her nose before turning to the mirror to check her appearance. She cocked her hips and laughed out loud as she stuffed her coat into her locker. Snapping the lock closed, she strode confidently across the room to check herself out in the mirror one last time. Serena couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but smile as she heard Hyperwoman address her own reflection: \u0026ldquo;Damn Jennifer, are you hot or what!?\u0026rdquo; Tossing her hair and giggling, Hyperwoman turned away, tensed her calves, and rose gently into the air to fly out of the open window - presumably to attend to whatever emergency had caused her to transform in the first place.\n... As quickly as she had entered, Hyperwoman was gone - and Serena finally exhaled a deep breath as she slumped back against the wall of the bathroom stall. Quickly composing herself, she unlatched the door and walked out into the vacant room.\n\u0026ldquo;That was fucking weird,\u0026rdquo; she said aloud, and walked over to the spot on the floor where Hyperwoman\u0026rsquo;s transformation had occurred. Absentmindedly, she wandered over to Jennifer\u0026rsquo;s locker, trying to make sense out of the amazing spectacle she just witnessed. She looked down at the floor and noticed something small and reflective lying right next to her foot. Bending down to take a closer look, she was blown away by what she saw. It was the tiny thumb-sized opaque vial that Jennifer had drunk from right before she transformed!\nSerena began hyperventilating\u0026hellip; she couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe her amazing luck. She reached down and grabbed the container, uncorking it first to insure that there was, in fact, some liquid remaining on the inside. \u0026ldquo;This must be the stuff that gives Hyperwoman her super powers,\u0026rdquo; she whispered softly to herself as she recorked the vial and put in the pocket of her sweatshirt. Quickly rushing over to gather her clothes together, she started formulating ideas in her head about how she could make her own batch of this seemingly magic potion.\nSerena stuffed her belongings in the gym bag, ran out of the weight room, and hurriedly made her way up the stairs to her apartment. Once inside, she turned on her computer, laid the vial down on the table, and set in to begin her research. She frantically scoured the internet for any information on chemical analysis laboratories. Most of the sites were government-related, but she did find a few local labs - including one at the local university - that would probably suit her purposes. Serena silently thanked her parents for forcing her to enter college as a pre-med student (even though she dropped that particular program after her sophomore year) because now she would be able to make her way around a laboratory and analyze the formula without having to ask anyone for help with the machines.\n\u0026ldquo;Okay,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself, \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s the plan\u0026hellip; I go to the university lab when no one\u0026rsquo;s there, analyze this stuff with their machines, and then get the hell out. I\u0026rsquo;ll figure out how to get the ingredients themselves once I know what they are.\u0026rdquo;\nSerena picked up the little bottle and held it between her thumb and forefinger. She\u0026rsquo;d never done anything sneaky or devious in her life, and walking away with the bottle in her pocket was basically stealing, but she reasoned that the whole ordeal was too fantastic to just be a coincidence. \u0026ldquo;If I didn\u0026rsquo;t find it, someone else definitely would have,\u0026rdquo; she thought to herself. \u0026ldquo;Besides, I can\u0026rsquo;t just walk up to her apartment tomorrow and say \u0026lsquo;Hi! I saw you transform into Hyperwoman yesterday and you dropped this, thought you might need it - bye!\u0026rsquo; Looks like I\u0026rsquo;ve got no choice but to pocket it.\u0026rdquo;\nQuickly uncorking the vial, she wafted it towards her nose and peered inside. Sort of cloudy, but otherwise odorless and colorless. \u0026ldquo;I wonder how much you need to drink to get superpowers,\u0026rdquo; she thought, \u0026ldquo;Jennifer didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to hold it up to her lips for too long\u0026hellip; maybe it only takes a really little bit.\u0026rdquo;\nHolding it up to the light, she saw that the thumb-sized vial was still just about half-full. It was driving her crazy forcing herself to wait for a full analysis instead of just chugging the whole thing, but she wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to blow her chance at a lifetime of super powers for one fleeting moment of ecstasy. Recorking it, she decided she\u0026rsquo;d try to get some sleep first and then head to the university lab early the next morning before anyone else got there. With visions of herself as an all-powerful superheroine in her head, Serena got up from her chair, changed into her sleep tee, brushed her teeth, and made her way into bed.\n:: DAY II ::\nSerena glanced at her clock as soon as the sun came up. 5:45am it read. \u0026ldquo;Why did I even try to sleep last night?\u0026rdquo; she thought as she tossed her covers aside and immediately reached for the little bottle of super-juice on her nightstand - just to be sure hadn\u0026rsquo;t dreamt the whole thing. Sure enough, it was right where she left it.\nSerena got out of bed, took off her tee, and appraised her naked body in the mirror. Same old Serena. She sighed, but then stole a quick glance at the vial on her nightstand and smiled a wicked smile. Turning back to the reflection, she put her hands on her hips and puffed out her chest in the classic superheroine pose. \u0026ldquo;This looks like a job for Hyperwoman,\u0026rdquo; she said out loud, and then flexed her muscles, giggling. Of course, she was as displeased with her body as she\u0026rsquo;d always been - but that would all change today. \u0026ldquo;God, I hope this plan actually works,\u0026rdquo; she giggled, \u0026ldquo;imagine ME - a superhero! Gonna have to think of a name\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nSerena picked out her glasses and some blue cotton thong panties, then quickly threw on her regular workout uniform: a sports bra and spandex workout shorts underneath a pair of sweatpants and a long-sleeve blue tee-shirt. She was too excited to eat anything, so she just brushed her teeth, threw a pen and pad along with the vial into her backpack, and ran out the door to catch the bus. Luckily, public transportation was running on time, and she hopped on and took a seat near the back door. Serena\u0026rsquo;s knee bobbed up and down nervously as she stared out the window.\n\u0026ldquo;This is insane\u0026rdquo; she thought, and stuck her hand into the front pouch of her bag to clutch at the vial. \u0026ldquo;Just a little sip of this stuff and Jennifer Benson transformed right in front of my eyes.\u0026rdquo; Her mind drifted to Mia, her friend who had actually been working for a better body. \u0026ldquo;God, we would have killed for this stuff when we were younger. I mean\u0026hellip; the secret to Hyperwoman\u0026rsquo;s superpowers! I remember when we were just kids and Hyperwoman (it was Hypergirl then) busted onto the scene as the world\u0026rsquo;s first ever real-live superhero. Watching her fly around and pick up boulders on TV was amazing! Mia and I used to spend hours running around the neighborhood pretending to be her. If only I knew then that this day would come.\u0026rdquo;\nSerena sighed and shifted in her seat. Her gaze drifted to the other people on the bus. Guys in suits, punk kids, old ladies, homeless people\u0026hellip; all of them just going about their boring old routines. \u0026ldquo;Maybe I should tell Mia about all this. I mean - it just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be right to keep a miracle like this all to myself, and who better to share it with than her? I don\u0026rsquo;t know though. It might be dangerous\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She looked down the row of seats and saw a gorgeous woman in a skirted business suit. Every single man on board was stealing glances at her exposed legs. \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; I probably better just see if the formula works first. Then I\u0026rsquo;ll think about giving her some\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAfter arriving at the university building, she was thrilled to find the doors unlocked and the hallways completely empty. Quickly, she found her way to the chemistry lab and began her research. It had been a while since she\u0026rsquo;d used these machines - and even then, she was far from an expert - but she thankfully didn\u0026rsquo;t really have to do anything too complicated. Just a simple fluid analysis.\nSerena carefully spilled a few drops of the liquid onto a slide and placed it into the machine. After analyzing the readout, she was relieved to see that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything in the formula that she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to find close by. She jotted a few pages of notes in her notepad, silently cursing herself for dropping out of the pre-med program. Now she might be smart enough to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s inside the formula, but she\u0026rsquo;d have absolutely no idea how it worked or why! Nevertheless, all that really mattered was that she had the stuff \u0026ndash; understanding it could come later. Turning to the door, she made her exit and started going room to room gathering chemicals.\nSerena glanced at her watch. 6:25. Surely people would be arriving soon. She rushed back to the original lab and gathered all the ingredients together. Carefully, she measured out a small amount of the various chemicals - enough to make just about a half-gallon of the mysterious juice. She added the powders and liquids together into a small beaker, and waited for something to happen.\nNothing.\nShe picked up the beaker and shook it. Everything inside had mixed together, and the compound took on a sort of cloudy grey appearance, but there was no crazy explosion or anything like that. Given that this was supposed to be some kind of magical compound, Serena had been expecting to see fireworks when she got it right. Did it need to be heated up or frozen or something like that? Damn. Serena sighed, and knew she had to just drink the stuff and find out. But not at the university lab. Checking her watch one last time, she put the various ingredients into her backpack along with both bottles of formula, and made her way out of the building.\nThe ride home was the longest 15 minutes of her life, but once there, Serena unpacked the contents of her bag and laid them out on her kitchen table. If she was correct, everything she needed to make a lifetime\u0026rsquo;s worth of super-juice was right in front of her. Picking up the original vial, she decided that she\u0026rsquo;d save that one for an emergency\u0026hellip; just in case nothing ended up working and she needed the powers for a one-shot thing. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sure that even the original formula would work on her, but again\u0026hellip; she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to waste the only \u0026lsquo;original copy\u0026rsquo; of the special drink if she didn\u0026rsquo;t have to.\nSo she reached instead for the beaker she\u0026rsquo;d mixed back at the lab and held it up to the light. The liquid inside appeared to be the same color \u0026amp; consistency of the actual formula. Did she actually get it all right? Was it really this easy to get super powers? Serena shrugged her shoulders, knowing that there was really only one way to find out. Quickly running over to her computer table, she took out her digital camcorder, placed it on a chair in front of the full length mirror, turned it on, and pointed it to the center of the room.\nSlowly, Serena walked into the camera\u0026rsquo;s field of vision and turned to face it. \u0026ldquo;Well, I guess this is it,\u0026rdquo; she said and let out a nervous giggle. Hesitating, she bit her lip and reached down to pull off her sweatpants. She then removed her pullover tee and was left standing in a shiny black spandex sports bra and matching workout shorts that barely covered her behind. Turning to address the camera, Serena cleared her throat and held the beaker up in front of her. \u0026ldquo;My name is Serena Agbayani, and I think I\u0026rsquo;ve made and incredible discovery.\u0026rdquo;\n... This was it\u0026hellip; the moment she had been dreaming about since she was a little girl. Her fingers clutched the container nervously as she raised the bottle to her lips. She was shaking - what if she poisoned herself? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t she have someone there with her in case things went wrong? She paused and looked into the mouth of the beaker. The cloudy liquid looked harmless enough, and didn\u0026rsquo;t smell at all - most likely nothing would happen. Serena rolled her eyes. She was still having a hard time convincing herself the whole thing wasn\u0026rsquo;t just some kind of crazy dream or hallucination. \u0026ldquo;Ahh, what the heck,\u0026rdquo; she whispered to herself, \u0026ldquo;just drink it and get it over with already.\u0026rdquo; Looking back at the camera\u0026rsquo;s flashing red light, she took a deep breath, lifted the bottle to her lips, and took a swig.\n\u0026ldquo;Tastes like tap water,\u0026rdquo; she said as she took the beaker from her mouth and set it on the table. Pausing, she looked at the camera and waited for the magic to kick in. Nothing. She brought her arms up into a double biceps pose and flexed. Still no response. \u0026ldquo;Did I get it right?,\u0026rdquo; she wondered aloud, self-consciously adjusting the waistband of her shorts before raising her arms to flex her muscles again. \u0026ldquo;Come on\u0026hellip; come on\u0026hellip; work already!\u0026rdquo;\nShe was getting impatient - Jennifer\u0026rsquo;s transformation was instantaneous, and it had almost been a full minute now since she had downed the stuff herself. Looking back at the clock, Serena watched the second hand creep along as if in slow motion. Each tick making her feel more and more idiotic. \u0026ldquo;This is stupid,\u0026rdquo; she said, \u0026ldquo;what was I even thinking? Magic super-juice\u0026hellip; yeah right.\u0026rdquo;\nEmbarrassed to be standing half-naked in front of her video camera, Serena reached down to pick up the long-sleeve shirt. The device recorded her every movement as she stood back up and walked over to push the stop button. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I even tried this stupid stunt. Who was I kidding?\u0026rdquo; Serena could have kicked herself - she was always wasting her time with stupid immature pipe-dreams like this one. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re 22 years old already,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself, \u0026ldquo;You need to just accept your body and your life and learn to fucking deal with it already. You\u0026rsquo;re not a kid anymore.\u0026rdquo; Her finger reached out to power down the camera when suddenly, she felt a jolt of electricity shoot up her spine - continuing through her arms, legs, and head. At once, all of Serena\u0026rsquo;s muscles clenched tightly - much more tightly than they ever had before - and she was immediately overcome with incredibly painful cramps. It was like she was on fire\u0026hellip; even her head and face were burning. Instinctively, she hunched over to curl into a standing fetal position.\n\u0026ldquo;Uhhh,\u0026rdquo; she moaned, fearing for her safety. She\u0026rsquo;d never felt this much pain before in her life, and the cramps were getting worse by the second. Even her eyes now - they felt like they were about to melt! She couldn\u0026rsquo;t move, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t think. Another painful moan escaped her lips as her muscles wrapped themselves into a million tiny knots. Something was wrong. Very wrong. She groaned in pain as tears formed in the corners of her eyes. She tried to stand up straight, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t. Her body was locked in position and felt like it was collapsing on itself. She had no control at all. This was too much. Serena started panicking and hyperventilating. At that moment, she had no doubt she was about to die.\nExcept\u0026hellip; she didn\u0026rsquo;t die. And amazingly, the intense pain started to dissipate. The horrible cramps in Serena\u0026rsquo;s hands, feet, neck, and head began to leave - being replaced with what could best be described as an internal warmth. This warmth slowly spread back through her body, overtaking the cramped muscles and tendons with a soothing, tingly feeling. She found herself able to move her fingers\u0026hellip; then her hands\u0026hellip; then arms\u0026hellip; and knew she would soon be able to rise from her position. \u0026ldquo;Wh\u0026hellip; What\u0026rsquo;s happening?\u0026rdquo; she asked aloud - hoping, but not believing, that her formula might actually end up working after all.\nQuickly, however, she found herself able to stand up, arch her back, and shake out the cramps. Amazingly, they seemed to be disappearing altogether. \u0026ldquo;Wow\u0026hellip; I feel so\u0026hellip; strange,\u0026rdquo; she said as a wave of pleasant dizziness washed over her, making her shudder. Almost immediately, every last trace of achiness in her muscles had vanished, as was being replaced by another strange feeling\u0026hellip; she couldn\u0026rsquo;t quite describe it just yet.\nSerena stabilized herself with a hand on the kitchen table, her world was spinning faster and faster. Oddly, the experience was actually soothing to her, and she was overtaken by a new-found feeling of confidence. She was shocked to feel her own mind awaken as if from a deep sleep. It was as if a mental veil was being lifted, and her thoughts could finally flow freely\u0026hellip; she actually could feel her neurons begin to fire faster and faster. \u0026ldquo;Oh my gosh,\u0026rdquo; she said aloud in an almost breathless whisper, \u0026ldquo;this is soooo strange!\u0026rdquo;\nThe sensation continued to grow until it traveled to the outside of her head - to her scalp - and began to resemble the same warm tingle from before. The unfamiliar feelings were almost too much to take, and Serena clenched her calves involuntarily. By now, her head felt much better than during any scalp-massage she\u0026rsquo;d ever gotten, and she tilted her neck back, allowing herself to get lost in the pleasant sensations.\n\u0026ldquo;Ohh wow,\u0026rdquo; she breathed heavily as the amazing feeling in her temples got even stronger, distracting her from the small pops and clicks her body was making as it readjusted itself, \u0026ldquo;this is unbelievable.\u0026rdquo;\nSerena tossed her head from one side to the other and suddenly had her daze broken by the distracting touch of something gliding across her back. She quickly reached up to scratch at whatever it was (a bug?) that was crawling on her skin, and was awestruck to grab a fistful of hair \u0026ndash; her own hair!\n\u0026ldquo;Ohmygodohmygodohmygod\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Serena jumped back to face the camera and the mirror. Was it really happening!? Yes! \u0026ndash; her hair had grown down her back just like Hyperwoman\u0026rsquo;s! And that amazing tingly feeling\u0026hellip; it had to be the formula working! Serena was ecstatic, and she quickly straightened herself up, shaking out her long, flowing chestnut brown hair. By this point it had grown almost to her butt, and had actually developed a few patches of shimmery blonde highlights. She was shocked at how it seemed to glow from the inside with its own light. It was the most beautiful head of hair she\u0026rsquo;d ever seen \u0026ndash; even in the movies or on TV \u0026ndash; and it was hers! This was too much!\nSerena then knew without hesitation that her body was having a positive reaction to the formula. Her thoughts raced without tripping over themselves, and she realized beyond a shadow of a doubt that everything happening to her was meant to be\u0026hellip; that it had been her destiny to have ingested the formula.\nShe gave herself a once over in the mirror. \u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; she thought, \u0026ldquo;nothing else seems to have changed yet. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to miss the show!\u0026rdquo; She reached up with both hands to pull her hair back into a makeshift ponytail. The warmth was now heading back into her head, becoming a more generalized feeling that seemed to literally seep into her brain! \u0026ldquo;Mmmmm,\u0026rdquo; she moaned again, unable to equate the sensation with any she had ever felt. Then\u0026hellip; almost instantaneously, she felt a burst of energy travel from her head all the way down her spine, through her arms \u0026amp; legs, and all the way back again. It was like an electric current going through her, and she was rewarded with a flash in her eyes, ears, and skin \u0026ndash; even inside her mouth. What happened? She wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure, but something was very different. It was like the strange warm \u0026amp; tingly feeling was no longer going through her, but had somehow become a part of her.\nShe opened her eyes and was shocked by the clarity of her vision! Throwing her glasses to the ground, she was blown away by her eyesight - which was suddenly much better than 20/20. Every color, every nuance of each object in her field of vision was so vivid! And her ears\u0026hellip; every single noise was crystal clear\u0026hellip; the birds, the dripping faucet, the vent in the hallway! Her senses had sharpened to superhuman levels and she felt the need to just laugh hysterically. \u0026ldquo;Oh my god, this is sooooooo amazing!!\u0026rdquo;\nSerena was beside herself, trying desperately to catch every new sensation\u0026hellip; to make sure not one instant of pleasure passed by unappreciated. This was a hundred times more intense than she had imagined. Slowly, the warm feeling that had worked its way deep into her body grew hotter and hotter. From the inside of her bones to her organs to the tips of her toes, Serena\u0026rsquo;s body responded to the increased warmth by pulling itself into a new, more \u0026lsquo;suitable\u0026rsquo; shape \u0026ndash; smoothing out the imperfections in her skin, loosening muscles and joints that had been wrongly set by years of poor posture, and twisting the flesh to create perfect symmetry on the left and right sides. The warmth spread into her back, and her muscles involuntarily jerked her body to attention. She found herself standing strongly upright with an arched back and her ass exaggeratedly sticking out behind her. Her arms hung loosely by her sides, but upon seeing her reflection in the mirror, she placed her hands on her hips and found herself standing in an exact copy of Hyperwoman\u0026rsquo;s power pose.\n\u0026ldquo;Whoa,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed as she looked at her reflection. Though her body remained largely unchanged, the subtle shifts in her basic appearance were becoming noticeable. Quickly, she examined herself with her newfound super-vision. It was incredible\u0026hellip; as though her super-sight allowed her to closely study every single pore on her entire body at once! And not a blemish to be found at all. Not a single one!\nHer skin had lost every trace of a wrinkle, and become perfectly soft and clean. Even the childhood scar on her chin had disappeared. And now the features of her face began to shift one by one. Serena had always wanted a slightly thinner nose and \u0026lsquo;zap\u0026rsquo;, she watched as the bridge pulled itself inward just a fraction. She always thought her lips were a little too thin and \u0026lsquo;poof\u0026rsquo;, she was delighted to see them become fuller and sexier. She felt her cheekbones shift a bit higher, and her chin draw itself in a bit more. Her eyes remained a dark brown, but they now seemed to glow with the same internal light as her gorgeous hair. Serena could still tell it was her\u0026hellip; but she looked way different than before. It was like checking out a super-hot version of herself! This was unreal! She couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe that she \u0026ndash; Serena Agbayani \u0026ndash; was watching her face transform from plain Jane to supermodel status! She puckered her lips and winked at herself before launching into a full toothy smile. \u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; she gasped, \u0026ldquo;even my teeth are straight!\u0026rdquo;\nShe smiled and frowned and smiled again, as if to test that the face in the mirror was really hers. Then she glanced down at the video camera. \u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; she thought as she posed \u0026amp; blew a kiss to the lens, \u0026ldquo;I am getting this whole thing on tape.\u0026rdquo; This was the experience of a lifetime. She\u0026rsquo;d never really done any hard drugs, but she knew that not even ecstasy or heroine could duplicate these amazing feelings. Her reflection stared back at her with a look of confidence wholly unfamiliar to the old Serena. Her hair was long and flowing, her face was breathtaking and flawless, and even at just 5'3, her posture was majestic and commanding.\nSerena looked down at her still-untoned waistline in anticipation. Her face was incredible, and she felt healthier and happier on the inside than ever before, but she knew her body had just been getting itself ready\u0026hellip; clearing the skin, bones, organs, and tendons\u0026hellip; in preparation for the final infusion of super-powers. Finally, the moment of truth was at hand, and Serena felt the warmth that had spread across her body start to gather in her chest. This was what she had been waiting for. Her dream of becoming a super-hot superheroine was finally about to come true!\nShe appraised herself in the mirror. Now a miraculously pretty girl, Serena still had her same old body. But that was about to change. Her full lips curled into a smile as her heart started beating faster, the warmth in her chest again growing hotter and hotter. She remembered this same buildup of power from earlier, but this time, she knew what was about to happen. Softly, Serena reached up to brush a strand of hair from her face, then clenched her fists and gave herself a dead-serious stare in the mirror. This was it. She could feel her heart beating faster and the warmth in her chest reaching it\u0026rsquo;s critical point. Slowly, a dizziness started to creep over her again (she thought she was done with this dizzy stuff already!), but she managed to keep her eyes open this time, instinctively clenching her fists and tightening the muscles in her arms and legs. Her heart beat faster still, until she just about lost her balance. Determined to maintain control, Serena raised her arms in front of her, then flexed her biceps, shoulders, and pecs in defiance. The warmth then spread\u0026hellip; branching out and radiating up her spine to her head, then down her stomach into her crotch. \u0026ldquo;MMMM,\u0026rdquo; she moaned loudly, caught off guard by the blatantly erotic sensation that suddenly gripped her privates.\nOnce again, Serena felt her muscles cramping up - taking control of her posture. She felt her arms moving even further in front of her, bending her over to hunch down yet again in a standing fetal position. But this time, once she had fully knelt down, her heart immediately clenched and exploded in one mighty beat \u0026ndash; sending a blast of supercharged blood coursing through her.\nSerena was overcome with an erotic and powerful sensation as she instantly shot up into the opposite position\u0026hellip; her back again arching itself, her arms throwing themselves straight out to either side in a \u0026ldquo;T\u0026rdquo; formation. Her legs closed tightly together and her butt was sticking out exaggeratedly behind her. She threw her head back in ecstasy as the fantastic power washed through her veins. Managing to open her eyes and peer at her reflection, Serena started laughing and crying at the same time! It was happening! It was really really happening!\nSerena could feel her insides burning with a pleasant sensation, the radiant waves in her crotch and chest washing over her body. Through squinting eyes, she watched as the layer of baby-fat which had plagued her self-image since childhood miraculously began to disappear! The magic started in her toes and fingertips, and crept its way inch by inch across her entire body. Bit by bit, Serena watched as her skin grew more and more taut \u0026ndash; wrapping itself tightly around her arms and legs as though it was a bag that was vacuum-sealing her muscles inside. At the same time, Serena could feel her muscles begin to grow\u0026hellip; the fibers bursting, dividing, and rebuilding themselves with inhuman speed.\nShe opened her eyes wide to take in as much of the view as possible, when her body suddenly shuddered in pleasure. From out of nowhere, her privates started to throb \u0026ndash; and she was abruptly dragged across the line from \u0026lsquo;tingly\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;very aroused\u0026rsquo;. \u0026ldquo;W h o a . . .\u0026rdquo; she giggled - and instinctively tried to bring her hand to her crotch to ease the pleasurable discomfort. Unfortunately for Serena, she found herself unable to move \u0026ndash; her body locked in the standing \u0026ldquo;T\u0026rdquo; position \u0026ndash; as her muscles continued to flex and grow.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh wow,\u0026rdquo; she uttered to herself, rubbing her thighs together to try for a little relief. Her body was changing rapidly now - the fat all but completely disappearing from her frame. At the same time, her muscles were slowly revealing their definition through her increasingly taut skin. With each passing moment, her physique became more and more athletic. Serena laughed in ecstasy as she watched herself gradually change from \u0026lsquo;sort of chubby\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;cute \u0026amp; petite\u0026rsquo;\u0026hellip; and then from \u0026lsquo;petite\u0026rsquo; all the way through to \u0026lsquo;tight little hardbody.\u0026rsquo; The whole thing felt amazing! She was watching in slow motion as her every flaw vanished from existence. No longer would she have to worry about how people looked at her - she was going to be super-hot! Serena laughed again. She was going to be the most gorgeous, desirable woman on the planet \u0026ndash; and she\u0026rsquo;d be able to have any (or every) guy she wanted! Another burst of energy flowed through her crotch, and her body shuddered yet again.\nIn the mirror, Serena saw the ridges in her stomach begin to emerge. Her hips and waist had slimmed down considerably, and now her hardening abdominal and oblique muscles were rising into view. Similar reactions were happening in the other areas of her body. Her arms, her legs, her chest and ass, everywhere\u0026hellip; hard tight muscles began slowly revealing themselves. Her heart was beating even faster now, and Serena could feel the blood flowing at what felt like light-speed through her veins.\nThe sensation continued to gather in between her legs, and it was absolutely amazing! She had never felt more alive in her whole life! Her physique continued to improve, slimming down in some areas and building mass in others, until finally she started to resemble the cover of a fitness magazine. Her prayers were finally being answered! She was no longer trapped inside a pear-shaped frame\u0026hellip; she was now the owner of the most beautiful, tight, cut, fit, hot body on the planet! She looked like a dancer or a swimmer or\u0026hellip; or a fitness model. It was just too good to believe!\nSlowly, she stopped flexing her arms \u0026ndash; having packed them with a decent bit of muscle (but not a whole lot) \u0026ndash; and allowed them to fall to rest at her sides. Likewise, her legs and the rest of her body relaxed just a bit, allowing her to resume a regular comfortable standing position. The erotic feeling started to subside, but Serena could tell that her body was just taking a small break before entering the critical phase of its transformation.\nAs she regained control of her limbs, she brought her right hand to her thigh and absentmindedly began tracing her fingers up the inside seam of her spandex workout shorts. \u0026ldquo;God, Serena\u0026hellip; LOOK at you!\u0026rdquo; She was panting and she felt like she was sweating, but strangely, she didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be perspiring at all. Then quickly, she found herself very able to catch her breath. It was unreal \u0026ndash; in an instant, she felt entirely rested \u0026ndash; like she hadn\u0026rsquo;t just been terribly exhausted only a few moments earlier! Her heart was still beating with the same ferocity\u0026hellip; but now, Serena did not feel overwhelmed by the rush of blood through her system. It just felt right. Everything felt right. And she felt in control of it all.\nShe raised her head again and looked at her reflection. Wow. Things were MUCH different now. Just a few minutes earlier, she had been as average and unremarkable as a girl could be. No one would have thought twice passing her on the street. Now she was staring face-to-face with what could possibly be the most gorgeous female specimen on the planet! Her eyes, nose, mouth\u0026hellip; her whole face\u0026hellip; there were NO flaws! She mentally catalogued all the famous asian actresses and models that she could remember\u0026hellip; none of them could hold a candle to her now! Her features were so delicate and feminine. It was just too much. And now her body too! Finding herself back in control, she smiled and lifted her arm, flexing her bicep with all her might. Grunting, Serena watched as a hard mound rose from beneath her flesh to form a baseball sized rock of muscle, the connecting tendons and muscles in her shoulder and forearm also springing to life to display perfect anatomical definition. She was aghast. Her arm suddenly looked as though it belonged on a female bodybuilder - even though the rest of her body remained tantalizingly slim and petite. The impressive size and density of her own bicep startled her, and she slowly lowered her arm to rest at her side.\n\u0026ldquo;Whoa,\u0026rdquo; was all she could say, impressed and almost stricken with fear at the strength she doubtlessly now possessed, \u0026ldquo;it really is true\u0026hellip; the formula works.\u0026rdquo; Though she had been witness to the changes one by one, the view and feeling of her arm flexing to superhuman proportions left no trace of doubt, and she stood back in awe of her own newfound physical power. She felt like she could move mountains. Serena drew a deep breath as she came to realize the gravity of her situation. This was not just some immature childish experiment anymore. This was real life\u0026hellip; and everything would be different now. Very different.\nShe stared blankly at her reflection. Incredible physical beauty. Her face and body were absolutely flawless. Though still just 5'3, her legs now seemed to go for miles. Hard calves led to thick thighs that blended seamlessly into a tight, bulging ass - barely tucked away anymore under her tight spandex running shorts. She moved both hands back to grip her own behind, and took a handful of soft, rounded flesh in each hand. Serena flexed her arms with all her might, and again, all the muscles from her shoulders to her forearms exploded with definition.\nShe just had to continue smiling, delighting in the power and raw physical beauty she now possessed. She gripped her hands more forcefully and stared intently at her forearms. Tight and petite, but super-powerful \u0026ndash; they led up past her biceps into beautifully rounded shoulders. Her back was broad, and displayed an impressive latticework of tight, bulging muscles. It tapered down to a super-tiny waist, then dramatically flared out into a trim, but relatively voluptuous set of hips. Her stomach was now lined with a hard 6-pack, and the small of her back had tightened up considerably, lifting her muscular butt cheeks skyward without even really being asked to do so. Serena was in awe of all the changes that had taken place. She was trying desperately to catalogue each little difference in her mind. She studied her face, her hands, her legs, everything. Her beauty was truly beyond measure. No regular woman could even compare anymore\u0026hellip; not even come close.\nSoon, she noticed the warm feeling gathering again, and then realized the best part had not yet even happened! Her tits! Serena quickly composed herself, standing up as straight as she could. She was startled for a moment at just how smoothly and effortlessly her new body moved itself. The way her legs just pulled together and her spine stiffened to make her stand up perfectly straight\u0026hellip; it was such an amazing feeling! She just couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe that even performing such a simple task as standing up straight could inspire such amazing feelings of power and confidence. She really felt like she could do anything!\nThe feeling of power in her chest began to build, and as it did, a new and entirely pleasurable feeling began to stimulate her nipples and clitoris. \u0026ldquo;Ohhh,\u0026rdquo; she cried as she reflexively stood back up at attention, actually raising up on her tiptoes as she arched her back and thrust her breasts and ass out exaggeratedly. Serena stared wide-eyed at herself in the mirror. \u0026ldquo;God you look sooooo damn good! I can\u0026rsquo;t believe it! Serena \u0026ndash; you\u0026rsquo;re a fucking goddess!\u0026rdquo;\nThis new feeling was like nothing that had preceded it\u0026hellip; it was not warmth disguised as dizziness, or dizziness disguised as tingles\u0026hellip; this was an entirely erotic feeling - one that centered around her most sensitive parts and only got progressively stronger. She laughed and cooed as she felt a sensation like someone\u0026rsquo;s warm mouth softly sucking her nipples and clitoris. \u0026ldquo;hahahhha\u0026hellip;. oh wow,\u0026rdquo; she whispered as the sensations began to pulse and flicker almost in exact sync with the quickening beats of her heart. It was not long before her breathing lapsed into an aroused panting, and she soon felt a few drops of moisture forming deep between her thighs.\nOne after another, the pulsing sensations flowed from her chest to her skin, and Serena laughed and exulted in the most pleasurable sensations of her life. In a few moments, she started to feel a rumbling deep within her chest. This was it! This was the signal that they were about to grow! Still standing on her tiptoes with her body arched, Serena stared in amazement as the pulsing sensations started to actually cause her breasts to begin expanding.\nHurriedly, she brought her arms to her chest and removed her sports bra, pulling it frantically up and over her head. For the first time in her life, she had exposed her \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; cup breasts to a camera \u0026ndash; but she knew she didn’t have to be embarrassed anymore! Serena settled down onto her heels, standing with her feet slightly spread, and placed her hands back on her hips. Thinking back quickly to the previous day, she recalled watching Jennifer Benson transform, and the feelings of wonderment that it inspired in her. Well, now it was her turn \u0026ndash; and she smiled confidently as she felt the soft tissue inside her breasts becoming firmer and firmer. Smiling to herself, Serena pushed her hands firmly into her waist, cocked her hips, and tossed her lustrous hair over her shoulder. She stared into the mirror with a cocky smile, and in her best superheroine voice said laughingly \u0026ldquo;This looks like a job for Hyperwoman!\u0026rdquo;\nAs if on cue, Serena\u0026rsquo;s tight little body powered a furious rush of superhuman energy from her heart into her breasts. She watched in amazement as each powerful beat caused her breasts to press outward just a little bit. First her nipples (which had always been extra-perky) began to puff out even further. They poked forwards, pulsing up and out - almost as if being tugged by strings. It felt to Serena as though they were being twisted, pinched, and softly pulled at the same time. Laughing, she felt the soft flesh deep inside her breasts beginning to grow, and soon saw confirmation as the skin on the outsides began to puff out in perfect half-circles. \u0026ldquo;Yes!\u0026rdquo;, she laughed hysterically as the erotic feelings continued to grip her most erogenous zones, \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s happening! It\u0026rsquo;s happening!\u0026rdquo;\nHer incredible body - with its tiny frame, wide hips, thin waist, and broad shoulders - would have already satisfied the fantasies of any man on earth. But Serena felt the burning in her chest continue, and her body maintained its determined course to become something more than merely \u0026ldquo;the hottest body on Earth,\u0026rdquo; it was striving to becoming absolutely goddess-like in its inhuman perfection.\nWaves of pleasure flowed through Serena\u0026rsquo;s crotch, the steady stream of energy now inducing a gradual build-up deep in her loins - similar to an impending orgasm! This was unexpected! Serena felt her body exploding with incredible power as her newly transformed muscles gripped themselves tightly, and her superhuman organs churned with a feverish intensity. The skin on her chest began to stretch tighter and tighter\u0026hellip; the breast tissue underneath beginning to double its rate of growth. Serena lifted her hands from her waist, bringing them up and over her head. She then brought them down to flex both of her arms in a mighty double biceps pose. Like tiny packages of dynamite, her biceps exploded into compact, dense spheres of steel-hardened muscle - and the connecting muscles in her forearms and shoulders started to quiver.\nThe electric feeling immediately flowed from her biceps through her shoulders, and across the now flexing muscles of her chest - to deliver a powerful stream of energy that instantly supercharged the growth process. Serena was thrown into a fit of uncontrollable laughter as she watched her reflection. Her arms\u0026hellip; they were gorgeous! and so strong! And her breasts\u0026hellip; she watched as the tissue that had been growing underneath finally began to push its way out, causing them to rise. Her tits were now visibly inflating\u0026hellip; not just the nipples or the sides\u0026hellip; but Serena could see actual shadows beginning to fall across the inside of her chest - creating cleavage where she\u0026rsquo;d never had anything but an unobstructed view of her own sternum. She was ecstatic!\nFlexing harder, Serena felt another rush of power flow into her breasts, and at the same time, she actually felt herself getting\u0026hellip; lighter (?) Her tits started to balloon outwards, and the shadow on her chest got deeper and deeper as the ridge between her breasts became more and more exaggerated. The growth was happening quite rapidly now, and Serena was absolutely delighted. Her tits grew from an A to a B cup, and then even further, as they really started to bulge. Though she was completely bare chested, her marvelous tits held themselves aloft as though supported by an invisible bra. It was unreal! Her pussy continued to pulsate in time with the growth of her breasts, and Serena found herself in a trance-like state\u0026hellip; part of her extremely in tune with every minor detail of her physical changes, the other part of her lost in a state of sexual arousal that had long ago surpassed anything she\u0026rsquo;d ever felt.\nAdmiring her superhuman body in the mirror, Serena held fast to her position. It seemed that the harder she flexed, the more aroused she got, and the more powerful her body became. She clenched her muscles again, and felt the effects of another wave of pleasure and power. Her breathing quickened even further. The flesh in her breasts continued to pulsate and expand, each millimeter of growth causing flashes of heat to run back and forth from her crotch to her tits. She stared hard at them. Serena wanted to reach down and cup herself \u0026ndash; to feel the soft warmth of her expanding tits as they bounded well into the \u0026lsquo;C\u0026rsquo; cup range. The way they sat so high and proud on her chest despite her incredibly tight \u0026amp; petite body. The sight was breathtaking! And they were her tits! She flexed even tighter and watched as they continued to expand\u0026hellip; it was almost like watching two helium balloons fill in slow motion\u0026hellip; except it wasn\u0026rsquo;t helium, but her own super-powered breast tissue that was inflating them.\nHer blood raced. Serena\u0026rsquo;s eyes remained locked on her chest, darting back and forth from nipple to nipple, and then zooming out to watch both breasts heaving and expanding at once. Her body was so little and tight\u0026hellip; but her breasts\u0026hellip; they had always been tiny, and now they were getting huge!! Her entire body was flexing hard, vigorously pumping superhuman energy through her veins. Her clitoris was throbbing and aching, daring Serena to reach down and touch it. She almost gave in to the urge to stroke herself, when suddenly she began to feel as though her pussy were being manipulated by a hundred tiny fingers and tongues.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh goddddddddddddd!\u0026rdquo; Serena labored to breathe as she struggled to keep her arms flexed. She forced herself to concentrate on her amazing expanding tits. God, they were amazing \u0026ndash; and all hers!! She flexed hard, and her pussy began to drip\u0026hellip; moisture beginning to show through the tight spandex workout shorts that now hugged her thighs and ass like a second skin. Her breasts grew even further\u0026hellip; blooming out into a full-fledged \u0026lsquo;D\u0026rsquo; cup as they bounced effortlessly on her tiny frame. Her pussy was on fire now, but though she hadn\u0026rsquo;t laid a finger on herself, she felt as though she were being worked by an expert\u0026hellip; bringing her ever closer to her impending release.\nSerena\u0026rsquo;s arms remained flexed, her eyes completely fixated on her breasts and the super powers they represented. Her tiny super-powerful body pumped wave after wave of incredible feelings into her chest and crotch, and soon, she could take no more. With a powerful grunt, Serena pumped all of her muscles as hard as she could. Over and over she flexed. Her arms, her legs, her back, her ass, her stomach, her neck\u0026hellip; everything. The buildup of energy was overwhelming. The skin on her breasts drew taut, refusing to give anymore, but the powerful flesh inside them continued to grow. The competing tensions felt so incredible! Her tits were so huge now, and they rose even higher off her frame with each flex. She was now only seconds away from coming.\nAn intense feeling of heat suddenly started to build from deep within her. She pulled her arms down and clenched her fists as tightly as she ever had. The feeling spread, creeping through her skin and bones, and working its way into each and every cell. She got hotter. And hotter. The sensations getting more and more intense until finally, without warning, her pussy exploded into the most violent, super-powerful orgasm of her life.\n\u0026ldquo;AAHHHH!\u0026rdquo; Serena was thrown back against the wall, her super-body cracking the plaster and denting the bricks in the process. She pulsed over and over again\u0026hellip; overcome with feelings of pleasure and power. It was such an incredible mixture. Serena brought her hand down to her crotch and gripped it with all her might. She flexed strongly, powerful muscles appearing on her slender arm as her fingers expertly manipulated her g-spot. Panting, she fell onto her knees, one hand still on her crotch, the other supporting her weight on the ground, and continued moving her hand back and forth. She stroked herself again and again, the overwhelming feelings maintaining peak intensity for well over sixty seconds, until finally the orgasm of her life began to subside.\nAnother minute later and Serena was able to catch her breath. She flipped her head up to face the video camera and started laughing. Her chest was heaving, she was practically spread eagle in a crawling position on the ground, and her sweat and pussy juices had completely soaked through her shorts. \u0026ldquo;He he he\u0026hellip; oh wow\u0026hellip; That was something else\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Peeling off her bottoms, Serena slowly sat back and folded her knees underneath her. Suddenly, she was caught off guard by the sensation of two enormous breasts dancing up and down on her previously flat-as-a-board chest. \u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; she said as she lifted her left hand to cup herself. \u0026ldquo;Ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod.\u0026rdquo;\nHer pulse began to slow down just a touch, and effortlessly, Serena bounced up to her feet. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how quickly her body responded to her every command. Standing to face herself in the mirror, her jaw dropped in amazement. \u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod.\u0026rdquo;\n\nHer body had become the most incredible female body that had ever existed. Small and compact, but voluptuous. Fit. Powerful. But also soft and incredibly delicate. She stood up straight\u0026hellip; her neck was long and lean like a ballerina\u0026rsquo;s. Her whole body was slim and trim \u0026ndash; except for her tits! They were huge\u0026hellip; must be a \u0026lsquo;D\u0026rsquo; cup (at least!) She reached her hands up to cup herself and gave each breast a super-powerful squeeze. Her arms exploded into hard cuts of muscle, but her breasts only gave a little bit\u0026hellip; responding with a feeling of softness and pleasure rather than pain or soreness. They were soft and warm\u0026hellip; and when Serena pushed and pulled on them, they moved and squished around like normal tits. But they also displayed a miraculous elasticity, and didn\u0026rsquo;t droop or sag or anything! She let her fingers glide across her awesome new cleavage and trace lines down the soft undersides of her new super-tits. Finally she cupped herself again, and quickly brought her hands away. Her gravity-defying breasts jiggled and stood at attention. \u0026ldquo;Look at me,\u0026rdquo; she marveled, \u0026ldquo;I am a goddess.\u0026rdquo;\nSerena backed away from the mirror, walking over to the other side of the room. With each step, she felt more and more alive \u0026ndash; more and more powerful. Every single motion was so easy. She moved with grace and style. Rising up on her feet, she did a quick pirouette before stopping and lifting herself onto one toe. She had so much balance! This was awesome! Serena laughed out loud and launched into a series of spins and jumps that took her through her living room and bedroom, and finally back into the kitchen. She was moving like a prima-ballerina\u0026hellip; and she had never even taken a single dance class in her entire life!\n\nShe ran back to face herself in the mirror, moving in to look close up at her face. No flaws. Nothing. She was perfect. She reached up and pulled her cheeks down\u0026hellip; not even any redness in the corners of her eyes! Insanity! Puckering up, Serena leaned in to the mirror and pressed her lips against it to give herself a big kiss. \u0026ldquo;You did it,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself, \u0026ldquo;you actually, really, honestly, truly did it!\u0026rdquo; She appraised her wondrous body\u0026hellip; marveling at the super-tight muscles and incredible hourglass figure that had been combined on her frame. Raising her fist, she flexed - watching again as a rock-hard bicep rose up exaggeratedly from her slender arm. Serena tossed her hair over her shoulder and smiled wickedly at her reflection. \u0026ldquo;Ok then, you goddess\u0026hellip; I think it\u0026rsquo;s time you find out what this new body can do!\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/2021/02/serenas-lucky-day-01/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Serenas Lucky Day Part 1"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"A regular girl discovers the secret of the world\u0026rsquo;s mightiest superheroine\n:: DAY II continued :: Serena stood up straight with both arms hanging loosely at her sides. Her body was completely nude \u0026ndash; and completely flawless. There was not a single blemish or stretch mark to be found on her tanned flesh, and her proportions were something out of a comic book. She tilted her head back, taking a deep breath and allowing her large, firm breasts to rise higher on her chest. Exhaling strongly, Serena was amazed when the video camera \u0026amp; all the papers on the kitchen table suddenly went flying - scattering themselves across the room. \u0026ldquo;What the\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she wondered aloud, quickly realizing that it had been her breath - the air from her lungs - that had blown the contents of the room around.\n\u0026ldquo;No way,\u0026rdquo; she said \u0026ldquo;can I really do that!?\u0026rdquo; She walked over to the video camera and picked it up off the ground. Good, it hadn\u0026rsquo;t been damaged. Placing it back on the table, Serena couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but turn around one more time to check herself out in the mirror. Her ass was fantastic. She stuck her butt out and put her palm squarely on the tight flesh that connected it to the small of her back. With a quick flex of her thigh, all the muscles on her leg carved themselves into tightly defined bunches. Her perky behind gripped itself tightly, and Serena allowed her fingers to trace the striations through her super-tight skin. Simply amazing. Her body was hard and strong like a marble statue, but her shape was delicate and feminine. Serena relaxed her leg and turned back around to face the camera, the feeling of her large breasts bobbing up and down causing her to laugh with self-satisfaction. \u0026ldquo;Okay,\u0026rdquo; she said as turned to face the other side of the room, \u0026ldquo;here goes nothing.\u0026rdquo;\nSerena looked intently at the bag of dirty clothes that she had gathered by her bedroom door. \u0026ldquo;Okay that\u0026rsquo;s got to be at least 15 or 20 feet away from me, right?\u0026rdquo; she said to the camera. \u0026ldquo;Now let me see if I can just\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nShe took a deep breath, filling her lungs with air, and then exhaled with all her might. She was instantly rewarded by the unfamiliar feeling of hurricane force winds escaping from between her tightly pursed lips. The bag of clothes leapt off the ground, and Serena watched in amazement as it lifted up to fly straight into her dresser. The bag burst on impact, sending shirts and socks flying every which way. Cosmetics and accessories spilled across the floor, and her framed pictures all fell from the wall, shattering on the floor.\nSerena instinctively raised her hands to her ears and squinted at the cacophony - caught off guard yet again by the incredible clarity of sound she was able to perceive. \u0026ldquo;Seven hundred and thirty six,\u0026rdquo; she said nonchalantly, before realizing that she had subconsciously counted the pieces of glass as they fell to the floor. She dropped her hands back to her sides and repeated the number. \u0026ldquo;Seven hundred and thirty six.\u0026rdquo; She shook her head. \u0026ldquo;Seven thirty six.\u0026rdquo; Serena looked at the pile on the ground and was amazed as her eyes focused in - darting quickly from piece to piece - her mind easily taking note of which ones she had seen yet and which ones she had not. No more than three seconds later, her superhuman eyes had confirmed what her superhuman ears just told her. 736 pieces of broken glass. Not a doubt in her mind. \u0026ldquo;No way,\u0026rdquo; she breathed. \u0026ldquo;No fucking way.\u0026rdquo;\nSerena ran to the window and looked down at the roadway. \u0026ldquo;One twenty two,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself, then quickly counted the number of cars parked along the street. She was spot-on. \u0026ldquo;No way no way no way!\u0026rdquo; She looked at the tree across the street. \u0026ldquo;Thirteen thousand four hundred and ten,\u0026rdquo; she said confidently as she instantly counted the number of leaves on its branches. Serena laughed hysterically. \u0026ldquo;My brain! Even my brain is super!\u0026rdquo;\nShe ran over to her bookshelf and pulled a few titles down. \u0026ldquo;Moby Dick,\u0026rdquo; she noted, \u0026ldquo;I had always meant to read that.\u0026rdquo; Opening the cover, Serena smiled as she instantly digested the contents. Page by page she flipped through with increasing speed until she finally just held the book between her thumb and forefinger, and flipped through as though shuffling a deck of cards. Even at that speed, Serena didn\u0026rsquo;t miss a word, and was shocked to discover she fully comprehended every nuance of the entire novel. \u0026ldquo;Not only am I strong, but super-smart too! This is awesome!\u0026rdquo;\nSerena was beside herself. \u0026ldquo;Okokokokok, you need to slow down and THINK, girl! First: you need to get out of this house before you tear it down! Second: you need to go somewhere quiet and secluded, and put yourself through some tests. Third: you need to think about what you\u0026rsquo;re going to do with these powers once you\u0026rsquo;ve got \u0026lsquo;em under control.\u0026rdquo;\nSerena turned back to the mirror - still overcome with pride in her new \u0026amp; improved body. \u0026ldquo;Have no fear, Serena is here,\u0026rdquo; she laughed to herself as she put her hands on her hips. Now that was more like it! Her super tight muscles glistened in the light of the room as her large breasts heaved in steady rhythm with her breathing. Her flawless face and flowing hair were the epitome of female perfection. Her legs went on for miles. \u0026ldquo;God damn, Serena - LOOK at you!\u0026rdquo; She raised herself up onto one toe and twirled around a half-dozen times before gracefully settling back down on her heels in the exact same position. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re fucking perfect!\u0026rdquo;\nDeciding she needed to get out of her house, Serena walked back into her room to find something to wear. Every single motion was graceful and perfectly efficient as she made her way over to the dresser. \u0026ldquo;What to wear, what to wear,\u0026rdquo; she mused as she lifted out her favorite \u0026lsquo;special\u0026rsquo; pair of red silk thong panties. Sliding them up her legs, she moved on to pick up shirt after shirt\u0026hellip; all of them having been tailored and stretched to fit a girl with much smaller boobs and a much bigger belly. The only articles that looked like they would fit were some pullover sweatshirts, and there was no way Serena was going to bury herself in one of those now. Eventually getting frustrated, Serena walked back over and picked her sportsbra off the ground, holding it up by the tag. \u0026ldquo;34A\u0026rdquo; she read aloud, and smiled from ear to ear as she walked back to the mirror, twirling the bra around her fingers.\nSerena faced her reflection, still overcome by the sight of her new super-petite body. She turned to the side and took in the incredible view of her large breasts as they jutted out of her profile. God, they were gigantic! And so firm and bouncy. Turning back straight ahead, Serena put both her arms out to the sides \u0026amp; rocked up and down on her heels. She watched in delight as her pendulous breasts swayed back and forth before eventually settling back into position. She reached her hand over and placed it in squarely between her tits, feeling their fullness as they surrounded her fingers. She then brought her arms forward and watched as her cleavage almost completely swallowed her hand. Serena\u0026rsquo;s fingertips poked out the top, but otherwise, her hand had been completely covered by the flesh of her brand new tits. She laughed absently as she pulled her hand out from between her breasts, causing them to jiggle for a moment before once again standing up at attention.\nWith one quick motion, Serena reached down to take her bra in both hands. She brought it up over her head and dropped it loosely over her shoulders. Tugging with both hands, she stretched the fabric out almost to the breaking point before pulling it down to stretch across her buoyant tits. God, they looked so good! She hooked her thumbs under the fabric for a second before letting it go, and was delighted by the way her firm chest prevented the flat-cupped top from reaching back to her ribcage. The black lycra fabric strained in protest as the underside of Serena\u0026rsquo;s new breasts stuck visibly out the bottom. \u0026ldquo;Aww\u0026hellip; what\u0026rsquo;s the matter, Serena,\u0026rdquo; she mock pouted, \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t find anything big enough to hold back your super boobs?\u0026rdquo; She thought back to her experiences in high school and junior high school - when she\u0026rsquo;d felt totally ostracized because of her weight problem and lack of \u0026lsquo;frontal development.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Well who\u0026rsquo;s laughing now,\u0026rdquo; she purred confidently.\nSerena put her hands on her hips and puffed out her chest even further. Her enhanced hearing picked up the sound of hundreds of tiny threads ripping as her breasts inflated slightly in time with her breathing. It was amazing the way they puffed out the top and bottom, her cleavage going on for days thanks to the too-small bra that now pressed her tits into one another. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t get over the way they stood out and made her hips look so small. She flexed her abdominals and one by one, they stood out in bold relief underneath her tanned skin. Relaxing again, Serena\u0026rsquo;s muscles slimmed down, and her body reduced its bulk to once again become incredibly lithe and petite. It was mind-boggling. How could her body change from super-cut to baby-soft so quickly? She took her hands off her hips and put them on her knees. Bending over and thrusting her chest and tits out, Serena simulated a pose she\u0026rsquo;d seen recently in a Playboy spread. She had to laugh\u0026hellip; she really looked just too damn hot for her own good.\nSerena stood back up and shook her head. \u0026ldquo;Snap out of it,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself, \u0026ldquo;you look fantastic, but there\u0026rsquo;s so much more to it than that!\u0026rdquo; She looked over at the dirty clothes and broken glass that had been scattered across her bedroom. She laughed and puckered her lips again. With a smug confidence now, she blew a strong gust of wind that reshuffled the mess on her bedroom floor. Her closet door swung open violently and the down comforter flew off her bed. \u0026ldquo;Hahaha. Serena, you\u0026rsquo;re such a badass.\u0026rdquo; She wanted to get outside and put her new body to the test as soon as possible. Skipping briskly to her closet, she pulled out her blue Adidas track pants and matching zip-up sweatshirt. In an instant, she pulled them on over her thong \u0026amp; sports bra, and was out the door.\n... Stepping out onto the street, Serena was overwhelmed by the sights \u0026amp; sounds of the bustling city. Everything was so fresh and vibrant. She could clearly hear the details of hundreds of conversations - at the same time noticing the sound of leaves rustling, the roar of countless automobile engines, airplanes flying overhead, birds chirping\u0026hellip; it seemed like the whole world was an open book. The smell of exhaust and gasoline overwhelmed her for a moment before she consciously filtered it out\u0026hellip; choosing instead to notice the scent of fresh bread coming from the bakery across the street. She was astounded! Directional super-smell!? Unreal. She felt the wind whipping through her long hair, and the sunshine beating down on her face. It was like she\u0026rsquo;d previously lived her entire life inside a bag or under a sheet or something. EVERYTHING was sharper and more clear now. Her sight, her hearing, her sense of smell\u0026hellip; even her senses of taste and touch were improved. She felt the stretchy fabric pulling itself against her nipple and laughed\u0026hellip; yup, definitely her sense of touch had improved.\nShe was ecstatic. Overwhelmed. She knew she had to find somewhere that she could be alone - and fast! Serena again took a deep breath through her nose, filtering out the unwanted odors, and held it for a moment. Smiling, she turned down the sidewalk, and being sure no one was looking, let out a controlled blast of wind that blew a cloud of dust, trash, \u0026amp; fallen leaves billowing into the air. \u0026ldquo;Sooooooooo cool!\u0026rdquo; Feeling the rush of supercharged blood pumping through her veins, and watching the debris still floating in the wind, Serena felt like she could do anything. It was still morning, and there weren\u0026rsquo;t many people on the street\u0026hellip; still, she realized she\u0026rsquo;d have to go outside the city in order to get the privacy she needed. Out of habit, her mind started to recollect the city bus schedule when she stopped herself with a smile. Reaching up and pulling her long, silky hair back into a ponytail, she turned to face the street. \u0026ldquo;Wait a minute,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t need the bus anymore\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nLike a track runner before a race, Serena shook her arms and legs to limber up. \u0026ldquo;Okay,\u0026rdquo; she mumbled, \u0026ldquo;here comes super-power test number one. Hyperwoman has super-speed, so you should have super-speed.\u0026rdquo; Smiling, she kneeled down and put one leg behind her, placing both hands onto the sidewalk to simulate a sprinter\u0026rsquo;s starting block stance. She rose up into the ready position. \u0026ldquo;Well alright then Serena; let\u0026rsquo;s see just how fast you can go.\u0026rdquo;\nSerena quickly looked down at her legs in anticipation. This was it. She clenched her thighs and immediately felt a rush of super-energy inside them. This was going to work - she just knew it. Looking down the road, her eyes easily zoomed in to focus on the nearest freeway entrance. She quickly calculated the distance to herself - \u0026ldquo;Okay. About 2 or 3 miles to the freeway entrance and then another 10 miles or so to the river at the state park.\u0026rdquo; Serena tensed herself in anticipation. \u0026ldquo;Alright then. Here goes nothing\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nSerena pushed off with her right leg as hard as she could. Her heart boomed with energy and her leg responded in kind, rocketing her forward at an unbelievable velocity. It was at least two or three seconds before her left leg finally completed her first step, propelling her onward down the sidewalk. Almost instantly, she was at the freeway entrance, and with instinctive grace, she rounded the on-ramp and found herself blazing down the shoulder of the highway, a spray of loose rocks and asphalt in her wake. Her body jumped and ducked, maneuvering past unforeseen obstacles as though she had always known they were there. Then, almost as quickly as she had started, Serena found herself standing perfectly still on the shores of the County River. Her hair fell down across her shoulders and a cloud of dust and sand flew forward into the water. Her heart was beating like a hummingbird\u0026rsquo;s, but quickly slowed down, settling back into its regular rhythm almost instantly. She turned around and saw the skid marks her two heels had left in the sand behind her. That\u0026rsquo;s when it hit her\u0026hellip; she had covered over twelve miles in seconds. Seconds!\nShe looked down the shore of the river and laughed out loud. With a tiny hop, she pulled her arms back into an exaggerated runner’s stance before instantly speeding off down the beach. Bam! Suddenly she was standing about a mile downstream. Serena started laughing. This was just insane! Taking a deep breath, she blew as hard as she could - and an enormous spray rose up off the water. Unbelievable. She did it again\u0026hellip; making an even bigger wave, and caused it to crash into the trees on the other side of the half-mile wide stream. \u0026ldquo;WOW!!!!\u0026rdquo;\nSerena was getting more and more excited. Looking across to the opposite shore, her eyes zoomed in to focus on a small clearing in the distant trees. Without a second thought, she crouched down, flexed her densely packed quad and calf muscles, and leapt forward into the air. Serena\u0026rsquo;s supercharged legs launched her little body off the ground, and she rose into the sky. Twenty, thirty feet in the air she rose, her body hurtling forward as though catapulted from a slingshot. She spread her arms out to her sides like gliding bird and looked down to see the water flying by. As she approached the shore, Serena tucked her arms and knees, pulling a last-second flip before landing in an exaggerated crouch on the opposite shore. It took her a second to fully comprehend what she had just done, but slowly, she turned around to look back across the river.\nSerena laughed hysterically, overcome with joy at the amazing power she now possessed. She raised her arms out to her sides, her large breasts pressing out against her tracksuit, and posed like a champion gymnast after a dismount. \u0026ldquo;Ta da!!\u0026rdquo;\n... Serena was beside herself. She looked around with her super-vision and scanned the woods. Not a single person for miles. \u0026ldquo;Well, I guess you don\u0026rsquo;t need this anymore,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself as she unzipped her top, dropping it in a pile at her feet. Her large breasts puffed out the sides \u0026amp; top of her sports bra. \u0026ldquo;Or this,\u0026rdquo; she laughed, pulling the bra up \u0026amp; over her head in one swift motion. One more quick glance around, and her shoes, socks and pants followed suit. Soon she was almost completely nude, her red silk thong panties the only remaining clothes on her body.\n\nShe raised her arms up over her head, allowing her full breasts to bounce lightly on her chest. She could still feel the energy pulsing and flowing through her - just as powerfully as it had back at her apartment. Serena looked up at the sun and realized it hadn\u0026rsquo;t been more than five minutes since she first ingested the serum. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I made it all the way out to the state park so fast,\u0026rdquo; she said as she began strolling down the shore. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t get over how light her whole body felt. Of course, the feeling of her buoyant breasts still fascinated her, but she noticed her head, her arms - even her hips and legs all felt lighter. And it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just like she was stronger and carrying her own weight better\u0026hellip; it was like she actually weighted less now than she did before. How was that possible? With all the extra muscle \u0026amp; density she\u0026rsquo;d packed on, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t she weight more than before? Serena flexed her bicep and rubbed the hard mound with her other hand as she continued pacing down the beach. Lost in thought, concentrating on the changes in her body, Serena was suddenly snapped back to attention by the crunching \u0026amp; shattering of an empty beer bottle under her foot.\nThe sudden noise startled Serena, and her heart leapt into overdrive. Reflex kicked in, and she jumped back, looking down at the ground. It was as if the world had suddenly lapsed into slow motion, and as she hopped backwards, she saw tiny bits of glass scattering in different directions - many of them bouncing harmlessly away from the exposed skin on the underside of her feet. Soon, she landed back on the ground, her foot crunching a large peice of the bottle directly underneath. Stepping away, she raised her leg up and inspected the bottom - still expecting to see large cuts and gashes on her heel from the sharp glass. When she instead saw nothing but perfectly smooth skin, she immediately understood what had happened. The superpowers were all new to her\u0026hellip; but by now, she had no doubt that they were all hers. Of course broken glass wouldn\u0026rsquo;t cut her foot. She lifted her hands in front of her, staring at her palms incredulously. She was bulletproof. Just like Hyperwoman.\nSerena dropped her hands and blankly looked ahead. It was really true. She really had super powers. Focusing on a good-sized boulder (it must have been about 5x5 feet and almost perfectly round), she walked over to it and placed her hands on either side. The now familiar rush of energy flowed from her heart through her arms, back, and legs as she hunched over and began to stand up. \u0026ldquo;Mmmmmmmph,\u0026rdquo; she grunted as her body raised itself upright. Her eyes widened as she felt her slender fingers press themselves a few centimeters into the surface of the rock. For just a moment, it felt as heavy and immobile as it always would have, but then in an instant, she felt her arms surge with super-power, and her elbow bent slightly to pull the huge stone out of the earth. Serena grunted again as her body began fueling itself with strength. The rock grew lighter and lighter until, in a moment, she was able to straighten her knees, bend her arms, and lift the rock up to rest against her super-firm breasts. The feeling of raw strength and power was amazing. Serena allowed herself just an instant to appreciate the way her tits supported the multi-ton rock before repositioning her hands and hoisting it up and over her head.\nBits of dirt and earth fell down on her as she proudly held the enormous stone aloft. Her whole body - from her calves to her back to her forearms - was pulsing with inhuman power, and the feeling was almost sexual. Her breasts and crotch actually buzzed in rhythm with her heartbeat as the electric blood coursed through her veins. Serena looked up, as if to confirm with her eyes that she was really holding a frigging boulder over her head. She laughed, feeling her super tits once again bouncing weightlessly on her chest. Her arms were flexed and displayed awesome definition, but actually did not look large or out of place on her body the way they had when she flexed in front of her kitchen mirror. She was definitely still just as strong as she had felt then, though. It was as though her body had quickly gotten used to handling the giant weight, and had adapted so that it didn\u0026rsquo;t require as much muscle mass to do the heavy lifting.\nSerena was overcome with joy, and she brought the boulder down a bit - pressing it over her head a few times as though doing free-weight repetitions at the gym. Her strength was unbelievable. Every flex of her biceps, her triceps\u0026hellip; each clenching muscle brought with it an accompanying sensation of warmth. It was just too much. She felt her body rewarding itself with more and more strength each time she repeated her motion. Again and again, she lifted the rock until she felt that she had \u0026lsquo;maxxed out\u0026rsquo; - her short workout fully activating the serum inside her muscles.\nLaughing, Serena brought one arm down, now holding the big rock over her head with her right hand alone. She felt fantastic. Placing her free hand on her hip, Serena spread her legs slightly and stood once again in the superhero pose. The enormous rock dwarfed her tiny body, covering it in a dark shadow, but she held it over her head like it was made of paper-mache. \u0026ldquo;I could get used to this,\u0026rdquo; she said as she began pressing the rock up and down with her lone hand. It must have weighed 5 or 6 tons, but it was so easy! With a glint in her eye, Serena looked across the lake and cocked her arm. One quick motion and it was gone - she hurled the boulder as far as she could\u0026hellip; trying to see if she could actually clear the entire river with her mighty arm. Stunned, she watched as it flew higher and higher, continuing well past the opposite shoreline, until it fell into the forest about another mile or two inland.\n... Serena looked around. Her plan had worked. She just ran to the state park in under a minute, created a tidal wave with her breath, jumped across a 1,500 span of water, and then hurled an enormous boulder for miles. And she didn\u0026rsquo;t even feel tired! There was not a doubt in her mind anymore that she had all the powers of Hyperwoman. The super-senses and super-breath. The super-speed. The strength and invulnerability. She could probably do everything Hyperwoman could do\u0026hellip; Including flying\u0026hellip;\nSerena\u0026rsquo;s thoughts trailed off and she absently brought her hands up to her stomach, flexing her abdominal muscles. Pushing aside her breast, Serena inspected the hard cuts of muscle on her tiny stomach and waist. Her body was pumped up and the blood was flowing from all her recent exertions. She had grown even sleeker and more defined in the process, and Serena wished she had a mirror so she could look at herself again. She knew that the super-workout had only made her body even tighter \u0026amp; hotter. Lifting her hands to her head, she ran her fingers through her long hair, then traced a line softly down the middle of her chest with her fingers. This was all too much. She feared it was all a dream and that she would wake up soon.\nFlight. No one on Earth had any idea how Hyperwoman could fly without wings. Could she really fly on her own or was it some kind of technology in her costume? Everyone had a theory, but no one knew for sure. Serena started walking down the beach. Smiling, she reached down to pick up another large rock - this one about a quarter the size of the first. She put both hands underneath it and lifted, her powerful muscles picking it up without much effort at all. In fact, she noticed she had less trouble with the huge stone than she used to have taking out the garbage. She had no problems balancing herself despite the enormous weight. Serena moved it into one hand and held it out to her side with a fully extended arm. The stone seemed to grow even lighter; it was easy to balance - even at such an awkward angle. She casually flicked her wrist and tossed the rock over her head to catch it with her other hand. Finally, she brought it in front of her and, using her other hand, balanced it on her index finger alone. Not just one handed\u0026hellip; one fingered! Simply incredible. Serena then took the massive stone and spun it on her extended finger like a basketball! The rock remained balanced for a few seconds before toppling to the ground.\nWith a sinister smile, she looked at the rock and curled her fingers into a fist. \u0026ldquo;You are super strong, aren\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo; she asked rhetorically. Serena reached down and jabbed her fingers into the top of the rock, hoisting it from the ground like a bowling ball. In one motion, she tossed it fifteen feet straight up into the air, and cocked her fist as it began its descent. With perfect timing, Serena\u0026rsquo;s mighty punch shattered the stone into thousands of pieces. A loud boom and a cloud of black dust exploded on contact. Bits \u0026amp; pieces of rock flew in every direction - the main bulk of it still remaining intact, but flying off to splash downstream. Serena looked at her hand and was glad to see she remained perfectly flawless and uninjured. She felt like she could do anything.\nLooking up into the air, Serena just knew in her heart that she could fly. She just knew it. But how? She thought back to her run-in with Jennifer Benson in the apartment locker room. After she had transformed into Hyperwoman, she just kind of flexed her calves and floated away. Serena already knew that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a matter of just jumping really high\u0026hellip; she had already tried the jumping thing earlier, and Hyperwoman didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to need any kind of exaggerated motion to lift off the ground. So there had to be some kind of trick to it.\nWith perfect recall, Serena copied the pose that Hyperwoman had stood in before she lifted off. As she arched her back and stuck her butt out, Serena felt a burning energy start to build in her chest. \u0026ldquo;This is it, I know it\u0026rdquo; she said aloud as the feeling quickly spread inside her body. Her chest began to tingle and her nipples puffed out slightly, pulling her breasts up and away from her ribcage. It was an incredible feeling, and Serena was shocked at how she intuitively knew how to access it. The sensation spread down through her feet and hands as she raised her arms out to her sides. Looking skyward, Serena felt the energy building in each breast \u0026ndash; her body becoming completely full with the signature tingle of her superpowers. She grew lighter and lighter, and as she flexed her claves and brought her arms completely out to her sides, Serena simply willed her body off the ground.\nIt was like nothing she\u0026rsquo;d ever experienced as Serena lifted up onto her toes and slowly freed herself from the constraints of gravity. She felt her body become as light as a feather, and inch by inch she rose into the air. She started to laugh again. It was really happening! She was leaving the ground! Serena quickly became accustomed to the strange sensation of being weightless, and she tensed her calves again to propel herself into the air. Even though she had never flown before, the movements were so intuitive. Of course she could fly. How could she have ever doubted it?\nSerena raised her hands above her head, accelerating her ascent with a tight clench of her fists. Higher and higher she climbed - releasing her hands and stopping gracefully to hover about twenty feet above the treetops. The wind whipped her hair out of its ponytail as she did a few mid-air pirouettes. Flying was so easy! With a quick flex of her thighs, Serena shot up into the clouds, twisting her body this way and that as she tested the limits of her mobility. It was incredible. She was already an expert in the skies. She did a few loops and barrel rolls before pointing her body horizontally and shooting off into the distance as fast as she could. The sonic boom was audible for miles.\nLike a bolt of lightning, Serena found herself speeding across the landscape. She must have been going 2 or 3 times the speed of sound and she wasn\u0026rsquo;t even really trying yet! The tingling feeling grew more intense, and she clenched her muscles harder to increase her velocity. More sonic booms, and her speed multiplied. The ground was now just a blur. She arched her back to gradually point herself skyward, and was soon rocketing vertically into the stratosphere. The ground was retreating further and further into the distance. Serena rose fifteen or twenty miles into the sky before finally slowing to a halt. Neither the freezing cold air nor the relative lack of oxygen caused her any discomfort whatsoever. It was crazy - her body really was completely impervious to harm.\nSerena finally let her muscles relax, and slowly her almost weightless body came to a complete stop. The Sun burned brightly, but she was high enough now to see the stars and moon behind her. She used her super-vision to look down and examine the landscape. Thousands of people packed into the city and its surrounding communities. All of them just going about their daily routines. Just yesterday, she had been one of those normal people. No longer. Serena lifted her hands in front of her and looked at them. \u0026ldquo;So much power now,\u0026rdquo; she said as she examined herself. Straightening her arms and clenching her fists, hard cuts of super powerful muscles revealed themselves beneath her skin. \u0026ldquo;So much power.\u0026rdquo;\nIt was at that moment that everything began to sink in. She had done it. She had actually given herself super powers. She was so much more than human now. Serena spun around a few times, reveling in her mastery over gravity. \u0026ldquo;I really can do anything I want,\u0026rdquo; she said matter-of-factly. \u0026ldquo;But what?\u0026rdquo;\nSerena used her super-vision to zoom in on the lake shore in the state park. Quickly locating her discarded clothing, she turned her body around and flexed all her muscles at once. With another sonic boom, she rocketed back to earth, slowing down at the last moment to perform a perfectly graceful landing right next to her pile of clothes. She quickly pulled them on and tensed her thighs to rise into the air again. It hadn\u0026rsquo;t taken more than a half hour, but already Serena was convinced of her complete mastery of her powers.\nAs she lifted skyward, Serena took a moment to collect her thoughts. In the last half hour, she had taken all of her life\u0026rsquo;s priorities and scrambled them like an egg. No longer would she spend her time thinking about grad school or the dating scene. Her problems with her job and her family were so inconsequential. She was a completely new person now \u0026ndash; a superpowered goddess! Serena floated into the clouds and made her way leisurely back to the city. Her head was spinning, but she had never felt this good in her life. As she soared gleefully through the sky, Serena realized she could do anything she wanted. The only problem now would be figuring out exactly what she wanted to do.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/2021/02/serenas-lucky-day-02/","tags":["superstrength","transformation","flying"],"title":"Serenas Lucky Day Part 2"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"A regular girl discovers the secret of the world\u0026rsquo;s mightiest superheroine\n:: DAY II continued :: Serena stood up straight with both arms hanging loosely at her sides. Her body was completely nude \u0026ndash; and completely flawless. There was not a single blemish or stretch mark to be found on her tanned flesh, and her proportions were something out of a comic book. She tilted her head back, taking a deep breath and allowing her large, firm breasts to rise higher on her chest. Exhaling strongly, Serena was amazed when the video camera \u0026amp; all the papers on the kitchen table suddenly went flying - scattering themselves across the room. \u0026ldquo;What the\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she wondered aloud, quickly realizing that it had been her breath - the air from her lungs - that had blown the contents of the room around.\n\u0026ldquo;No way,\u0026rdquo; she said \u0026ldquo;can I really do that!?\u0026rdquo; She walked over to the video camera and picked it up off the ground. Good, it hadn\u0026rsquo;t been damaged. Placing it back on the table, Serena couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but turn around one more time to check herself out in the mirror. Her ass was fantastic. She stuck her butt out and put her palm squarely on the tight flesh that connected it to the small of her back. With a quick flex of her thigh, all the muscles on her leg carved themselves into tightly defined bunches. Her perky behind gripped itself tightly, and Serena allowed her fingers to trace the striations through her super-tight skin. Simply amazing. Her body was hard and strong like a marble statue, but her shape was delicate and feminine. Serena relaxed her leg and turned back around to face the camera, the feeling of her large breasts bobbing up and down causing her to laugh with self-satisfaction. \u0026ldquo;Okay,\u0026rdquo; she said as turned to face the other side of the room, \u0026ldquo;here goes nothing.\u0026rdquo;\nSerena looked intently at the bag of dirty clothes that she had gathered by her bedroom door. \u0026ldquo;Okay that\u0026rsquo;s got to be at least 15 or 20 feet away from me, right?\u0026rdquo; she said to the camera. \u0026ldquo;Now let me see if I can just\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nShe took a deep breath, filling her lungs with air, and then exhaled with all her might. She was instantly rewarded by the unfamiliar feeling of hurricane force winds escaping from between her tightly pursed lips. The bag of clothes leapt off the ground, and Serena watched in amazement as it lifted up to fly straight into her dresser. The bag burst on impact, sending shirts and socks flying every which way. Cosmetics and accessories spilled across the floor, and her framed pictures all fell from the wall, shattering on the floor.\nSerena instinctively raised her hands to her ears and squinted at the cacophony - caught off guard yet again by the incredible clarity of sound she was able to perceive. \u0026ldquo;Seven hundred and thirty six,\u0026rdquo; she said nonchalantly, before realizing that she had subconsciously counted the pieces of glass as they fell to the floor. She dropped her hands back to her sides and repeated the number. \u0026ldquo;Seven hundred and thirty six.\u0026rdquo; She shook her head. \u0026ldquo;Seven thirty six.\u0026rdquo; Serena looked at the pile on the ground and was amazed as her eyes focused in - darting quickly from piece to piece - her mind easily taking note of which ones she had seen yet and which ones she had not. No more than three seconds later, her superhuman eyes had confirmed what her superhuman ears just told her. 736 pieces of broken glass. Not a doubt in her mind. \u0026ldquo;No way,\u0026rdquo; she breathed. \u0026ldquo;No fucking way.\u0026rdquo;\nSerena ran to the window and looked down at the roadway. \u0026ldquo;One twenty two,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself, then quickly counted the number of cars parked along the street. She was spot-on. \u0026ldquo;No way no way no way!\u0026rdquo; She looked at the tree across the street. \u0026ldquo;Thirteen thousand four hundred and ten,\u0026rdquo; she said confidently as she instantly counted the number of leaves on its branches. Serena laughed hysterically. \u0026ldquo;My brain! Even my brain is super!\u0026rdquo;\nShe ran over to her bookshelf and pulled a few titles down. \u0026ldquo;Moby Dick,\u0026rdquo; she noted, \u0026ldquo;I had always meant to read that.\u0026rdquo; Opening the cover, Serena smiled as she instantly digested the contents. Page by page she flipped through with increasing speed until she finally just held the book between her thumb and forefinger, and flipped through as though shuffling a deck of cards. Even at that speed, Serena didn\u0026rsquo;t miss a word, and was shocked to discover she fully comprehended every nuance of the entire novel. \u0026ldquo;Not only am I strong, but super-smart too! This is awesome!\u0026rdquo;\nSerena was beside herself. \u0026ldquo;Okokokokok, you need to slow down and THINK, girl! First: you need to get out of this house before you tear it down! Second: you need to go somewhere quiet and secluded, and put yourself through some tests. Third: you need to think about what you\u0026rsquo;re going to do with these powers once you\u0026rsquo;ve got \u0026lsquo;em under control.\u0026rdquo;\nSerena turned back to the mirror - still overcome with pride in her new \u0026amp; improved body. \u0026ldquo;Have no fear, Serena is here,\u0026rdquo; she laughed to herself as she put her hands on her hips. Now that was more like it! Her super tight muscles glistened in the light of the room as her large breasts heaved in steady rhythm with her breathing. Her flawless face and flowing hair were the epitome of female perfection. Her legs went on for miles. \u0026ldquo;God damn, Serena - LOOK at you!\u0026rdquo; She raised herself up onto one toe and twirled around a half-dozen times before gracefully settling back down on her heels in the exact same position. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re fucking perfect!\u0026rdquo;\nDeciding she needed to get out of her house, Serena walked back into her room to find something to wear. Every single motion was graceful and perfectly efficient as she made her way over to the dresser. \u0026ldquo;What to wear, what to wear,\u0026rdquo; she mused as she lifted out her favorite \u0026lsquo;special\u0026rsquo; pair of red silk thong panties. Sliding them up her legs, she moved on to pick up shirt after shirt\u0026hellip; all of them having been tailored and stretched to fit a girl with much smaller boobs and a much bigger belly. The only articles that looked like they would fit were some pullover sweatshirts, and there was no way Serena was going to bury herself in one of those now. Eventually getting frustrated, Serena walked back over and picked her sportsbra off the ground, holding it up by the tag. \u0026ldquo;34A\u0026rdquo; she read aloud, and smiled from ear to ear as she walked back to the mirror, twirling the bra around her fingers.\nSerena faced her reflection, still overcome by the sight of her new super-petite body. She turned to the side and took in the incredible view of her large breasts as they jutted out of her profile. God, they were gigantic! And so firm and bouncy. Turning back straight ahead, Serena put both her arms out to the sides \u0026amp; rocked up and down on her heels. She watched in delight as her pendulous breasts swayed back and forth before eventually settling back into position. She reached her hand over and placed it in squarely between her tits, feeling their fullness as they surrounded her fingers. She then brought her arms forward and watched as her cleavage almost completely swallowed her hand. Serena\u0026rsquo;s fingertips poked out the top, but otherwise, her hand had been completely covered by the flesh of her brand new tits. She laughed absently as she pulled her hand out from between her breasts, causing them to jiggle for a moment before once again standing up at attention.\nWith one quick motion, Serena reached down to take her bra in both hands. She brought it up over her head and dropped it loosely over her shoulders. Tugging with both hands, she stretched the fabric out almost to the breaking point before pulling it down to stretch across her buoyant tits. God, they looked so good! She hooked her thumbs under the fabric for a second before letting it go, and was delighted by the way her firm chest prevented the flat-cupped top from reaching back to her ribcage. The black lycra fabric strained in protest as the underside of Serena\u0026rsquo;s new breasts stuck visibly out the bottom. \u0026ldquo;Aww\u0026hellip; what\u0026rsquo;s the matter, Serena,\u0026rdquo; she mock pouted, \u0026ldquo;can\u0026rsquo;t find anything big enough to hold back your super boobs?\u0026rdquo; She thought back to her experiences in high school and junior high school - when she\u0026rsquo;d felt totally ostracized because of her weight problem and lack of \u0026lsquo;frontal development.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Well who\u0026rsquo;s laughing now,\u0026rdquo; she purred confidently.\nSerena put her hands on her hips and puffed out her chest even further. Her enhanced hearing picked up the sound of hundreds of tiny threads ripping as her breasts inflated slightly in time with her breathing. It was amazing the way they puffed out the top and bottom, her cleavage going on for days thanks to the too-small bra that now pressed her tits into one another. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t get over the way they stood out and made her hips look so small. She flexed her abdominals and one by one, they stood out in bold relief underneath her tanned skin. Relaxing again, Serena\u0026rsquo;s muscles slimmed down, and her body reduced its bulk to once again become incredibly lithe and petite. It was mind-boggling. How could her body change from super-cut to baby-soft so quickly? She took her hands off her hips and put them on her knees. Bending over and thrusting her chest and tits out, Serena simulated a pose she\u0026rsquo;d seen recently in a Playboy spread. She had to laugh\u0026hellip; she really looked just too damn hot for her own good.\nSerena stood back up and shook her head. \u0026ldquo;Snap out of it,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself, \u0026ldquo;you look fantastic, but there\u0026rsquo;s so much more to it than that!\u0026rdquo; She looked over at the dirty clothes and broken glass that had been scattered across her bedroom. She laughed and puckered her lips again. With a smug confidence now, she blew a strong gust of wind that reshuffled the mess on her bedroom floor. Her closet door swung open violently and the down comforter flew off her bed. \u0026ldquo;Hahaha. Serena, you\u0026rsquo;re such a badass.\u0026rdquo; She wanted to get outside and put her new body to the test as soon as possible. Skipping briskly to her closet, she pulled out her blue Adidas track pants and matching zip-up sweatshirt. In an instant, she pulled them on over her thong \u0026amp; sports bra, and was out the door.\n... Stepping out onto the street, Serena was overwhelmed by the sights \u0026amp; sounds of the bustling city. Everything was so fresh and vibrant. She could clearly hear the details of hundreds of conversations - at the same time noticing the sound of leaves rustling, the roar of countless automobile engines, airplanes flying overhead, birds chirping\u0026hellip; it seemed like the whole world was an open book. The smell of exhaust and gasoline overwhelmed her for a moment before she consciously filtered it out\u0026hellip; choosing instead to notice the scent of fresh bread coming from the bakery across the street. She was astounded! Directional super-smell!? Unreal. She felt the wind whipping through her long hair, and the sunshine beating down on her face. It was like she\u0026rsquo;d previously lived her entire life inside a bag or under a sheet or something. EVERYTHING was sharper and more clear now. Her sight, her hearing, her sense of smell\u0026hellip; even her senses of taste and touch were improved. She felt the stretchy fabric pulling itself against her nipple and laughed\u0026hellip; yup, definitely her sense of touch had improved.\nShe was ecstatic. Overwhelmed. She knew she had to find somewhere that she could be alone - and fast! Serena again took a deep breath through her nose, filtering out the unwanted odors, and held it for a moment. Smiling, she turned down the sidewalk, and being sure no one was looking, let out a controlled blast of wind that blew a cloud of dust, trash, \u0026amp; fallen leaves billowing into the air. \u0026ldquo;Sooooooooo cool!\u0026rdquo; Feeling the rush of supercharged blood pumping through her veins, and watching the debris still floating in the wind, Serena felt like she could do anything. It was still morning, and there weren\u0026rsquo;t many people on the street\u0026hellip; still, she realized she\u0026rsquo;d have to go outside the city in order to get the privacy she needed. Out of habit, her mind started to recollect the city bus schedule when she stopped herself with a smile. Reaching up and pulling her long, silky hair back into a ponytail, she turned to face the street. \u0026ldquo;Wait a minute,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t need the bus anymore\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nLike a track runner before a race, Serena shook her arms and legs to limber up. \u0026ldquo;Okay,\u0026rdquo; she mumbled, \u0026ldquo;here comes super-power test number one. Hyperwoman has super-speed, so you should have super-speed.\u0026rdquo; Smiling, she kneeled down and put one leg behind her, placing both hands onto the sidewalk to simulate a sprinter\u0026rsquo;s starting block stance. She rose up into the ready position. \u0026ldquo;Well alright then Serena; let\u0026rsquo;s see just how fast you can go.\u0026rdquo;\nSerena quickly looked down at her legs in anticipation. This was it. She clenched her thighs and immediately felt a rush of super-energy inside them. This was going to work - she just knew it. Looking down the road, her eyes easily zoomed in to focus on the nearest freeway entrance. She quickly calculated the distance to herself - \u0026ldquo;Okay. About 2 or 3 miles to the freeway entrance and then another 10 miles or so to the river at the state park.\u0026rdquo; Serena tensed herself in anticipation. \u0026ldquo;Alright then. Here goes nothing\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nSerena pushed off with her right leg as hard as she could. Her heart boomed with energy and her leg responded in kind, rocketing her forward at an unbelievable velocity. It was at least two or three seconds before her left leg finally completed her first step, propelling her onward down the sidewalk. Almost instantly, she was at the freeway entrance, and with instinctive grace, she rounded the on-ramp and found herself blazing down the shoulder of the highway, a spray of loose rocks and asphalt in her wake. Her body jumped and ducked, maneuvering past unforeseen obstacles as though she had always known they were there. Then, almost as quickly as she had started, Serena found herself standing perfectly still on the shores of the County River. Her hair fell down across her shoulders and a cloud of dust and sand flew forward into the water. Her heart was beating like a hummingbird\u0026rsquo;s, but quickly slowed down, settling back into its regular rhythm almost instantly. She turned around and saw the skid marks her two heels had left in the sand behind her. That\u0026rsquo;s when it hit her\u0026hellip; she had covered over twelve miles in seconds. Seconds!\nShe looked down the shore of the river and laughed out loud. With a tiny hop, she pulled her arms back into an exaggerated runner’s stance before instantly speeding off down the beach. Bam! Suddenly she was standing about a mile downstream. Serena started laughing. This was just insane! Taking a deep breath, she blew as hard as she could - and an enormous spray rose up off the water. Unbelievable. She did it again\u0026hellip; making an even bigger wave, and caused it to crash into the trees on the other side of the half-mile wide stream. \u0026ldquo;WOW!!!!\u0026rdquo;\nSerena was getting more and more excited. Looking across to the opposite shore, her eyes zoomed in to focus on a small clearing in the distant trees. Without a second thought, she crouched down, flexed her densely packed quad and calf muscles, and leapt forward into the air. Serena\u0026rsquo;s supercharged legs launched her little body off the ground, and she rose into the sky. Twenty, thirty feet in the air she rose, her body hurtling forward as though catapulted from a slingshot. She spread her arms out to her sides like gliding bird and looked down to see the water flying by. As she approached the shore, Serena tucked her arms and knees, pulling a last-second flip before landing in an exaggerated crouch on the opposite shore. It took her a second to fully comprehend what she had just done, but slowly, she turned around to look back across the river.\nSerena laughed hysterically, overcome with joy at the amazing power she now possessed. She raised her arms out to her sides, her large breasts pressing out against her tracksuit, and posed like a champion gymnast after a dismount. \u0026ldquo;Ta da!!\u0026rdquo;\n... Serena was beside herself. She looked around with her super-vision and scanned the woods. Not a single person for miles. \u0026ldquo;Well, I guess you don\u0026rsquo;t need this anymore,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself as she unzipped her top, dropping it in a pile at her feet. Her large breasts puffed out the sides \u0026amp; top of her sports bra. \u0026ldquo;Or this,\u0026rdquo; she laughed, pulling the bra up \u0026amp; over her head in one swift motion. One more quick glance around, and her shoes, socks and pants followed suit. Soon she was almost completely nude, her red silk thong panties the only remaining clothes on her body.\n\nShe raised her arms up over her head, allowing her full breasts to bounce lightly on her chest. She could still feel the energy pulsing and flowing through her - just as powerfully as it had back at her apartment. Serena looked up at the sun and realized it hadn\u0026rsquo;t been more than five minutes since she first ingested the serum. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I made it all the way out to the state park so fast,\u0026rdquo; she said as she began strolling down the shore. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t get over how light her whole body felt. Of course, the feeling of her buoyant breasts still fascinated her, but she noticed her head, her arms - even her hips and legs all felt lighter. And it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just like she was stronger and carrying her own weight better\u0026hellip; it was like she actually weighted less now than she did before. How was that possible? With all the extra muscle \u0026amp; density she\u0026rsquo;d packed on, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t she weight more than before? Serena flexed her bicep and rubbed the hard mound with her other hand as she continued pacing down the beach. Lost in thought, concentrating on the changes in her body, Serena was suddenly snapped back to attention by the crunching \u0026amp; shattering of an empty beer bottle under her foot.\nThe sudden noise startled Serena, and her heart leapt into overdrive. Reflex kicked in, and she jumped back, looking down at the ground. It was as if the world had suddenly lapsed into slow motion, and as she hopped backwards, she saw tiny bits of glass scattering in different directions - many of them bouncing harmlessly away from the exposed skin on the underside of her feet. Soon, she landed back on the ground, her foot crunching a large peice of the bottle directly underneath. Stepping away, she raised her leg up and inspected the bottom - still expecting to see large cuts and gashes on her heel from the sharp glass. When she instead saw nothing but perfectly smooth skin, she immediately understood what had happened. The superpowers were all new to her\u0026hellip; but by now, she had no doubt that they were all hers. Of course broken glass wouldn\u0026rsquo;t cut her foot. She lifted her hands in front of her, staring at her palms incredulously. She was bulletproof. Just like Hyperwoman.\nSerena dropped her hands and blankly looked ahead. It was really true. She really had super powers. Focusing on a good-sized boulder (it must have been about 5x5 feet and almost perfectly round), she walked over to it and placed her hands on either side. The now familiar rush of energy flowed from her heart through her arms, back, and legs as she hunched over and began to stand up. \u0026ldquo;Mmmmmmmph,\u0026rdquo; she grunted as her body raised itself upright. Her eyes widened as she felt her slender fingers press themselves a few centimeters into the surface of the rock. For just a moment, it felt as heavy and immobile as it always would have, but then in an instant, she felt her arms surge with super-power, and her elbow bent slightly to pull the huge stone out of the earth. Serena grunted again as her body began fueling itself with strength. The rock grew lighter and lighter until, in a moment, she was able to straighten her knees, bend her arms, and lift the rock up to rest against her super-firm breasts. The feeling of raw strength and power was amazing. Serena allowed herself just an instant to appreciate the way her tits supported the multi-ton rock before repositioning her hands and hoisting it up and over her head.\nBits of dirt and earth fell down on her as she proudly held the enormous stone aloft. Her whole body - from her calves to her back to her forearms - was pulsing with inhuman power, and the feeling was almost sexual. Her breasts and crotch actually buzzed in rhythm with her heartbeat as the electric blood coursed through her veins. Serena looked up, as if to confirm with her eyes that she was really holding a frigging boulder over her head. She laughed, feeling her super tits once again bouncing weightlessly on her chest. Her arms were flexed and displayed awesome definition, but actually did not look large or out of place on her body the way they had when she flexed in front of her kitchen mirror. She was definitely still just as strong as she had felt then, though. It was as though her body had quickly gotten used to handling the giant weight, and had adapted so that it didn\u0026rsquo;t require as much muscle mass to do the heavy lifting.\nSerena was overcome with joy, and she brought the boulder down a bit - pressing it over her head a few times as though doing free-weight repetitions at the gym. Her strength was unbelievable. Every flex of her biceps, her triceps\u0026hellip; each clenching muscle brought with it an accompanying sensation of warmth. It was just too much. She felt her body rewarding itself with more and more strength each time she repeated her motion. Again and again, she lifted the rock until she felt that she had \u0026lsquo;maxxed out\u0026rsquo; - her short workout fully activating the serum inside her muscles.\nLaughing, Serena brought one arm down, now holding the big rock over her head with her right hand alone. She felt fantastic. Placing her free hand on her hip, Serena spread her legs slightly and stood once again in the superhero pose. The enormous rock dwarfed her tiny body, covering it in a dark shadow, but she held it over her head like it was made of paper-mache. \u0026ldquo;I could get used to this,\u0026rdquo; she said as she began pressing the rock up and down with her lone hand. It must have weighed 5 or 6 tons, but it was so easy! With a glint in her eye, Serena looked across the lake and cocked her arm. One quick motion and it was gone - she hurled the boulder as far as she could\u0026hellip; trying to see if she could actually clear the entire river with her mighty arm. Stunned, she watched as it flew higher and higher, continuing well past the opposite shoreline, until it fell into the forest about another mile or two inland.\n... Serena looked around. Her plan had worked. She just ran to the state park in under a minute, created a tidal wave with her breath, jumped across a 1,500 span of water, and then hurled an enormous boulder for miles. And she didn\u0026rsquo;t even feel tired! There was not a doubt in her mind anymore that she had all the powers of Hyperwoman. The super-senses and super-breath. The super-speed. The strength and invulnerability. She could probably do everything Hyperwoman could do\u0026hellip; Including flying\u0026hellip;\nSerena\u0026rsquo;s thoughts trailed off and she absently brought her hands up to her stomach, flexing her abdominal muscles. Pushing aside her breast, Serena inspected the hard cuts of muscle on her tiny stomach and waist. Her body was pumped up and the blood was flowing from all her recent exertions. She had grown even sleeker and more defined in the process, and Serena wished she had a mirror so she could look at herself again. She knew that the super-workout had only made her body even tighter \u0026amp; hotter. Lifting her hands to her head, she ran her fingers through her long hair, then traced a line softly down the middle of her chest with her fingers. This was all too much. She feared it was all a dream and that she would wake up soon.\nFlight. No one on Earth had any idea how Hyperwoman could fly without wings. Could she really fly on her own or was it some kind of technology in her costume? Everyone had a theory, but no one knew for sure. Serena started walking down the beach. Smiling, she reached down to pick up another large rock - this one about a quarter the size of the first. She put both hands underneath it and lifted, her powerful muscles picking it up without much effort at all. In fact, she noticed she had less trouble with the huge stone than she used to have taking out the garbage. She had no problems balancing herself despite the enormous weight. Serena moved it into one hand and held it out to her side with a fully extended arm. The stone seemed to grow even lighter; it was easy to balance - even at such an awkward angle. She casually flicked her wrist and tossed the rock over her head to catch it with her other hand. Finally, she brought it in front of her and, using her other hand, balanced it on her index finger alone. Not just one handed\u0026hellip; one fingered! Simply incredible. Serena then took the massive stone and spun it on her extended finger like a basketball! The rock remained balanced for a few seconds before toppling to the ground.\nWith a sinister smile, she looked at the rock and curled her fingers into a fist. \u0026ldquo;You are super strong, aren\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo; she asked rhetorically. Serena reached down and jabbed her fingers into the top of the rock, hoisting it from the ground like a bowling ball. In one motion, she tossed it fifteen feet straight up into the air, and cocked her fist as it began its descent. With perfect timing, Serena\u0026rsquo;s mighty punch shattered the stone into thousands of pieces. A loud boom and a cloud of black dust exploded on contact. Bits \u0026amp; pieces of rock flew in every direction - the main bulk of it still remaining intact, but flying off to splash downstream. Serena looked at her hand and was glad to see she remained perfectly flawless and uninjured. She felt like she could do anything.\nLooking up into the air, Serena just knew in her heart that she could fly. She just knew it. But how? She thought back to her run-in with Jennifer Benson in the apartment locker room. After she had transformed into Hyperwoman, she just kind of flexed her calves and floated away. Serena already knew that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a matter of just jumping really high\u0026hellip; she had already tried the jumping thing earlier, and Hyperwoman didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to need any kind of exaggerated motion to lift off the ground. So there had to be some kind of trick to it.\nWith perfect recall, Serena copied the pose that Hyperwoman had stood in before she lifted off. As she arched her back and stuck her butt out, Serena felt a burning energy start to build in her chest. \u0026ldquo;This is it, I know it\u0026rdquo; she said aloud as the feeling quickly spread inside her body. Her chest began to tingle and her nipples puffed out slightly, pulling her breasts up and away from her ribcage. It was an incredible feeling, and Serena was shocked at how she intuitively knew how to access it. The sensation spread down through her feet and hands as she raised her arms out to her sides. Looking skyward, Serena felt the energy building in each breast \u0026ndash; her body becoming completely full with the signature tingle of her superpowers. She grew lighter and lighter, and as she flexed her claves and brought her arms completely out to her sides, Serena simply willed her body off the ground.\nIt was like nothing she\u0026rsquo;d ever experienced as Serena lifted up onto her toes and slowly freed herself from the constraints of gravity. She felt her body become as light as a feather, and inch by inch she rose into the air. She started to laugh again. It was really happening! She was leaving the ground! Serena quickly became accustomed to the strange sensation of being weightless, and she tensed her calves again to propel herself into the air. Even though she had never flown before, the movements were so intuitive. Of course she could fly. How could she have ever doubted it?\nSerena raised her hands above her head, accelerating her ascent with a tight clench of her fists. Higher and higher she climbed - releasing her hands and stopping gracefully to hover about twenty feet above the treetops. The wind whipped her hair out of its ponytail as she did a few mid-air pirouettes. Flying was so easy! With a quick flex of her thighs, Serena shot up into the clouds, twisting her body this way and that as she tested the limits of her mobility. It was incredible. She was already an expert in the skies. She did a few loops and barrel rolls before pointing her body horizontally and shooting off into the distance as fast as she could. The sonic boom was audible for miles.\nLike a bolt of lightning, Serena found herself speeding across the landscape. She must have been going 2 or 3 times the speed of sound and she wasn\u0026rsquo;t even really trying yet! The tingling feeling grew more intense, and she clenched her muscles harder to increase her velocity. More sonic booms, and her speed multiplied. The ground was now just a blur. She arched her back to gradually point herself skyward, and was soon rocketing vertically into the stratosphere. The ground was retreating further and further into the distance. Serena rose fifteen or twenty miles into the sky before finally slowing to a halt. Neither the freezing cold air nor the relative lack of oxygen caused her any discomfort whatsoever. It was crazy - her body really was completely impervious to harm.\nSerena finally let her muscles relax, and slowly her almost weightless body came to a complete stop. The Sun burned brightly, but she was high enough now to see the stars and moon behind her. She used her super-vision to look down and examine the landscape. Thousands of people packed into the city and its surrounding communities. All of them just going about their daily routines. Just yesterday, she had been one of those normal people. No longer. Serena lifted her hands in front of her and looked at them. \u0026ldquo;So much power now,\u0026rdquo; she said as she examined herself. Straightening her arms and clenching her fists, hard cuts of super powerful muscles revealed themselves beneath her skin. \u0026ldquo;So much power.\u0026rdquo;\nIt was at that moment that everything began to sink in. She had done it. She had actually given herself super powers. She was so much more than human now. Serena spun around a few times, reveling in her mastery over gravity. \u0026ldquo;I really can do anything I want,\u0026rdquo; she said matter-of-factly. \u0026ldquo;But what?\u0026rdquo;\nSerena used her super-vision to zoom in on the lake shore in the state park. Quickly locating her discarded clothing, she turned her body around and flexed all her muscles at once. With another sonic boom, she rocketed back to earth, slowing down at the last moment to perform a perfectly graceful landing right next to her pile of clothes. She quickly pulled them on and tensed her thighs to rise into the air again. It hadn\u0026rsquo;t taken more than a half hour, but already Serena was convinced of her complete mastery of her powers.\nAs she lifted skyward, Serena took a moment to collect her thoughts. In the last half hour, she had taken all of her life\u0026rsquo;s priorities and scrambled them like an egg. No longer would she spend her time thinking about grad school or the dating scene. Her problems with her job and her family were so inconsequential. She was a completely new person now \u0026ndash; a superpowered goddess! Serena floated into the clouds and made her way leisurely back to the city. Her head was spinning, but she had never felt this good in her life. As she soared gleefully through the sky, Serena realized she could do anything she wanted. The only problem now would be figuring out exactly what she wanted to do.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/2021/02/serenas-lucky-day-03/","tags":["superstrength","transformation","flying"],"title":"Serenas Lucky Day Part 3"},{"categories":["Arch Linux"],"contents":"V tomto článku vám ukážu jak nainstalovat Arch Linux.\nVarování !

None of the changes are \u0026ldquo;earth shattering,\u0026rdquo; but hopefully most of the typos, grammar mistakes, timeline errors, and implausible or unexplained science has been corrected.\n01 - Changes in Paradise \u0026ldquo;Damn it\u0026rsquo;s hot,\u0026rdquo; Patrick said to no one in particular.\nHe stretched out his back, stiff from bending over the mess of electronic parts spread out on the tarp in front of him. He was trying to repair a small, short wave radio that had unexpectedly been damaged. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much in the way of spare parts, and so Pat was trying to modify existing parts and materials. It was difficult, slow work, and he really didn\u0026rsquo;t think he\u0026rsquo;d be able to fix it in the first place. But he had to try, the boat had been modified, or scavenged as the case may be, to serve as a power plant for the jungle laboratory he and John had set up. It would be impossible to restore it to a seaworthy condition, so the radio was the only hope of rescue. They had found all the evidence they needed to help Green Peace file a lawsuit on behalf of the aboriginal natives that had originally lived on the island, and now it was time to be rescued. Or at least, that was the original plan.\nIt had been two months since Pat and his old friend John had bought a small boat and secretly landed on the small, uncharted island northwest of Australia. Nuclear tests had been conducted near the island, and he and John were there, trying to document the damages that had been done. They hadn\u0026rsquo;t been supported by any government agency, and they had even been denied permission to go. A few bribes in the right places, however, and they found themselves living in paradise.\nPat had been trying to fix the radio for several days, and he was becoming more and more sure that it was useless. He took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes in frustration. He looked around for a bit of cloth to clean his lenses, and couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a clean one, their clothes had slowly disintegrated in the tropical heat. He and John had taken to wearing only their nylon swimsuits to cope with the weather, and as a result both had become golden brown from head to toe. He set his glasses aside and returned to his task.\nHe tried one more time to attach his jury-rigged transistor to the power cell and got the odd mixture of tree sap, metal filings, and ocean brine to hold the wire in place. Very carefully he switched on the power and waited for the familiar cackle that would indicate he had fixed the radio.\nNothing. Not even a blip. Then, a sudden crackle! No, that was someone coming up the path. Damn, and double damn, thought Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;John,\u0026rdquo; he called out towards the path from beach where his friend was returning from trying to spear dinner. \u0026ldquo;John, it looks like I\u0026rsquo;m just not technician enough to fix the damn radio.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s o.k. buddy, you\u0026rsquo;re a molecular biologist, not an electronic engineer,\u0026rdquo; John smiled as he trotted back to the small lab with a flounder firmly skewered on his homemade spear. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll be eating just fine tonight! We can worry about being rescued when I\u0026rsquo;m too old to fish,\u0026rdquo; he joked.\nPat smiled wanly at John\u0026rsquo;s joke. \u0026ldquo;Yea, but Green Peace will never be able to file that lawsuit without this evidence.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn nodded thoughtfully. \u0026ldquo;Well, there\u0026rsquo;s not much we can do about it, is there. We cannibalized the boat so we could build the lab and the beach hut, and we planned on using the short wave to let somebody know we were here to be rescued. How could we know that a tsunami would rush up on the first hut we built and ruin our radio?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, we\u0026rsquo;re lucky that we decided to build the bio lab at least 200 feet higher up the side of the volcano than the other one, even though it was a pain to haul all the pieces of the boat up here. And the geothermal energy that powers some of the experiments has other uses too,\u0026rdquo; mused Pat as he carefully put away the sea-stained, still ruined radio. \u0026ldquo;Having your own private hot tub on the side of a tropical mountain is something I could get used to. But that luxury will give me little comfort if we can\u0026rsquo;t share the results of these experiments. I think the healing salve we were able to synthesize from the compounds of those species of fish that change gender may have real medical uses when, or if, we ever get back.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, we\u0026rsquo;ll get back someday. There are enough of the wrong people in the right places who know that we were thinking of this crazy expedition in the first place. They\u0026rsquo;ll soon enough put two and two together and figure out what we did,\u0026rdquo; laughed John.\n\u0026ldquo;I hope you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\nJohn gave Pat a reassuring thump on the back and jammed the spear into the soft loam floor of the hut. He looked down at his old friend with concern, searching the tanned lines of worry apparent around Pat\u0026rsquo;s eyes. They had always made a great team; Pat the brains and John the brawn. At 6' 3'' John was an intimidating force that could easily make an angry fisherman back off of a protected fishing area. Pat formulated strategies and remedies for the various confrontations they had engaged in. But they were also loners, two of a kind, in a sense. They worked well together because they worked alone.\n\u0026ldquo;What is it you think the fish goop will do?\u0026rdquo; asked John again.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure,\u0026rdquo; responded Pat. \u0026ldquo;The compound seems to work miracles in healing scratches. See?\u0026rdquo; he said as he showed the fresh pink mark on his arm to John.\n\u0026ldquo;That was this morning! It\u0026rsquo;s already healed!\u0026rdquo; marveled John. \u0026ldquo;It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a big cut, but it was a good one.\u0026rdquo; He turned Pat\u0026rsquo;s arm over slightly, tracing the thin, barely noticeable line along the outside of his arm. Pat had cut himself while trying to harvest some tree sap on a particularly thorny palm. It had been a deep cut, and Pat had put some of his homemade salve on it a few hours ago.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, amazing, isn\u0026rsquo;t it. I knew that those secretions had something to do with rebuilding cell structure,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\nAmong the many beautiful and exotic fish found along the barrier reef that stretched across the small lagoon to the west were a species of fish that procreated in unusual ways. Tropical \u0026ldquo;painted shell\u0026rdquo; fish live in communities of all female fish with a single male that dominate and protect the harem. The male fish is significantly larger; allowing him to collect abandoned shells for the much smaller females to nest inside. Roving bands of smaller males attempt to muscle in on established harems, but the biggest fish usually wins.\nThe odd part, however, is that all fish are born female. Every single fish is born female. When the male dies, the largest female changes her gender and becomes the alpha male of the harem. Sometimes several other large females challenge at the same time, and the ones who lose the fight are driven off, renegade males in search of new harems.\nPat had synthesized the secretions of the transforming female-to-male fish and applied that to his cut. The results had been nothing short of miraculous.\n\u0026ldquo;Man! It really worked!\u0026rdquo; said John. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s just the ticket because I seem to have gotten bit by something, a crab I think, while I was fishing for supper.\u0026rdquo; He turned his leg to show Pat and revealed a fresh tear in his calf. The wound wasn\u0026rsquo;t as long as Pat\u0026rsquo;s had been, but it was deeper.\n\u0026ldquo;Christ! Why didn\u0026rsquo;t you tell me you\u0026rsquo;d been hurt, and we\u0026rsquo;ve been sitting here wasting time. Does it hurt?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Nah, I barely feel it,\u0026rdquo; he responded. \u0026ldquo;You want to try that stuff on it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, it will confirm what I think has happened to me,\u0026rdquo; Pat enthused.\nPat took a small vial from a shelf and spread a small amount of cream colored liquid on John\u0026rsquo;s calf. John sighed immediately as the restorative effects of the salve began its work. Pat worked carefully, getting all parts of his wound covered.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, that stuff sure works quick. I don\u0026rsquo;t even feel the bite of the salt water any longer,\u0026rdquo; John reported. \u0026ldquo;Not only are we going to kick some government agency butt when we get back, we\u0026rsquo;ll be rich too!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;First, why don\u0026rsquo;t you see about getting that fish ready for dinner. I found some mangos while I was looking for those rubber trees and I think I can whip us up something that will knock your socks off,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\nThey had fallen into some routines early in their work. John could build just about any kind of shelter, keep a fire going in the rain, and hunt and trap food of all kinds. He was also a crack navigator, pilot, and could get anything that floated, flew, or rolled to almost any destination in the world. Pat, on the other hand, was a pure scientist who constantly tinkered and combined things to create new formulas and understandings of how things worked. This knowledge also contributed to his uncanny ability to cook. Because he understood, on a chemical level, how acids, bases, other elements of all food came together, he was an expert chef. Even stranded as they were on a remote and mostly ignored island, Pat had provided a steady diet of marvelous food flavored with the flora and fauna that surrounded them.\nAlthough neither of them would have identified their roles along gender lines, Pat stayed at home and performed domestic activities while John spent his days building and hunting to provide Pat the raw materials he needed to sustain their existence. The results of their combined labors were impressive. The \u0026ldquo;lab\u0026rdquo; was actually a series of small buildings perched on the lower half of the small volcano that gave birth to the island. The boat and its original fixtures had been completely transformed into a Swiss Family Robinson like camp they had constructed. The main hut was centered over a small geothermal vent that John had tamed into a forced air convection oven, a plain slab griddle, and a Bunsen burner that served as the catalyst for Pat\u0026rsquo;s various experiments. The hut was kept cool via the constant dripping of water from the thatched roof. An aqueduct constructed from bamboo fed the camp with a steady supply of water from a nearby mountain stream that was surprisingly cool given the amount of thermal activity in the area. Each man had his own sleeping hut similarly cooled, and a forth hut served as their storage area for basic foodstuffs.\nThe aqueduct also fed water into their \u0026ldquo;hot tub\u0026rdquo; that had been created out of natural depression in a rock outcropping just above the camp. John had diverted part of the hot air from the geothermal vent with scrape metal and a sort of cement he had invented that combined pulverized volcanic rock and the rubber sap Pat had used to try to fix the radio. The result was nearly invisible, except for the small valve the popped up from the edge of the rock pool that regulated the airflow in to the tub. The outcropping gave them clear views of the lagoon below and the sky above, and they both had enjoyed spending time in the warm, bubbling water as the evenings cooled and the starts twinkled.\nIf they got too hot, they could follow the aqueduct as it twisted and turned another hundred yards up and a few hundred yards west around the side of the mountain to the natural pool that had formed at the base of a small waterfall. The stream was spring fed and was cooler than almost any other, probably due to a large deposit of granite on that side of the volcano. Both Pat and John took daily jaunts up to the waterfall to bathe as the water was nether too cold nor too hot. It was a great way to rinse the salt, grit, and wind from their bodies after a long day cataloguing fish or collecting samples.\nAll in all, it was a paradise. The jungle was rich with fruits and roots, and the lagoon was rich with a wide variety of fish and shellfish. The days were hot but kept cool by the constant breezes, and the nights were cool and mild. Although neither man wanted to stay there forever, they weren\u0026rsquo;t panicked by the idea that rescue might be far off. They had carved out a pleasant lifestyle on the island, and they knew they would be missed eventually. All it took was time.\nThe delicate whitefish simmered in a mango broth was indeed the \u0026ldquo;knockyour -socks-off\u0026rdquo; meal that Pat had promised. The steamed hearts of palm with baby fronds were a magnificent complement to the fish. The only thing missing was a fine Chardonnay.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s too bad that the tropics don\u0026rsquo;t support grapes,\u0026rdquo; Pat mused as he finished the last of his fish. \u0026ldquo;Wine is the only part of civilization that I really miss out here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about that,\u0026rdquo; said John, \u0026ldquo;and tomorrow I\u0026rsquo;m going to see about building a small still from the last parts of the gas tank and boat engine. Seeing as how we don\u0026rsquo;t need the generator since the radio is kaput, we don\u0026rsquo;t need the engine either.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I suppose you\u0026rsquo;re right, but I am reluctant to dismantle the engine as I could still use the generator in the lab. I know we\u0026rsquo;ve discovered just about everything we set out to, but as long as we\u0026rsquo;re stuck here, I\u0026rsquo;d like to continue working,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but wouldn\u0026rsquo;t water power work? I can rig part of the aqueduct towards a water wheel, and that can power the generator, then we can use the last of the boat parts to construct a still. Besides, the still can be used for other things like making bigger batches of that fish goop, or cooking a really big stew for when we have guests over for dinner,\u0026rdquo; John said with a smirk.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just reluctant to dismantle the last remnants of the boat for what is basically a comfort measure \u0026hellip; but you\u0026rsquo;re right. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to use the micro-scanner or the computer very often, and we will eventually run out of gas. I guess we can start on that tomorrow,\u0026rdquo; said Pat with a sigh.\nThey cleaned up the last of the dinner and put the metal dishes into the \u0026ldquo;automatic dishwasher,\u0026rdquo; a small kettle that kept boiling fed by a constant stream of new water from the aqueduct. In the morning, all the dishes would be sterilized and the water would be ready for a coffee like brew that Pat made with crushed leaves and bark of several coca like plants.\nAs Pat lay awake on his bed, he marveled at the speed with which his cut had been healed. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t feel any trace of the wound, the new pink skin having perfectly blended with the rest of his arm. The moon had cast more than enough light, and he couldn\u0026rsquo;t see a trace of the deep scratch he had suffered only that morning. It was amazing, really; a first class medical discovery. It was a discovery, however, that would have to wait until they were rescued. And Pat knew it could be months before that happened, but he fell asleep with a smile on his face, knowing they could survive for years on the island.\nPat\u0026rsquo;s dreams that night were extraordinarily vivid. He was swimming in the lagoon, surrounded by thousands of brightly colored tropical fish. The water was warm and the sunlight softly illuminated the coral reef. He was underwater without any kind of snorkel or aqua-lung, but he wasn\u0026rsquo;t afraid. Above him, he could see the outline of John swimming above him, strong and sleek as his powerful strokes propelled him through the water. Pat felt safe and protected looking up at his large, well-built partner slicing through the water. When he woke in the morning, he felt strangely at peace.\nJohn shared similar dreams over their morning tea. He had been hunting sand sharks and had followed them down below the surface of the water before he realized that he was breathing naturally with no artificial aids. They both marveled at the vivid nature of the dreams but drew no other conclusions.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get started on the still, shall we?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;First I want to examine your calf,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\nJohn hefted his leg up onto the table he had built for their meals, and Pat carefully examined his former cut. Like his own, John\u0026rsquo;s cut was completely and nearly invisibly healed. \u0026ldquo;Amazing, just amazing!\u0026rdquo; marveled Pat, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s almost miraculous.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, at least we won\u0026rsquo;t be in danger getting a fatal infection from a skin wound while we\u0026rsquo;re stuck here! Let\u0026rsquo;s get started on the day, shall we?\u0026rdquo; prompted John.\nThey set to work immediately, and by midday, they had completed the modifications to the gas tank to make the still. Together they set off to gather the materials they would need to make their first batch of tropical beverage. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until the late afternoon that they took a break for food.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, do you notice a change in your energy level today?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat as he nibbled lightly on some fresh fruit.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, now that you mention it, I feel better than I\u0026rsquo;ve felt in a long time. We\u0026rsquo;ve been going strong all day, and it\u0026rsquo;s late for lunch, but I\u0026rsquo;m not starving or anything,\u0026rdquo; reported John as he tore into the whitefish Pat had brought with them.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m feeling very similarly,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;I wonder if it has anything to do with the salve I used on us yesterday?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It might, and if it did, then you\u0026rsquo;re an even bigger genius than I thought,\u0026rdquo; joked John. \u0026ldquo;I feel great!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So do I, but I hope there isn\u0026rsquo;t a piper to be paid for this tune,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean by that?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Probably nothing,\u0026rdquo; Pat mused. \u0026ldquo;If the goop is doing all this to us, it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely that this is all it\u0026rsquo;s doing. There might be more that is happening to us, but I\u0026rsquo;d have to run some tests.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seeing as how I feel really great, stronger than I\u0026rsquo;ve ever felt in my life, I\u0026rsquo;m not too worried about it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, John, I know. But \u0026hellip; and I do mean but, I am not feeling strength, though I do feel pretty good. High energy is more like it.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn gave his old friend a good look. Pat had always been the thinner of the two men, smaller in stature, but always in good shape. Both of their hair had grown longer and both kept it in a pony tail most of the time. Pat\u0026rsquo;s hair, however, looked thicker today for some strange reason, and softer as it fell about his face and glasses. Now what made that thought come to mind? John looked at his own feet and hands as he puzzled over the sudden embarrassment that washed over him when he looked at Pat. What was that about?\nPat didn\u0026rsquo;t notice John\u0026rsquo;s piercing gaze and subsequent embarrassment. He was trying to catalogue how he felt and had his eyes closed, concentrating on feeling his body. He had noticed that his hair seemed healthier this morning, a bit fuller and lighter in color. He hoped that was simply the vitality the goop had created and not what he already suspected might be a side effect of the fish compound. He noticed that the breeze felt fresh and delicate on his face, and the warmth of the sun seemed more present on his skin. Everything seemed more colorful, alive; it was like his senses had been switched on to full power for the first time in his life. He also noted that his vision seemed to be changing, he saw colors, particularly reds, much more vividly, or so he thought, and the glasses seemed less necessary as the day wore on. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sure, yet, and so he said nothing.\nThey finished their meal and gathered the supplies they hoped would produce their first batch of tropical wine. When they got back to the camp, they immediately started on their first attempt.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think we should use more citrus or more berry in the mix?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Berry, definitely berry. There\u0026rsquo;s already too much acid in the mash, and we need more sugars,\u0026rdquo; said Pat, \u0026ldquo;sugar!\u0026rdquo;\nJohn glanced up at his friend and gave him a strange smile. They never called each other by pet names. What the heck was that for, and why was he feeling embarrassed each time he glanced at Pat? John pushed these thoughts aside and hefted another load of star fruit, guava, and wild-berry mix into the fermentation pot.\nPat concentrated on adjusting the fire beneath the pot, furious with himself for calling John by an endearment. What was he doing? Where had that come from? Why was he feeling so awkward around his old friend? That sort of thing had never happened before.\n\u0026ldquo;This is going to need to cook for a few hours. What do you say we wash the grime of the jungle off before we tackle dinner?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure buddy,\u0026rdquo; John emphasized the \u0026lsquo;buddy,\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s go jump in the hot tub.\u0026rdquo;\nThey both went to their own huts and took off their nylon shorts in preparation for a swim. Both men had been naked in front of each other many times, but both felt a hesitation this time. John looked down at himself and could see the stirrings of an erection, his cock half-hard and beginning to fill with blood. Pat looked down and wondered if he had always looked this scrawny, and he noticed that his body hair seemed lighter. He pushed his fears aside when he heard John splash into the hot tub, and Pat left his hut.\nJohn relaxed in the tub and the warm water gently swirled and bubbled around him. He had taken great pains to follow Pat\u0026rsquo;s engineering to the letter, and the hot tub was not only a working wonder in the jungle, it was beautiful to behold. The polished black rock made a perfect basin for the tub, and he had used parts from the boat to make the hot air bubble through the fresh water. Between the cool water and the hot air, the tub was usually very pleasant.\nAs Pat walked up the path towards the tub, John noticed the something else was very different about him. Pat seemed paler, losing some of the golden tan they had both acquired. John also felt the return of his embarrassment; no-it wasn\u0026rsquo;t embarrassment-it was attraction. John felt attracted to his old friend and co-worker Pat. Impossible! He had never felt that way before! Sure, he loved Pat and wasn\u0026rsquo;t afraid to say it when it really mattered, but he had never felt sexually attracted to him or any man. He tore his eyes from Pat and looked instead off into the distance over the ocean where the beginnings of a sunset teased the horizon.\nPat had felt the white heat of John\u0026rsquo;s stare and recognized the embarrassed look John had now. But, because he couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of anything else he should do, he simply slipped into the water opposite his old friend. Both men had let their hair down, and Pat noticed that John\u0026rsquo;s hair was darker and healthier than ever. In fact, all of John\u0026rsquo;s hair seemed darker and healthier. There was hair on his chest and shoulders, and his navel and his \u0026hellip; Pat broke his gaze away, realizing that he had been staring at John\u0026rsquo;s crotch.\nThey both sat in silence for many minutes before Pat finally announced that he had had enough for one evening. John muttered good night, and Pat walked back down to his sleeping hut alone. When he stepped into the soft glow of the oil lamp he had rigged, he looked at himself carefully in the mirror. He took off his glasses and noted that he no longer needed them; he could see perfectly. What ever was happening to him, it was going to be a doozy.\nThe changes were more obvious now, he thought to himself. He had felt his body tingling and twitching constantly while sitting in John\u0026rsquo;s presence in the hot tub, and the psychological changes were more pronounced than he had suspected. Pat understood the mechanisms that the painted shell fish had undergone during their sex change, but he hadn\u0026rsquo;t thought the opposite was possible or likely. Looking at his considerably longer hair, softened facial features, and subtly thinner waist, he was now sure that it was not only possible, but that it was happening to him.\nWhat was odd, he thought to himself, was that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t too upset. He had never had a significant relationship with either a man or a woman because he was so wrapped up in his work. Pat had long thought that he might be gay, and though that thought didn\u0026rsquo;t upset him, he had never been attracted enough to anyone to act on it. Correction, he thought to himself, he had never been attracted to another gay man enough to act on it. He knew that his friendship with John was the longest relationship he had ever had, but he also knew that John was about a straight as they come.\nPat looked closer into the mirror. His eyes had shifted color from their normal blue/green to a more brilliant green. His normally dirty blond hair seemed to be moving towards an auburn or red tint. His chest and arms were nearly hairless, and his pubic hair seemed thinner. He still looked like himself, he decided, though he could see that femininity was creeping into his body structure and facial features.\nHe heard John come back through the camp and go into his own hut. He fought an urge to go to him and instead slipped into his bed and fell almost immediately asleep. Just like the night before, Pat began having extraordinary and vivid dreams. This time Pat found himself floating in the hot tub, looking out over a surreal sunset. John was standing at the edge of the cliff, framed against the rich colors of the sunset, posing like a Greek god. Pat could feel his long hair float about his body, gently caressing himself, and he was aware of a heavy weight on his chest. In his dream, he looked down and saw two large female breasts sprouting up through the surface of the water, their thick nipples erect in the cool evening air. Pat struggled to wake up, and found it was the next morning.\nFor the next two months, both men struggled with their quickly developing, new feelings for each other, but the physical changes slowly progressed for both men. John had slowly become the picture of male vitality, sharply muscled with wide shoulders tapering down to a washboard waist and strong thighs. Pat, on the other hand, had continued to slim down, and his hips had ached as they ever so slightly widened while he often felt like a great weight sat on his rib cage as his bones seemed to slowly shrink in his arms, legs, and chest.\nTheir only solace was that they had completed the still and therefore enjoyed many batches of a sweet, tropical rum punch. Each man had been self-medicating with the punch, hoping that the feelings of attraction would fade away. They avoided each other as much as possible, meeting only during meals. At the end of the two months, they both knew that significant changes were occurring, but their feelings of attraction and confusion had far outstripped the actual physical changes.\nPat stood, for the hundredth time, before the mirror in his hut. He catalogued, once again, the changes his body had undergone. He was a few inches shorter, his waist was slightly indented above hips that had widened slightly. His hair was a darker auburn and his eyes were greener than they had been a few weeks ago. His body hair had thinned or fallen out to the point where it wasn\u0026rsquo;t noticeable, and his lips seemed ever so slightly thicker. He felt sure that the goop had wrought these changes, but he was surprised at his feelings concerning the changes.\nHe liked them.\nHe knew that the goop was slowly changing his gender, or at least that is what it would probably do. He knew that John was the more physically dominant human of the two of them, and so if the goop was going to imitate in humans what it did in fish, Pat was going to be the female of the species. The prospect thrilled him and frightened him. Why did he have these feelings? He had never before focused much on sex; he had always had his work. But as he stared at his morphed body in the mirror, he was sure that he wanted to see this experiment continue.\nOf course, he was a man of science. Well, perhaps not a man, at any rate, much longer, he thought to himself.\nHe turned away from the mirror and went into the connecting hut that served as the laboratory. He picked up the bottle that contained the goop and then went to the still. John had already gone up to the hot tub to ease away the pains of the day, and so Pat could work in privacy. He drew two long drinks of the tropical punch in two bamboo mugs, and then he put a liberal dose of the fish goop into each drink. He stirred them slightly, and then with his heart pounding, he walked up the path towards the hot tub, carrying the two drinks. Pat was sure that if superficial application of the goop to their skins had already wrought these changes, then an internal application of a massive amount of goop might do the trick.\nJohn was comfortably lounging in the warm and bubbling water, naked. Pat had rarely come up to the hot tub for the last month, so John felt reasonably safe from both his own feelings and from what he suspected were Pat\u0026rsquo;s feelings as well. John was as equally puzzled as Pat; he had always been attracted to women, and had left several beauties in his wake. Why then, he wondered, was he so attracted to his oldest, best, and male friend? He was pondering this question, with his eyes closed, when he heard Pat slip into the hot tub opposite him.\n\u0026ldquo;Pat, you startled me,\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed, sitting straight, the waves he stirred up nearly causing Pat to spill the drinks he was balancing. \u0026ldquo;What are you up to?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Me? Not much. I got tired of us treating each other like strangers and thought that a toast to old times might help. What do you say, my old friend?\u0026rdquo; Pat paused, holding one drink out to John. John took a slight moment, and then reached out to grasp the proffered beverage, rising slightly from the water and giving Pat a clear view of his crotch. Pat felt himself blush as he realized what he was seeing. He also felt himself get warm and tingly all over.\n\u0026ldquo;I suppose you\u0026rsquo;re right, we have been treating each other strangely,\u0026rdquo; John mused, sipping his drink. \u0026ldquo;Why do you suppose that is?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have lots of theories, and none of them are easy. My best guess, as I am sure that you are already aware, is that the fish goop has altered our bodies and our feelings. Does that about sum it up?\u0026rdquo; Pat stared boldly at his friend, seeking encouragement for what he hoped would begin to happen.\n\u0026ldquo;I think you have put it, as usual, succinctly and accurately. What do we do about it?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, if it\u0026rsquo;s o.k. with you, I think we should deal with it head on, so to speak,\u0026rdquo; Pat suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean by that?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I can see that you\u0026rsquo;ve become more masculine, and I also can see that you\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that I\u0026rsquo;ve become more feminine. If your feelings towards me are similar to the ones I\u0026rsquo;m feeling towards you, then you have become attracted to me. Am I right so far?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\nJohn let out a deep sigh, and began to softly chuckle. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s right, my old friend. You rarely beat around the bush when it comes to crises. I\u0026rsquo;ve been going crazy trying to figure out why I started to find you so sexy. Now, I guess, I know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ditto. Would you be adverse to seeing the experiment reach its logical conclusion?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked hesitantly.\n\u0026ldquo;You mean more goop?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, and more changes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean you\u0026rsquo;re willing to let the changes continue?\u0026rdquo; asked John with surprise. \u0026ldquo;That means that you might become a woman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Pat stated.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, wow.\u0026rdquo; Pat paused. \u0026ldquo;So, what do you want?\u0026rdquo;\nJohn looked across the pool at his oldest and best friend. He could see the changes that had already happened as Pat had entered the pool naked too, and the changes were all towards an old fantasy woman he had since college: auburn hair, green eyes, tall and voluptuous. \u0026ldquo;I think that the changes are being triggered by me. I mean I have to participate in this experiment too, right? The fish only changed while in the absence of a male, so you\u0026rsquo;ll probably only fully change in the presence of one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have always known that your brains far exceeded everyone\u0026rsquo;s perceptions,\u0026rdquo; Pat teased.\n\u0026ldquo;So, what do we do now,\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Drink up!\u0026rdquo; replied Pat, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m afraid that I already spiked the punch in anticipation of your agreement.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s to the start of a beautiful friend \u0026hellip; ship,\u0026rdquo; toasted John as he gulped the large drink down. Pat matched his old friend, swallow for swallow. They both put down their bamboo mugs and looked across the pool at each other. They both knew what was going to happen, but neither knew exactly how or when the changes would occur. The longer they stared at each other, the greater the tension grew.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t take it any longer,\u0026rdquo; sputtered John as he waded across the pool towards the transfixed Pat, \u0026ldquo;I have to kiss you. I know you still look like my old buddy, more or less, but I can\u0026rsquo;t stop this feeling growing inside me.\u0026rdquo;\nPat lifted his face towards his old friend as John slowly lowered himself next to him in the pool. He had seen the raging hard on that John had, and he had felt tingly and warm as John approached him. Pat was hyper aware of the smell of John, a deep musk scent that was driving him crazy. As John put his arm around his shoulders, it seemed perfectly natural that he should tilt his head back to accept his kiss.\nThe kiss \u0026hellip; it was electric. Pat felt like a live wire had suddenly been attached to his lips. His whole body felt like it was on fire, and he was sure it wasn\u0026rsquo;t because he was in the hot tub. The press of John\u0026rsquo;s lips against his own was gentle but persistent, and suddenly he felt John\u0026rsquo;s tongue slip inside his own mouth. He found it hard to breathe, suddenly, and felt crushed by John\u0026rsquo;s arms as they tightened around his shoulders. But he didn\u0026rsquo;t want to stop kissing, he didn\u0026rsquo;t want to break the contact that provided his lips with the buzz of pleasure that he had never known it was possible to feel.\nJohn gently drew back from the kiss and looked down at Pat as his old friend swooned in the afterglow of their kiss. In the few minutes that they had been kissing, John could already see small changes in Pat\u0026rsquo;s body. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t put is finger on it, but there seemed to be something decidedly feminine about his old friend, a stronger sense that Pat was well on his way towards Patricia.\nHis hair was longer and the hair nearest the scalp appeared to be a richer auburn color than the rest. Pat\u0026rsquo;s face seemed more feminine, and his lips were fuller, swollen from the passion of the kiss. When Pat\u0026rsquo;s eyes fluttered open, they were even brighter green than before, and now they glistened with emotion.\n\u0026ldquo;I know that most cell structures replace themselves over relatively long periods of time, except for bones,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, \u0026ldquo;But those fish seem to change genders in a few days.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They are much less complex creatures than we are?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Not really,\u0026rdquo; explained Pat as he gazed back into John\u0026rsquo;s dark eyes, \u0026ldquo;The DNA we share with the rest of creation, mammals, fish, even insects, is actually quite significant. I\u0026rsquo;ll bet we follow a similar time table.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are you saying?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;I think you should \u0026lsquo;dominate\u0026rsquo; me for the next couple of days, you know, stay with me and see if my bio-mechanical changes occur in similar ways to the fish,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained.\nJohn smiled. \u0026ldquo;Well, the sooner we get this change completed, the better. I\u0026rsquo;ve been going crazy with wondering what I should do about this monster between my legs.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not ready for much past kissing tonight, John,\u0026rdquo; Pat shuddered involuntarily, \u0026ldquo;But I strongly suspect that if the goop works as it does in the fish, I won\u0026rsquo;t feel that way for long.\u0026rdquo;\nThey spent another few moments enjoying the closeness and intimacy of their hot tub. Pat noticed how much smaller he felt when held by John. He swore that he could almost feel the changes occurring, but he knew that was ridiculous. Unless, he mused, the goop released enzymes and proteins that attacked and changed bone structure. That might explain why his male body had taken on feminine proportions very quickly. His mind, however, he could clearly feel was well ahead of his body towards a female mindset. He snuggled in closer to John as the tropical evening blossomed into thousands of stars.\nThey decided to sleep in the same bed so that the changes would be as accelerated as possible. The next morning when Pat awoke, he found that his shoulders seemed a bit smaller and his rib cage had constricted further. He fixed himself another glass of goop mixed with punch and downed it before John woke up. The goop seemed to energize him, giving him incredible energy and speeding up his natural metabolism. It was better than coffee, but Pat suspected that the goop would be doing much more than simply waking him up.\nWhen John awoke, Pat twirled before him.\n\u0026ldquo;Your waist is smaller, and so are your shoulders, but I don\u0026rsquo;t see any other differences,\u0026rdquo; John observed.\n\u0026ldquo;I feel different,\u0026rdquo; Pat stated. \u0026ldquo;I feel more \u0026hellip; weak \u0026hellip; but in a good way. I don\u0026rsquo;t know, it\u0026rsquo;s strange. I can tell I am smaller, but there is something more important going on, I feel even more strongly attracted to you. And you\u0026rsquo;ve changed too!\u0026rdquo;\nJohn looked at the mirror Pat had brought from his hut. John\u0026rsquo;s hair was thicker and curly, and he felt great, stronger. He flexed in the mirror, impressed with the definition of his muscles.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I like it,\u0026rdquo; Pat murmured.\nThey locked eyes, and Pat threw himself at John with a low growl and thrust his own tongue inside John\u0026rsquo;s surprised mouth.\nThey kissed for several minutes with growing intensity, as fiery warmth surged through Pat\u0026rsquo;s body. Finally, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t stand the tension any longer and broke away from each other.\n\u0026ldquo;We better get breakfast started before we start something we can\u0026rsquo;t finish,\u0026rdquo; John said awkwardly, trying unsuccessfully to get his hard on to settle down.\n\u0026ldquo;I know you\u0026rsquo;re right, but I feel so impatient,\u0026rdquo; Pat complained. \u0026ldquo;So, let\u0026rsquo;s go down to the water together, remember I\u0026rsquo;ll change more quickly in your presence.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good idea,\u0026rdquo; John thought, \u0026ldquo;we can spend the day at the beach just having fun, for once, rather than doing research.\u0026rdquo;\nThey both walked down to the beach, and John hunted fish while Pat looked for fresh seaweed and other edibles that may have washed ashore during the night. They spent the day in or near the water, keeping out of the sun in the beach huts that they had rebuilt after the tsunami, cooking the fish over an open fire, and swimming for fun rather than to catalogue species. They were both much more interested in the experiment they were engaged in than the original work they had come to the island to do.\nPat recognized the continual power of the goop as the day progressed. He often sought the water because his hips hurt so much, and it felt nice to get off his legs and just float in the water. Both Pat and John were floating in the late after noon when Pat felt an odd pulling in his groin and groaned in surprise.\n\u0026ldquo;What is it? Did something bite you,\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhh, no \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip;. Oooooh, that feels so strange,\u0026rdquo; Pat moaned. \u0026ldquo;Something is happening in my lower intestine.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn sat up in the shallow water and reached over to Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow \u0026hellip; you\u0026rsquo;re really changing,\u0026rdquo; remarked John. \u0026ldquo;Your hips are much wider and your penis is nearly gone. I can barely see it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I could have told you that, but I think this goop is much stronger than I suspected,\u0026rdquo; explained Pat. \u0026ldquo;I think my organs and bones are being broken down and rebuilt much faster than normal metabolism would account. And it hurts \u0026hellip; aaaaaah,\u0026rdquo; moaned Pat as he sat up.\nJohn was astounded by what he saw. Pat had crossed a line from masculine towards feminine from which there now seemed to be no return. Pat\u0026rsquo;s entire musculature had shrunken, and his features had become delicate and pretty.\nPat looked down at his changing body, intimately aware of each shift in his body. He swore could feel a slow steady compression of his waist even as his hips were inexorably expanding. Despite the discomfort, his whole body felt alive with electricity and energy. He looked at John with feral eyes, devouring the hunk of manhood who floated next to him. He noticed that John\u0026rsquo;s shoulders seemed wider, more muscled, and his hips seemed narrower. His cock was astounding! It was hard and erect, poking above the surface of the water, apparently at least nine inches long and as thick as his wrist.\nPat reveled in the intensity of the growing desire the knotted itself in his stomach. He had never felt this way about anything, and he was thrilled that he could feel this way. He simply wanted John, wanted to smell him, touch him, and devour him. Pat leaned forward and grasped John\u0026rsquo;s magnificent cock. It throbbed in his smaller hand, pulsing with John\u0026rsquo;s pounding heart. Each pulse sent a thrill through Pat\u0026rsquo;s hand and up his arm and through his body. He could feel the goop doing its work.\nJohn watched, fascinated, as Pat held his pulsing cock in his/her hand. Pat began stroking his cock, and John knew he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t last long.\n\u0026ldquo;You won\u0026rsquo;t have to do that for very long, Pat, I\u0026rsquo;m close to losing it,\u0026rdquo; panted John.\nPat was thrilled by the look of desire burning in John\u0026rsquo;s eyes. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t see himself, but he was sure that he looked more female than male. He certainly felt more female than male, and he had a sudden inspiration to help speed the process.\n\u0026ldquo;Come here,\u0026rdquo; urged Pat as he pulled John up onto the beach by his rampant cock. He soon positioned John on the sand and knelt before him. John noted that Pat had a classic female shape, and that his/her legs folded up underneath wide thighs that flowed into a very nice set of hips and plump firm ass. His/her waist sharply indented above the hips and then flowed back out gently into a small rib cage and delicate shoulders. Pat\u0026rsquo;s nipples seemed darker and slightly puffy, but no other significant changes could be noted. Pat\u0026rsquo;s hair was long, thick, and soft, and framed a face that was now clearly feminine and beautiful.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you doing,\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Speeding things up,\u0026rdquo; replied Pat as he lowered his head down to John\u0026rsquo;s lap and took his cock in his mouth.\nThe salt of the sea mixed with John\u0026rsquo;s own sweat and musk and Pat found the combination intoxicating. He moved his head up and down with vigor, remembering how he liked his own, now nearly gone, cock stroked when he masturbated. John\u0026rsquo;s breathing quickly grew ragged as Pat assaulted his stiff cock. Pat marveled at the feelings of having that velvet head push past his lips and feeling the raging hardness underneath the soft skin of John\u0026rsquo;s cock. Pat opened his throat and took all nine inches of cock inside his mouth and slightly bit down at the base of John\u0026rsquo;s cock, his nose buried inside a thick mat of public hair.\n\u0026ldquo;Aaaaaah,\u0026rdquo; John moaned as he exploded in Pat\u0026rsquo;s eager mouth. Pat felt the warm cum gush down his throat, and he pulled back slightly so that he could catch the rest in his mouth. His strategy worked, and as he sucked slightly and swirled his tongue around the tip of John\u0026rsquo;s cock, John let loose a second eruption equal to the first. Pat savored the salty, musky flavor of his best friend\u0026rsquo;s cum, and sat back to wipe the small amount of cum from his/her lips that had some how escaped Pat\u0026rsquo;s eager efforts.\n\u0026ldquo;That was fun,\u0026rdquo; Pat observed.\n\u0026ldquo;Fun, you had fun?\u0026rdquo; a stunned and recovering John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I did \u0026hellip; I told you that goop was strong stuff. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have done that last night, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have stopped myself today,\u0026rdquo; explained Pat. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that the goop works nearly the same in fish as humans, which means I need another dose as I haven\u0026rsquo;t had any since this morning. Those fish just produce it themselves.\u0026rdquo;\nPat gave John\u0026rsquo;s cock one last caress and started to head back to the mountain lab. John grabbed the fish and seaweed they had collected during the day and caught up as they entered the late afternoon jungle. As he watched Pat walk up the path ahead of him, there was no way he could still call his old buddy a \u0026lsquo;he.\u0026rsquo; Pat\u0026rsquo;s figure was astounding, with long sexy legs that led up to a world class ass, full and firm, topped with a very thin waist, delicate shoulders and arms, and a full, rich head of feminine hair that fell to the middle of \u0026lsquo;her\u0026rsquo; back. Despite the recent orgasm on the beach, John could feel the stirrings of lust again as he watched Pat\u0026rsquo;s hips sway back and forth as she made her way up the mountain path.\nPat for his part had also made the gender switch in his/her head. She was certain of her direction, and hyper conscious of her body. She could feel her hips swing back and forth and her widened bone structure demanded a different stride. She could feel her thick and lustrous hair sweep along her shoulders and back. She could feel how light and delicate her arms and hands felt, and she could feel that something was happening in her groin. She was certain that she wanted it to happen \u0026hellip; the sooner the better as John was getting all the satisfaction, and she recognized how horny she was feeling.\nThey made it back to the huts and Pat immediately fixed another large dose of goop mixed with punch while fixing a punch with only a little bit for John. She handed him the mug, and offered a toast.\n\u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s to tomorrow morning,\u0026rdquo; smiled Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Tomorrow?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Tomorrow, if my calculations are correct, will be the day that you stop being the only one who is enjoying himself,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry \u0026hellip; but \u0026hellip; I mean \u0026hellip; is there \u0026hellip; jeesh, what should I do?\u0026rdquo; stumbled John?\n\u0026ldquo;Drink up!\u0026rdquo; answered Pat.\nThey both tossed back their drinks, and Pat quickly assembled a dinner of fish and fruit. She was ravenous, and she suspected that the demands of her speeded up metabolism were to blame. After dinner, they decided to head for the hot tub again.\nAs John watched Pat slip into the water in the evening dusk, he noted that Pat\u0026rsquo;s nipples were now very prominent, looking similar to a young girls'. Everything about her was female, and her crotch looked like a vagina in the darkness, with a classic \u0026lsquo;v\u0026rsquo; of pubic hair above a puffy Venus mound.\nPat noticed John\u0026rsquo;s gaze and waded to him, until she was standing over his reclined form. She reached down and grasped his hard cock.\n\u0026ldquo;Does this thing every go down?\u0026rdquo; she teased?\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s never done this before,\u0026rdquo; answered John, \u0026ldquo;and it\u0026rsquo;s never been this big either.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Another gift of the goop, I suspect,\u0026rdquo; mused Pat.\nShe continued to hold only John\u0026rsquo;s cock, feeling the water lapping at her now very sensitive skin. Her waist was just at water level, and she could tell that her whole body was nearly done changing. She stood up so that the water came to the base of her hips, exposing her crotch to the air. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s moving inside me \u0026hellip; I can feel it,\u0026rdquo; Pat breathed as both she and John watched the tiny remnants of a cock was absorbed into her Venus mound, looking more and more like a clit. Incredibly sensuous feelings washed over Pat, forcing her wide hips to rock back and forth above the water. John could see that a vagina now occupied the now wide space between her legs, covered with a soft down of auburn pubic hair.\nIf possible, Pat felt John\u0026rsquo;s cock get even harder and thicker, and he knew where that cock should go, but she knew she wasn\u0026rsquo;t finished. Without letting go of John\u0026rsquo;s cock, she threw a leg across John\u0026rsquo;s startled face, and slid herself onto that beautiful pole of man meat. John\u0026rsquo;s cock twitched as Pat rubbed her soft pubic hair against his cock, trapping his man meat between her undeveloped vagina and his washboard stomach.\nSlowly and sensuously, Pat rocked back and forth, sliding her new anatomy across John\u0026rsquo;s cock. The water from the hot tub provided the lubrication, and Pat could feel the stirrings of her womb, rushing to complete itself \u0026hellip; to accept this monstrous cock within. John\u0026rsquo;s hands traced the graceful curve of her hips up to her waist and then across her now very puffy nipples. She gasped as his rough hands grazed her stiff nipples. She looked down, and saw that they were much larger than this afternoon, and the areola looked to be about one inch in diameter and the nipple was the size of her pinky. There was only about an inch of flesh behind each nipple, a small A cup. Nevertheless, John\u0026rsquo;s touch was electric.\nJohn leaned forward, took a nipple into his mouth, and gently bit down. Pat nearly passed out with pleasure, grabbing his head and pressing it into her developing breasts. Her rocking hips grew more urgent, and suddenly John stiffened and groaned in pleasure. Pat felt his white hot cum splash on her stomach and thighs. They stayed entwined in the hot tub for several minutes, feeling each other\u0026rsquo;s body in the warm evening air as the warm water slowly washed them clean.\n\u0026ldquo;I cannot wait until tomorrow,\u0026rdquo; Pat growled.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe I can help,\u0026rdquo; offered John.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I want to do it right \u0026hellip; and I can wait \u0026hellip; hell, I haven\u0026rsquo;t had any kind of sex in a long time, and it can wait one more day,\u0026rdquo; mused Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;So, I guess it\u0026rsquo;s Patricia now, eh?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Almost!\u0026rdquo; laughed Pat, \u0026ldquo;But you should keep calling me Pat \u0026hellip; I like it. Keeps me from getting confused. I\u0026rsquo;m still me, if you know what I mean.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, I haven\u0026rsquo;t changed the way you have, but I\u0026rsquo;ll still keep calling you Pat,\u0026rdquo; said John.\n\u0026ldquo;Good, what do you say we go to bed?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a great idea,\u0026rdquo; said John, as they rose from the tub together.\nThey walked back to John\u0026rsquo;s hut arm in arm, with John\u0026rsquo;s hand resting on the top side of Pat\u0026rsquo;s wide and womanly hips.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s odd,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s odd?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;I can feel my breasts bouncing as I walk,\u0026rdquo; reported Pat. \u0026ldquo;This is the first time I can remember feeling conscious of them, though I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed all day that they have been constantly but slowly growing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How\u0026rsquo;s it feel?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Good, I think.\u0026rdquo; Said Pat. \u0026ldquo;I mean, I\u0026rsquo;ve never had breasts before, but I like the fact that I\u0026rsquo;m growing them, and that tomorrow you\u0026rsquo;ll be even more attracted to me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more attracted to you than I already am,\u0026rdquo; protested John.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t wait until I\u0026rsquo;m the most beautiful woman you\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen,\u0026rdquo; teased Pat, \u0026ldquo;and you\u0026rsquo;ll be helpless before me, my pleasure slave!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, I thought the male was the dominant gender of the species,\u0026rdquo; said John.\n\u0026ldquo;All males think so, but I\u0026rsquo;m learning it\u0026rsquo;s different!\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;I love the way I feel, the way I make you feel, and the way I\u0026rsquo;m changing. You forget, I know what a man feels when he sees a beautiful woman, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to enjoy being that powerful!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m doomed,\u0026rdquo; cried John.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, doomed alright,\u0026rdquo; teased Pat. \u0026ldquo;You will be stranded in paradise with the woman of your dreams who will want to make love to you day and night. That sounds pretty rough to me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t take it any more, let\u0026rsquo;s get you to bed,\u0026rdquo; said John.\nThey tumbled into bed and quickly fell asleep entwined together in the cool night air. During the night, the goop continued its work, and when Pat woke in the morning sun, she knew she was complete.\nPat got up and walked over to the mirror and looked down at her slender and feminine torso, and noted that her nipples had expanded well beyond their previous size. Her areolas were the size of silver dollars and her nipples were about an inch above the surface of her skin. Her waist was even narrower, and her vagina was dripping down her thigh. She was powerfully horny, and she knew it.\nJohn stirred awake and saw a goddess standing before a mirror admiring her figure. She was tall for a woman, and looked like a 36D chest, an amazing 22 inch waist, and probably 38 inch hips. Her long hair reached to her lower back, and her skin was smooth and pale despite yesterday\u0026rsquo;s sun. She brought her hands up to her breasts and weighed each in one hand. She giggled and turned to see John staring at her.\n\u0026ldquo;Like what you see?\u0026rdquo; she asked\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god,\u0026rdquo; he breathed.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t tell you how good these feel,\u0026rdquo; Pat moaned as she continued to stroke her breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you let me feel for myself?\u0026rdquo; he teased.\nPat sashayed over to the bed, enjoying how her body moved and jiggled in places that her body had never jiggled before. John\u0026rsquo;s cock had risen to its full hardness and stuck up at a funny angle from his crotch. Pat stopped at the end of the bed and leaned down on all fours, and she began to crawl up John\u0026rsquo;s body. She dragged her full breasts against his legs as she licked and then gave a quick tug on his cock with her mouth. Pat loved the way her breasts felt as they rubbed against John\u0026rsquo;s hairy legs. Her nipples were almost painfully hard, and each bump or snag of her nipples along his legs sent a thrill of pleasure racing along her body to her crotch.\nShe snaked her way up his body, raining kisses along his stomach and chest. When she could feel her own nipples pressing into his, she lifted up and kissed him hard on the mouth, their tongues battling each other. God, she was so hot. Her womb seemed to throb with need, an ache that had to be filled. She was literally dripping in his crotch as she humped his leg.\nSuddenly the white heat that had been building surged in through her body. Pat could feel electric sparks pass between John\u0026rsquo;s lips and her own. She could take it no longer and suddenly felt a crashing wave of pleasure roll up through her body, her pelvis rocking against John\u0026rsquo;s in successive jolts of involuntary movement. Her first orgasm! It seemed to go on, and on, each wave more intense than the previous. She sat up and rode out the finish of the incredible pleasure that she had never known. As the last waves of pleasure pulsed through her body, she reveled in that part of her body that jerked and jiggled after her passion had peaked.\nHer breasts.\nHer chest sloped away from his shoulders in twin peaks of pleasure, ending in prominent nipples that ached with desire. John began sucking on her right breast, and Pat brought her hand to the left breast. She ran her hand lightly under the swell of the breast, noting that there was at least four or five inches of flesh that extended beyond her ribcage. The breast was heavy but firm, and very soft and yielding. Her nipple was stiff in the air, the sweat she had just generated dripping from it\u0026rsquo;s upturned tip. She pinched the nipple and was rewarded with a jolt of pleasure that shot to her groin and back to her compressed nipple.\nPat gently lifted John\u0026rsquo;s head away from her breast and looked deeply into his eyes. \u0026ldquo;Now, we can make love,\u0026rdquo; she said, as she reached down and positioned John\u0026rsquo;s cock below her dripping opening. She slowly eased down on his cock, feeling her new flesh being stretched by the invading pole. Inch by inch, John\u0026rsquo;s cock slowly disappeared inside her steaming crotch. Suddenly, there was a catch. Something was in the way.\n\u0026ldquo;Go easy, you\u0026rsquo;re a virgin,\u0026rdquo; said John.\n\u0026ldquo;Not for long, damit,\u0026rdquo; growled Pat, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been waiting for this moment for a long time.\u0026rdquo; With that, she plunged her hips down is a sudden swift thrust.\nThe first jab of white-hot pain was immediately replaced by a thick, warm, fullness, and Pat could feel the top of John\u0026rsquo;s cock press up against the top of her cervix.\n\u0026ldquo;Ooooooh,\u0026rdquo; Pat moaned with pleasure, \u0026ldquo;That feels soooooooo goooooooood.\u0026rdquo; She placed her hands on John\u0026rsquo;s massive shoulders and leaned back, looking at their joined hips below. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never felt this way before,\u0026rdquo; Pat suddenly giggled at the irony of that statement. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe how good it feels.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, baby, it\u0026rsquo;s nothing like the way I feel,\u0026rdquo; John breathed, his body rigid with passion, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never felt anything so tight and hot in my life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, me too. I can feel your thick cock up inside me, and I can,\u0026rdquo; Pat grunted as she put words and action together, \u0026ldquo;squeeze you with my cunt.\u0026rdquo;\nShe began to rock her hips, and reveled in feeling the slow shake of her feminine ass as it jiggled and shook with each roll of her hips. She could feel John\u0026rsquo;s cock stroke in and out of her hot and wet cunt, her stiff clit rubbing against the thick pubic hair of John\u0026rsquo;s crotch. She knew she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t last long.\n\u0026ldquo;Look at me, John, I\u0026rsquo;m complete. I am a woman \u0026hellip; your woman. Look at my breasts, my huge, firm breasts, see how my nipples are stiff with desire, desire that only you can satisfy. Feel them \u0026hellip;. Aaaaahhhh, that\u0026rsquo;s right, pinch \u0026hellip; ooooohhhh the nipples. Oh, John, I want you to cum in me, I\u0026rsquo;m going to cum \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m \u0026hellip; going \u0026hellip; to \u0026hellip; ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, uh, uh, uh,\u0026rdquo; Pat\u0026rsquo;s body shook with pleasure as she felt John\u0026rsquo;s hot cum splash deep inside her. Pat couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop screaming or shaking as the long, powerful orgasm kept pulsing through her body, her breasts shaking forcefully with each jolt. John held on to her tiny waist for dear life, pumping his seed into her twitching cunt.\nThey held each other for a long time, and Pat thought as she gave John\u0026rsquo;s softening cock another squeeze with her still new and wonderful vaginal muscles. Now, she really didn\u0026rsquo;t care at all when or if they ever got rescued.\n02 - Daniel\u0026rsquo;s Story The sinking sun set the sand afire with golden light, which made the beach a beacon of hope for Daniel Sherman, ex-womanizing-drug runner. The thugs sent to kill him hadn\u0026rsquo;t quite finished the job. They had done plenty, however, and Daniel\u0026rsquo;s broken leg was thanks to the \u0026ldquo;helping hand\u0026rdquo; he got over the edge of his own boat. Although he was a strong swimmer, he had been in the water for hours, and was nearing exhaustion and a mild case of hypothermia, despite the warm, tropical waters.\nOne good thing about being in the water, thought Daniel to himself, was that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t putting much weight on his broken ankle. It hurt like hell, especially when he was trying to kick, but he wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to let that stop him. He had caught the glint of a shoreline twenty minutes earlier and was expending the last of his rapidly diminishing energy trying to reach it. Once he had made it past the barrier reef, the going was much smoother, and he made significant progress despite his injured leg.\nThe single peak of a slightly smoldering volcano dominated the small island before him. He had no idea where he was, as he had been bound and gagged in the hold of his own ship for several days. Although a slight man, he had always been athletic and adventuresome. His excellent physical condition was the only thing that had allowed him to survive this long. His captors had been a rival drug cartel, and he had been moving various drugs among the South Pacific islands for several years, disguising his efforts as a charter business. While he generally did well with the charters, mostly deep sea fishing, his real money was in drug running. It had all started with an ex-girlfriend, but that was a long time ago and a completely different story. He continued because he needed the money, and running drugs paid good money.\nAh, the price of success, he thought ironically. He had attracted the attention of a new, particularly nasty drug lord who didn\u0026rsquo;t much like independents operating in his area. Daniel, who never liked carrying firearms, was an easy target. He supposed that he should be grateful that the killers wanted the excuse that he had fallen overboard on one of his own charters. That was a laugh! He had thought he was smarter than letting strangers pay cash for a fishing charter in the offseason; why didn\u0026rsquo;t he see that one coming? Feeling that spark of anger helped him push for the beach. Whatever his moral shortcomings, Daniel Sherman was a survivor, and survive he would!\nAt first glance the island looked deserted, but he thought he heard voices, moans and squeals actually. But he was too exhausted to lift his head out of the water for a better look or to listen more carefully, and was about to give up when he felt sand in his hands and dragged himself up onto the beach. He passed out before he realized that he was only twenty yards from a beautiful couple who were making love in the setting sun.\nIt had been about a week since the amazing transformation that had changed Patrick into Patricia, and neither John nor Pat could believe their changed lives. Their island laboratory originally set up secretly to document changes to native species caused by the now forty year old nuclear tests held nearby had now become their island paradise. After nearly three months on the island, they had collected an impressive amount of evidence and made some new scientific discoveries.\nThe most notable had been the one that apparently caused Pat\u0026rsquo;s transformation. A small painted shellfish that lived in all-female harems had a specialized gland that allowed, upon the death or loss of the male, the largest female to change her sex into male and become the leader of harem. Pat had synthesized the secretions to create a healing salve that made short work of any wound they suffered, but it also changed Pat into a woman. Neither man/woman was complaining, however.\nThey had both turned aside thoughts of rescue in the wake of the wonderful new and invigorating relationship they now shared: lovers. Pat reveled in her new gender, and enjoyed the sense of power and sensuousness that her beautiful body gave her. Her new skin was more sensitive than her old, she enjoyed sex, and she seduced John several times a day, not that he needed much seducing. Both were amazed at their stamina and sexual drive, and they attempted to push their bodies to the limits. They hadn\u0026rsquo;t apparently found them yet.\nThis particular day had been much like the five previous ones. They woke in the bed they now shared with one of them instigating sex. This morning it had been John, and Pat had reveled in the long, slow teasing John had inflicted on her body. She awoke to a nuzzling on her breast to discover John suckling her up thrust nipple. Her breasts were magnificent globes of flesh that sat high and proud on her chest. Her nipples had continued to mature after the initial change, and they now were easily a half-inch long, sitting on slightly domed areola, at the end of her D cup breasts. She was almost always erect, and as a former man, she particularly enjoyed the delightful feelings of tightness at least six inches from her ribs. It pleasantly reminded her of a hardon.\nJohn teased first one rosy nipple, then the other as Pat lazed on her back, her breasts rising above her reclined body without any need for support, only slightly sagging off to each side. She wondered how long her new breasts would sit so high, before gravity took over and began to pull them towards the earth. She had no clothes, no bras, and she knew that women couldn\u0026rsquo;t fight gravity forever. For the moment, however, it was an academic question, as John moved slowly down her trim waist, raining gentle kisses over the swell of her womb, along the bony outcroppings of her wide hips, along her silken thighs and down to her toes. She gasped as he sucked a toe into his mouth, and she let her knees fall to each side, exposing her steaming sex to her lover.\nJohn wasted no time working his way back up her legs until he reached her labia, pulling each expanding petal into his mouth while savoring her musky, sweet sent. She was the most beautiful woman he had ever known, and she was insatiable. Pat\u0026rsquo;s hips were now twitching with need, and John refused to make contact with her swollen clitoris. She twined her fingers in his thick, curly hair, urging him to finish her off, cooing and begging. John gave a quick swipe of his tongue up along the joint of her thigh and Venus mound, causing her to whimper in frustration.\n\u0026ldquo;John, don\u0026rsquo;t tease any more \u0026hellip; give it to me,\u0026rdquo; urged Pat. Her right hand reached down and grasped John\u0026rsquo;s hard cock while her left closed over his neck and pulled his face up to her breasts. Up and down the length of John\u0026rsquo;s cock Pat\u0026rsquo;s fingers stroked while she lost herself in the wonderful feelings that John was drawing from her breasts with his lips. She kept trying to push his cock into her twitching cunt, but he held back, denying her.\nPat\u0026rsquo;s long nipple suddenly chilled as John\u0026rsquo;s sucking mouth left it. He slid his hands over her firm smooth legs stopping at the sides of her magnificent butt.\n\u0026ldquo;Anxious aren\u0026rsquo;t we?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Why are you doing this to me?\u0026rdquo; she countered, her breath coming in quick gasps.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps good things will come to those who are patient,\u0026rdquo; he teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Cum indeed, you bastard, \u0026quot; she moaned, \u0026ldquo;stop teasing me!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Relax, let me do it,\u0026rdquo; he promised.\nShe let her thighs fall further apart and placed her hands on John\u0026rsquo;s flanks, waiting for his next move. He held her hands tightly at her sides, and then kissed his way back to her crotch. As John licked and teased her pussy, he let go of her hands and let his fingers begin to stroke over the folds of her labia and probe between the wet lips into the hot tunnel beyond. Pat became more moist and hotter, and John put another finger in next to the first. He finally sucked Pat\u0026rsquo;s swollen clitoris between his lips and tugged on it gently. She gasped in pleasure as a lightening bolt ran through her body. P at lifted off the bed, shaking with her well-deserved orgasm, while John focused on keeping it going as long as possible. He held on for dear life and Pat screamed as her body shook wildly in her release.\nWhen she finally stopped moving, he lifted her knees toward her breasts and spread her thighs. As Pat looked down past her heaving breasts, she had never felt so open and vulnerable. How different from her feelings as Patrick, she thought, and what\u0026rsquo;s more, she loved it! She loved being passive, sexy, and desired. She loved the feeling of ache in her belly as she waited for John to fill the void she now possessed.\nPat sighed contentedly as John closed the distance between his loins and hers. John stroked the tip of his cock up and down the length of Pat\u0026rsquo;s open slit. Each stroke opened the petals of Pat\u0026rsquo;s flowering sex a bit further and smeared her moisture over the head of John\u0026rsquo;s cock. Finally, positioning the head of his cock directly before the opening of her vagina, John applied the beginnings of the slow forward thrust. They both moaned with pleasure at the first passage of the tip of John\u0026rsquo;s cock past the swollen petals of Pat\u0026rsquo;s cunt.\nPat closed her eyes as she savored the still new sensation of the tip of John\u0026rsquo;s cock slipping between her new equipment. More and more open her lower lips were spread as they wrapped themselves around John\u0026rsquo;s big thrusting penis. Further and further her cunt stretched open around the head of John\u0026rsquo;s cock. The ridge of his cock passed beyond the tight ring of her birth canal and the long, hard shaft began to slide into her body.\nPat could feel John\u0026rsquo;s cock as it opened and filled her. It felt so good! John had done his preparatory work well, as usual, and she focused on the magnificent fullness inside her and the incredibly good feeling of her cunt lips rippling back and forth as John\u0026rsquo;s cock moved slowly from the depths of her cunt to a point just barely nestled between her cunt lips and back again.\nJohn focused on the exquisite feelings of Pat\u0026rsquo;s velvety warmth gripping his cock. She was so warm, soft, wet, and snug. Pat clutched his broad shoulders and wrapped her long, sexy legs around John\u0026rsquo;s thrusting hips. As his thrusts became deeper and faster Pat responded with her own more desperate thrusting against John\u0026rsquo;s hard, driving cock. Her breasts rocked and shuddered as John\u0026rsquo;s pile driving piston flew back and forth within her.\nJohn grunted and drove his throbbing cock as far as he could into her, and rounded the corner towards the finish line. Pat, sensing John\u0026rsquo;s imminent release, clamped down even harder with her new muscles, determined to give John the best fucking she could. John reared back suddenly and squirted his release into her. Pat ground her clit against the base of John\u0026rsquo;s cock and felt her second release shudder through her. She cried out as her second orgasm flooded over her carrying her to places she had never dreamed of prior to a few days earlier.\nRelaxing in the afterglow, Pat slowly stroked the back of John\u0026rsquo;s neck, enjoying his weight on her as he lay atop her exhausted by their lovemaking. She felt his deflating prick as it slowly slipped from within her.\nThey were making love for the fourth time that day, on the beach, in the evening sun, when they discovered that they were no longer alone.\nThe sandy-haired stranger on the beach was barely alive, but Pat insisted that they could not use the goop on him.\n\u0026ldquo;John, we don\u0026rsquo;t know what it will do to him,\u0026rdquo; she argued. \u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t take the chance that we will harm another.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But he might die if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something,\u0026rdquo; countered John. \u0026ldquo;The goop made us both the picture of health.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but it also changed me into a woman,\u0026rdquo; Pat reminded him. \u0026ldquo;Not that I\u0026rsquo;m complaining, lover, but he,\u0026rdquo; indicating the unconscious man who lay in Patrick\u0026rsquo;s old bed, \u0026ldquo;might not find the journey to womanhood so enjoyable.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But he is barely alive, and looks like he got several gashes and cuts from the coral reef and either a broken ankle or a real nasty sprain,\u0026rdquo; John insisted. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s at least use it on his injuries.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But even that small amount is what started us on our journey. We can\u0026rsquo;t, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do it,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Some men might consider it a fate worse than death to become a woman, and though I\u0026rsquo;d like to educate them that it\u0026rsquo;s actually quite wonderful, thanks in part to you my darling man, not all men could handle it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s something else,\u0026rdquo; John warned ominously.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Remember how those fish had harems?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not suggesting that you would sacrifice someone else\u0026rsquo;s life to one of your wants?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;No, no \u0026hellip; not that,\u0026rdquo; John slowly stammered. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just \u0026hellip; well, just that I\u0026rsquo;m feeling, I don\u0026rsquo;t know \u0026hellip; aggressive.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aggressive? How do you mean?\u0026rdquo; queried Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;You know that I don\u0026rsquo;t normally like to fight, right?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, though you never shied away from one once you found that it was one of a few limited choices,\u0026rdquo; she admitted.\n\u0026ldquo;I can tell that if he wakes up, I\u0026rsquo;ll have a hard time not being jealous or aggressive \u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t know, because I\u0026rsquo;ve never felt anything like this feeling, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s the goop,\u0026rdquo; John reported.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you serious?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Dead serious,\u0026rdquo; replied John, \u0026ldquo;And I really don\u0026rsquo;t want to hurt him, but with that fish goop running through our veins, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t promise anything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think you have got more human blood than fish goop, but let\u0026rsquo;s set that aside for the moment,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;We have got to find a way to save him without harming him or us.\u0026rdquo;\nPat furrowed her brow in concentration, but the stranger struggling to say something ended the argument.\n\u0026ldquo;Wauuurrhgh,\u0026rdquo; Daniel moaned.\nPat peered down to the stranger\u0026rsquo;s face and examined his features for some signs of life. \u0026ldquo;I think he\u0026rsquo;s trying to say something,\u0026rdquo; she concluded.\n\u0026ldquo;Waddderrrrrr,\u0026rdquo; moaned Daniel.\n\u0026ldquo;What did he say?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Water, I think,\u0026rdquo; replied Pat. \u0026ldquo;Go get some water for him.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn ran to the main hut to get some water while Pat washed the stranger\u0026rsquo;s face with a damp cloth for the tenth time that night. They had quickly lashed together some poles and made a stretcher to carry the unconscious man up to her old room. His breathing was shallow and labored, but he had at least looked better once they had cleaned off the sea and sand. Pat surmised that he was about their age, early thirties, or younger and looked to be in good shape. That had probably saved his life, as he must have been in the water for a long time.\nJohn returned with the water and held it to his lips as Pat cradled the stranger\u0026rsquo;s head in her hands. Daniel sputtered and coughed, but he finally got down some water. After a few minutes and a few more sips of water, he seemed able to speak, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t lift his head from Pat\u0026rsquo;s hands.\n\u0026ldquo;Better \u0026hellip; that\u0026rsquo;s better,\u0026rdquo; Daniel sighed.\n\u0026ldquo;You gave us quite a scare,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;How long?\u0026rdquo; asked Daniel\n\u0026ldquo;How long what? How long were you unconscious?\u0026rdquo; asked John as Daniel turned his barely open eyes towards the sound of another man\u0026rsquo;s voice and nodded slightly. \u0026ldquo;We found you on the beach about five hours ago, brought you back to this hut and cleaned you up a bit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks,\u0026rdquo; said Daniel. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve actually been listening to you for the past half hour, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t let on I was awake because \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because what?\u0026rdquo; demanded Pat feeling offended.\n\u0026ldquo;Because I didn\u0026rsquo;t know if I could trust you,\u0026rdquo; finished Daniel fixing his eyes on John.\n\u0026ldquo;Trust us?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\nDaniel slowly swiveled his eyes back to her. \u0026ldquo;Yea, how do you think I got to your beach, an afternoon swim gone bad?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We really didn\u0026rsquo;t think about it. We were just so surprised to be interrupted,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. John cleared his throat, suddenly. \u0026ldquo;At dinner, interrupted while we were preparing dinner,\u0026rdquo; she corrected herself, blushing.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, don\u0026rsquo;t worry. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember anything after the first fistful of sand I grabbed on the beach,\u0026rdquo; said Daniel. \u0026ldquo;Oh, my name is Daniel. Daniel Sherman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m Pat, and this is John,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;So what is this miracle goop that will make my injuries heal?\u0026rdquo; asked Daniel.\n\u0026ldquo;You heard all that?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, and I can tell you I\u0026rsquo;d take almost anything to ease the pain in my leg right now, even if it changed me into a woman,\u0026rdquo; stated Daniel.\n\u0026ldquo;Does your leg hurt?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that my ankle is broken,\u0026rdquo; stated Daniel.\n\u0026ldquo;I told you so,\u0026rdquo; said John with a smug grin.\n\u0026ldquo;This goop is likely to do more than just heal your injuries,\u0026rdquo; warned Pat. \u0026ldquo;It will likely alter your mind and body, and either you and John will duke it out, or you and I will compete for John\u0026rsquo;s attention, if you know what I mean.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think I understand the risks, and to tell you the truth, I never much liked competing in a man\u0026rsquo;s world anyway. I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be much good at it. Secondly, Daniel Sherman is a dead man one way or the other, and third, my leg is killing me. I\u0026rsquo;m willing to take my chances with the goop,\u0026rdquo; concluded Daniel, finding it harder and harder to talk.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s your choice,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\nJohn had already gone to the adjoining hut to get the goop. He handed it to Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to give you some in a fruit drink we make to disguise the taste, and then put it directly on your cuts and ankle, O.K.?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Fine, but hurry \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m afraid I\u0026rsquo;ll pass out again from the exhaustion and pain,\u0026rdquo; said Daniel.\nHe downed the mixture of goop and punch while Pat dabbed the undiluted goop on his visible cuts and bruises. She lathered a generous amount around his ankle.\n\u0026ldquo;There, that should do it,\u0026rdquo; she stated.\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m \u0026hellip; uuuhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; mumbled Daniel as he fell into unconsciousness.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that takes care of that,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Or, it\u0026rsquo;s just the beginning,\u0026rdquo; said John.\nJohn and Pat were talking over breakfast after checking on their still sleeping guest.\n\u0026ldquo;He didn\u0026rsquo;t change very much, so you were worried for nothing,\u0026rdquo; said John.\n\u0026ldquo;His color looks better, and the swelling in his leg is gone. So, the goop works as advertised even when the injury isn\u0026rsquo;t an external wound or cut,\u0026rdquo; countered Pat. \u0026ldquo;But I didn\u0026rsquo;t change much either, on the outside, at least at first while we were avoiding each other. The first changes were inside my head.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;ll stay away from him while he recovers,\u0026rdquo; offered John, \u0026ldquo;that should help keep things neutral.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We can try, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think that will make a difference,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you angry or jealous that there might be another woman on the island?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but I have enjoyed having you to myself for the past week,\u0026rdquo; Pat said while reaching across their small table to caress John\u0026rsquo;s hardening cock. \u0026ldquo;But since that might be about to change, why don\u0026rsquo;t we take advantage of our guest\u0026rsquo;s nap?\u0026rdquo;\nThey did. Twice. Two hours later Pat finally checked in on Daniel.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, you finally awake?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat as she offered Daniel some water.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, and I can\u0026rsquo;t believe how much better I\u0026rsquo;m feeling. That goop is a miracle drug,\u0026rdquo; said Daniel.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, miracle is right. But I was serious last night about the warning,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;That goop will do more than simply heal you; it will change you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have no idea how much good a change might do me,\u0026rdquo; offered Daniel. He told her of his recent exploits as a charter captain nee drug runner; the glamorous life of a single man with fast money, a fast boat, and lots of fast women, and how all that came to an end when he found himself nearly dead on their beach. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that someone else will discover us here eventually, and word will get around. If Daniel Sherman still lives, I\u0026rsquo;m sure that he won\u0026rsquo;t last for very long. Besides, it was never my idea to be a drug runner, but that \u0026rsquo;s another story.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, the prospect of turning into a woman doesn\u0026rsquo;t frighten you?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;No, not really. Why should it?\u0026rdquo; countered Daniel.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I\u0026rsquo;ve never really thought about it, and I can\u0026rsquo;t say one way or the other how I felt about sex, homosexuality, or women before I changed because I was always so focused on my work. You, however, had quite a love life, boats, women, etc.,\u0026rdquo; mused Pat. \u0026ldquo;You might not be able to keep John at bay.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You might not be able to keep me at bay either,\u0026rdquo; said Daniel.\n\u0026ldquo;You mean you find John attractive already?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I mean that you might not be able to keep me at bay from you,\u0026rdquo; said Daniel with a smile.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you talking about?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Pat, you are one of the most beautiful women I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen, and I don\u0026rsquo;t care if I\u0026rsquo;m a man or a woman, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I could keep my hands off of you,\u0026rdquo; said Daniel forthrightly.\nPat stood, in all her naked glory, in complete and utter silence and shock for a moment. She had never thought of that angle. Sure, she enjoyed her new body, and on the rare occasion that John had been busy spearing their dinner, she had masturbated herself to one of her more intense orgasms yet as a woman. If she enjoyed her own beauty and sensuousness, then why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t she enjoy someone else\u0026rsquo;s?\n\u0026ldquo;The thought has some appeal?\u0026rdquo; asked Daniel.\n\u0026ldquo;Now that you mention it,\u0026rdquo; smiled Pat. \u0026ldquo;But I never had really thought about it before. What about John?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a question you\u0026rsquo;ll have to answer, not me,\u0026rdquo; countered Daniel. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not his lover \u0026hellip; yet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it is me or the effects of the goop, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have a quiver of trouble about thinking about sharing John, especially since there is so much to share,\u0026rdquo; she giggled. \u0026ldquo;In fact, the thought of having another girl around here is giving me a quiver of an entirely different sort! The original fish lived in harems, maybe we should too?\u0026rdquo;\nDaniel smiled. \u0026ldquo;So, when do we start?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Looks to me as though we already have,\u0026rdquo; countered Pat. \u0026ldquo;Your hair is already longer than it was last night, and how are your feeling, you know, sexually?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think it should be pretty obvious by our conversation,\u0026rdquo; offered Daniel. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t think about it until you asked, but I guess that I have been fantasizing about John since I woke up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the goop; there\u0026rsquo;s no avoiding the side effects,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;That will limit its eventual effectiveness if and when we get back to civilization. But at least you knew of the dangers before you took the goop.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps when we get back, you\u0026rsquo;ll find a way to make the healing work without the sex change?\u0026rdquo; asked Daniel.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps. In the meantime, are you feeling up to getting out of bed?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Oddly enough, yes. That goop is amazing,\u0026rdquo; said Daniel.\n\u0026ldquo;Here then, drink up,\u0026rdquo; said Pat offering him a bamboo mug filled with punch and goop. Daniel took the mug, offered her a toast and said, \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s to a new life and some new lovers!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;O.K. Let me try this again,\u0026rdquo; said a very confused John. \u0026ldquo;You want me to dominate you for the next three days and turn you into a woman,\u0026rdquo; he asked Daniel who nodded vigorously, \u0026ldquo;and you are willing to share me with the eventual her,\u0026rdquo; he asked Pat who also nodded vigorously. \u0026ldquo;And if I don\u0026rsquo;t agree, Daniel will walk to the other side of the island and try to stay away from us as much as possible,\u0026rdquo; he finished.\n\u0026ldquo;Right. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to intrude, but fate has thrown us together, and as I\u0026rsquo;ve said to Pat, I could really use a change, a real big change!\u0026rdquo; said Daniel breathlessly. Dan was having a hard time controlling himself. Now that he had made the mental leap to embrace the coming transformation, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how strongly he was attracted to the tall, tanned, and muscled John. He could feel his breathing become shallow and quick, and he was hiding a hard-on beneath what was left of his shorts after his ocean swim. He hoped that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make John uncomfortable.\n\u0026ldquo;I know it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be every guy\u0026rsquo;s fantasy, more than one girl, a deserted island, perfect health, etc., etc.,\u0026rdquo; worried John, \u0026ldquo;but it\u0026rsquo;s never been one of my fantasies.\u0026rdquo;\nPat nudged Daniel a bit closer to John. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not important what your past fantasies were,\u0026rdquo; she argued. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s important is how you feel right now. Is there any chemistry between you and Danni?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Danni?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Danni,\u0026rdquo; said Daniel. \u0026ldquo;I may not look it yet, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to be Danni sooner or later unless I meet a smaller man who I then dominate, which is possible given that most of these South Pacific islanders are shorter than I am.\u0026rdquo;\nPat gave Danni another gentle shove as she watched John\u0026rsquo;s nostrils flare, as Danni got closer. \u0026ldquo;He doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to be a he, he wants to be a she. And I can promise you that I won\u0026rsquo;t be the least bit jealous. I\u0026rsquo;ll always be your first, at any rate. And, when the change is done, Danni and I can be a different kind of first for ourselves and you can watch.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now I know I am dreaming,\u0026rdquo; laughed John.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought you said that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t your fantasy,\u0026rdquo; teased Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;I did, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t, but I AM only human,\u0026rdquo; argued John.\n\u0026ldquo;So, you\u0026rsquo;ll do it?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\nJohn put his arm around Danni and drew him into a hug. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll do it, thought I won\u0026rsquo;t enjoy it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right. Now I know that I\u0026rsquo;m dreaming,\u0026rdquo; laughed Pat.\nDanni, as he decided he would have to call himself to get used to the transition, nearly swooned when John had brought him close. Neither John nor Pat wore any clothes, and Danni had never had his own skin feel like it was afire when pressed to a naked man\u0026rsquo;s chest. The chest his face was crushed against transfixed Danni. It was enormous, hard, and chiseled, lightly dusted with soft, downy tufts of hair that only seemed to highlight the valleys and peaks of John\u0026rsquo;s magnificent chest. John\u0026rsquo;s smell was intoxicating, dark and salty, and his arm felt like an iron bar that held him close and tight. Yes, he was going to like John.\nDanni turned his head so that he could see Pat. She stood laughing with John, her bright green eyes sparkling in the sunlight and her thick auburn hair curling around her pretty face and cascading along her shoulders behind her back with one thick shank curled between her breasts. Her breasts shook with her laughter, bouncing slightly. Danni was equally enthralled with Pat\u0026rsquo;s chest as well. Pat\u0026rsquo;s breasts were large but high, topped with enormous nipples that must have been as big as his fingertips. Well, he thought to himself, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to have any trouble being attracted to either one of them. He hoped that he would be as beautiful as Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;We should head down to the beach and spend the next few days at the old huts,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Why\u0026rsquo;s that?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Because, as wonderful as the end result may be, the process actually hurts a bit,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;Not a lot,\u0026rdquo; she reassured Danni, \u0026ldquo;but being in the water and off your legs helps as your hips and spine reshape themselves into a feminine form.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, well that makes sense,\u0026rdquo; mused Danni. \u0026ldquo;No pain, no gain, after all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, trust me, soon-to-be-little-sister, there is plenty of gain,\u0026rdquo; promised Pat as she gave her own breasts a caress.\nThe three of them spent the entire day at John and Pat\u0026rsquo;s original beach hut, mostly swimming with John going off to spear some fish for meals while Pat showed Danni how to gather shellfish and edible seaweeds. Pat had urged Danni to stay as close to John as often as possible. John felt a bit uneasy at first, but the goop quickly worked its magic, first on their minds, and then on their bodies. Danni seemed to be suffering more physical pain than Pat remembered during her own transition, but Danni distracted himself by admiring Pat\u0026rsquo;s magnificent figure. By the early evening, Danni had progressed to the same state Pat had acquired after her first two months of transition. Danni was not much shorter, having only been about 5'10'' to begin with, but he was much more slender. He had lost most of his male musculature, and his face had softened considerably. With the right tools and the right light, neither of which were on this island, he could easily pass for a woman.\nAs they prepared for their evening meal, they noticed some new developments.\n\u0026ldquo;Pat, have you ever noticed these red patches on John\u0026rsquo;s back?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni as he watched John\u0026rsquo;s back in the firelight as he grilled their meal over the open flame.\n\u0026ldquo;What patches?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat as she left her work on the hut they would sleep in that night and joined Danni who stood behind John.\n\u0026ldquo;See these,\u0026rdquo; she pointed to two long narrow patches of red skin that ran along the inside of John\u0026rsquo;s shoulder blades about 12 inches long.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, I\u0026rsquo;ve never noticed them before,\u0026rdquo; said Pat as she ran her fingers along the length of each mark.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, that tickles,\u0026rdquo; said John.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, sorry. Are they that sensitive?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you tell me?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni as he ran his fingers along the marks he had found on her back.\n\u0026ldquo;Oooooh, careful!\u0026rdquo; Pat squealed. \u0026ldquo;They are sensitive.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you think it is?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, and I can\u0026rsquo;t see in this light,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;Perhaps we will be able to see better in the morning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps we won\u0026rsquo;t need to see better because it be done what ever it is doing,\u0026rdquo; worried John.\n\u0026ldquo;Both of you are taking more goop to assist me in my change, right?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I think the goop needs to be present in all the harem for the transformation to be effective,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe you should stop,\u0026rdquo; said Danni. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want anything bad to happen to you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I knew that I liked her from the start,\u0026rdquo; said John.\n\u0026ldquo;You said \u0026lsquo;her\u0026rsquo; \u0026hellip; wow,\u0026rdquo; said Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, girlfriend, you\u0026rsquo;re getting there,\u0026rdquo; laughed Pat. \u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;ve got two more days until you\u0026rsquo;re done, and we won\u0026rsquo;t let you lie around halfbaked. I\u0026rsquo;m sure that it\u0026rsquo;s not harmful, and I have a theory anyway.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Theory? Well, then let\u0026rsquo;s have it,\u0026rdquo; said John.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s only a theory,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;It was only a theory that got this goop invented in the first place, my beautiful-transformed-genius-lover,\u0026rdquo; teased John.\n\u0026ldquo;O.K. Here it is, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you\u0026rsquo;re going to like it,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought that you said that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad,\u0026rdquo; said John.\n\u0026ldquo;I did say that, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t say that you would or would not like it,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;This is the first time that the two of us have spent the entire day, more or less, in the water, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, but we spent most of the second day at the beach last week when you changed,\u0026rdquo; countered John.\n\u0026ldquo;But when you think about it, we were only in the water for a few hours, whereas today we must have spent eleven or twelve hours in the water, easy,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, and it made me feel so much better, \u0026quot; said Danni. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m getting sore just standing here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You should lie down by the fire,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;We can finish getting dinner ready. So, my possibly-equally-transformed-genius-lover, are you beginning to see where I am going with this theory?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Gills?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Gills,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\nThe three of them sat in stunned silence for a few minutes.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think we are still human?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;It depends on what you mean by human,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s your definition?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;I think we will still be able to produce children with people who haven\u0026rsquo;t had goop, and gills are in our human genetic heritage,\u0026rdquo; continued Pat. \u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t think the ultra conservative religious types will think we\u0026rsquo;re human.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hell, those types don\u0026rsquo;t think that normal people who simply believe different things are human,\u0026rdquo; joked Danni, \u0026ldquo;or ones that have sexual orientations other than straight. Gills will really throw them for a loop.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s almost an academic question since we\u0026rsquo;re still stranded here,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;We should, I think, allow this new twist to continue despite Danni\u0026rsquo;s worries.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, it will be so much easier to fish,\u0026rdquo; laughed John.\n\u0026ldquo;You never seemed to have a problem before,\u0026rdquo; joked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;I wasn\u0026rsquo;t trying to feed three hungry mouths,\u0026rdquo; said John.\nAfter dinner, which had taken Danni three helpings to satiate his unusual appetite and included a healthy dose of goop for everyone, they decided that they would all sleep together on the floor of the hut. Pat had gathered fresh reeds, palm fronds, and made a large bower on the floor. The hut wouldn\u0026rsquo;t keep out much, but it would shield them from the constant, cool breezes the washed in from the cooler water over the still warm land.\nDanni lay down between them, and both Pat and John nuzzled against his neck. He was awash in the tingles and tugs that the goop was performing upon his transforming body. He already had a slight indentation of his waist, and his body hair had largely disappeared. His hips, which had been aching all day, were slightly wider, and his shoulders were slightly narrower. He now looked like a young, slightly androgynous, girl. But both John and Pat could tell he would be beautiful.\nAs they gazed down at the slightly smaller and more petite Danni as he lay between them, they both noted that his hair was a whiter blond at his roots and was now about four inches long. His lips had grown puffier, and his hands and feet were more delicate. Danni was still wearing the remnants of his male shorts, but they weren\u0026rsquo;t going to fit on him/her much longer.\nPat leaned forward and let her breasts brush against Danni\u0026rsquo;s chest as she nibbled on his ear. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going to be a beach blonde,\u0026rdquo; she breathed into his ear.\n\u0026ldquo;That will be nice, one blonde, one redhead,\u0026rdquo; said John as he slowly stroked Danni\u0026rsquo;s flanks with his hands.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;m ready for much past kissing,\u0026rdquo; breathed Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;I know EXACTLY how you feel,\u0026rdquo; teased Pat gently. \u0026ldquo;You can participate when you\u0026rsquo;re ready,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued as she lowered her face to Danni\u0026rsquo;s.\nWhen Pat\u0026rsquo;s soft, full lips gently pressed into his own, Danni knew that he could hardly wait for this journey to be completed. Kissing Pat was unlike any experience he had ever known, in part, because his own lips were larger and softer than they had ever been before. Pat\u0026rsquo;s tongue pried open his lips, and he let her slide her tongue over his teeth, delighting in her scent and taste. Danni wished that his own breasts had already grown so that they could rub sensuously against hers as they hung down from her slender frame, full, heavy, womanly breasts. Soon, he hoped, soon.\nJohn\u0026rsquo;s fingers were doing equally wonderful things to his sides and legs. Danni swore that he could almost feel his waist constrict each time John\u0026rsquo;s fingers danced along his flanks. Pat lifted up from their kiss, her eyes shinning. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going to be a great kisser,\u0026rdquo; she sighed.\n\u0026ldquo;Let me try,\u0026rdquo; said John as he lifted his face from the curve of Danni\u0026rsquo;s softening shoulder.\nDanni caught his breath, turning slowly to John\u0026rsquo;s face looming over his. He knew that he barely looked like a girl, but that he was still very much a man as his cock was straining against his shorts. Pat silenced his worries.\n\u0026ldquo;Oooh, what do we have here?\u0026rdquo; she giggled as she unzipped Danni\u0026rsquo;s shorts and let his stiff, but shrinking, cock spring free. Before Danni could react, John had covered his mouth with his, and Pat had sucked his now much smaller cock into her mouth. Danni nearly passed out with pleasure, feeling the surges of the goop as it swept through his body under the dual assault of Pat and John. On Pat\u0026rsquo;s second stroke, Danni erupted into Pat\u0026rsquo;s mouth, as he moaned into John\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, looks like Danni is on a hair trigger,\u0026rdquo; mused John as he sat up from his kiss. He looked down on the now swooning Danni, noting that his face had shifted even further towards the feminine with longer lashes, wider eyes, and graceful eyebrows. John wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure, but perhaps Danni was moving more quickly than Pat had.\nPat continued to suck and clean Danni\u0026rsquo;s small cock for several minutes while Danni continued to swoon, his eyes closed and arm entwined with John\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I swear I could feel your cock getting smaller in my mouth,\u0026rdquo; mused Pat. \u0026ldquo;Wow, your eyes are really blue!\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed as Danni finally opened his eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Really? That \u0026rsquo;s nice,\u0026rdquo; Danni said as he reached for Pat and pulled her face to his own. \u0026ldquo;Blonde haired and blue eyed, how\u0026rsquo;s that for you John?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t wait,\u0026rdquo; said John as he indicated his throbbing hard-on that was now firmly poking into Danni\u0026rsquo;s slowly feminizing thigh.\n\u0026ldquo;Poor baby, maybe we should help,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;What do you say, Danni?\u0026rdquo;\nDanni looked from Pat\u0026rsquo;s shining hopeful eyes to John\u0026rsquo;s throbbing penis. He knew that the opportunity presented in Pat\u0026rsquo;s suggestion would hurtle him further towards his feminization. But he had only just kissed his first man, and his mind had not yet made the leap to female, though it was certainly getting there in a hurry. Pat scrambled around John and put him in the middle. She put her hips up by John\u0026rsquo;s head and took his large tool lovingly in her small hands.\n\u0026ldquo;Fair is fair,\u0026rdquo; she teased as she twitched her hips with need and lowered her lips over the tip of John\u0026rsquo;s cock and held it there lightly, smiling up at Danni and John.\n\u0026ldquo;I suppose you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; said John with fake annoyance. He shifted away from Danni and turned towards Pat\u0026rsquo;s splayed legs and busied himself in her sweet muff.\n\u0026ldquo;Ummmm, now that\u0026rsquo;s more like it,\u0026rdquo; she cooed as John nipped and licked at her leaking vagina. She took as much of John\u0026rsquo;s cock into her mouth as she could and gave a long, slow pull along its length. John moaned into her crotch.\n\u0026ldquo;You want a taste?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked Danni after John\u0026rsquo;s cock popped from her mouth. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s pretty tasty if you ask me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll just watch this time,\u0026rdquo; said Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;It will speed things up,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;I speak from experience.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure,\u0026rdquo; asked Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Honest to goodness,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\nDanni paused, then sat up and positioned himself opposite Pat as she returned for another long pull on John\u0026rsquo;s magnificent dick. It was thick and long, perhaps eight or nine inches; Danni wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure. At his best, Danni\u0026rsquo;s cock had only been five inches, but no one had ever complained. He had known how to use it properly. Despite his tenuous status as not a woman and no longer quite a man, Danni found John\u0026rsquo;s cock fascinating. It throbbed visibly in Pat\u0026rsquo;s grasp, and her lips stretched over the bell-like head and rippled as they slid over each bump and vein. She lifted her mouth from John\u0026rsquo;s cock with a slight \u0026ldquo;pop\u0026rdquo; and pointed it at Danni\u0026rsquo;s face.\nDanni could feel an odd surging of emotion and tingling as he leaned towards John\u0026rsquo;s cock. He almost didn\u0026rsquo;t register that Pat had let go of the cock and had grabbed John\u0026rsquo;s head in ecstasy, urging him to push her quivering clitoris over the edge and into an orgasm. Danni barely realized that he was holding the cock on his own, or that his lips had gently brushed across the tip, savoring the precum that had oozed out and was dripping down one side. Danni did, however, decide that it was now or never and swallowed John\u0026rsquo;s cock in a forceful thrust that brought a low grunt from John. Pat\u0026rsquo;s hips jumped as John\u0026rsquo;s effort was spurred onward by Danni\u0026rsquo;s sudden enveloping of his cock.\nJohn\u0026rsquo;s cock was tasty; Pat was right. Danni felt a surge of desire and emotion run through her body and soul. Pat was really right! This did speed things up, she realized that she had crossed her own gender barrier in her mind. With a newly inspired vigor and an old and wellearned, knowledge, Danni worked John\u0026rsquo;s cock like a pro. Pat continued to twitch and coo, coming closer and closer to her release. John began grunting with each sudden pump Danni performed on his cock.\nShe moaned into John\u0026rsquo;s crotch, feeling the higher vibrations of her own changed voice flow over both her equally changed teeth, lips, tongue and John\u0026rsquo;s cock firmly lodged in her mouth. Pat finally reached her orgasm, whimpering with joy as wave after wave of pleasure surged through her pelvis and breasts and limbs. Danni sucked even harder, and John found his release too, spurting hot, salty cum into her eager mouth. She felt a sense of satisfaction that she had brought pleasure to some one else, the tangible proof of which she savored in her mouth.\nPat lifted Danni\u0026rsquo;s face to hers and kissed her deeply, sharing the bounty of John\u0026rsquo;s pleasure. Danni eagerly fenced with Pat\u0026rsquo;s tongue and reached for her distended nipple that hung over John\u0026rsquo;s deflating cock. Pat moaned in approval as Danni gently stroked her nipple, extending the still present but now fading pulses of her orgasm.\n\u0026ldquo;See?\u0026rdquo; teased Pat as she broke the kiss.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I see,\u0026rdquo; said Danni, her eyes shining even bluer and her lips fuller.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, it really worked \u0026hellip; you\u0026rsquo;ve crossed over, haven\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes, by God yes!\u0026rdquo; exclaimed Danni. \u0026ldquo;And I love it,\u0026rdquo; she said as she reached up to stroke Pat\u0026rsquo;s beautiful face. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to feel this way this quickly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the goop,\u0026rdquo; replied Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the sleep,\u0026rdquo; grumbled John. \u0026ldquo;Having one sexy woman was tiring enough. Having two will be something entirely different altogether.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Bitch, bitch, bitch,\u0026rdquo; teased Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s put you back into the middle,\u0026rdquo; said Pat as she crawled over the entwined bodies. Danni was jealous of Pat\u0026rsquo;s swaying breasts and large nipples as they brushed over John\u0026rsquo;s waist and then her own still flat chest. Soon \u0026hellip; soon, she thought. Danni and Pat shared gentle caresses and more kisses as John quickly fell asleep next to them.\n\u0026ldquo;Men,\u0026rdquo; whispered Danni with a giggle.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, they have their uses,\u0026rdquo; said Pat as she kissed her newest lover deeply, their tongues twisting and sliding past each other\u0026rsquo;s. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going to need your beauty rest, darling, so let\u0026rsquo;s get some shut eye.\u0026rdquo;\nThey did.\nIn the morning, Danni awoke last and found Pat and John looking at her expectantly.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; she asked sleepily.\n\u0026ldquo;Definitely faster,\u0026rdquo; John observed as Danni sat up and stretched.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, and I\u0026rsquo;m jealous,\u0026rdquo; teased Pat. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s going to be done today at this rate, a full day earlier than I was.\u0026rdquo;\nDanni looked down at herself to see what was the fuss.\nMy god, she thought. Her hair was now past her shoulders and her torso was clearly female. Her rib cage was much smaller, and her nipples were puffy and larger. Her waist seemed to have shrunk in half, while her hips had widened considerably. Her legs were now thin and feminine, and her toes were dainty and perfect!\nPat held out a mug. \u0026ldquo;Here ya go, a nice strong one!\u0026rdquo; she said with a smile.\nDanni took the bamboo mug eagerly and slurped down her morning drink. When she finished, she traded Pat the mug for a small mirror she was holding.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought you might find this useful over the next day or so,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;Though I didn\u0026rsquo;t think you would need this until later today. You\u0026rsquo;re about twelve hours ahead of me, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it is the presence of both John and I or that we are further advanced ourselves or that you might be more sensitive to the compounds in the goop.\u0026rdquo;\nDanni stared in wonder at her reflection in the mirror. Her face was completely changed. Daniel Sherman was gone! Her eyes were bright blue, easily the match of Pat\u0026rsquo;s bright green eyes. Her nose was small, cute, and delicate. Her lips were generous and wide and her teeth were large and strong. She smiled at herself.\n\u0026ldquo;Sort of a cross between Julia Roberts and Jessica Simpson,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, I didn\u0026rsquo;t see that until just now,\u0026rdquo; said John. \u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;re right, only Danni\u0026rsquo;s even prettier than either of them.\u0026rdquo; Danni blushed at John\u0026rsquo;s compliment.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s eat breakfast and hit the beach,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;We can continue this outside.\u0026rdquo;\nAs Danni bent her legs to rise, a ripping sound rent the air. \u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s the end of those shorts,\u0026rdquo; she mused.\n\u0026ldquo;No worries. We go naked and you can too,\u0026rdquo; reassured Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m not done,\u0026rdquo; worried Danni.\nJohn reached down and pulled to her feet. Her formerly male shorts had ripped most of the way down one seam. John grabbed the other seam with both hands and easily ripped the other side of the shorts open from top to bottom. He let the tattered pieces fall to the ground as the three of them looked at the changes to Danni\u0026rsquo;s crotch. She was right, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t done, but no one standing more than three feet away would be able to tell. Nearly all signs of her formerly male appendages were gone. The only remnant was that her clitoris was still looked like a tiny cock, though only about an inch long or less.\n\u0026ldquo;Unless we get new visitors today who get up-close and personal, you\u0026rsquo;ve got nothing to worry about,\u0026rdquo; reassured John.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you convinced me,\u0026rdquo; laughed Danni, and they walked out into the morning sunlight arm in arm.\nThey spent another day in the surf, swimming further out into the lagoon. All three of them felt the effects of the goop on their bodies. Danni\u0026rsquo;s skeleton stopped shifting and hurting by lunchtime, and Pat and John\u0026rsquo;s red marks had grown into red stripes that seemed to be a clearly different texture than the rest of their skin. Their sensitivity had dropped as the change progressed, but nothing else had emerged. Pat insured that all three of them got strong doses of goop with lunch, and they returned to the water.\nLate in the afternoon, after Danni had shared another blowjob with Pat, and then she had suckled Pat\u0026rsquo;s breasts as John stroked Pat \u0026gt;from behind while they all floated in the shallow lagoon, Danni felt a tugging in her abdomen and moaned in discomfort.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s o.k. honey,\u0026rdquo; reassured Pat. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s your womb forming. You\u0026rsquo;re almost there. Heck, your breasts are coming in faster than mine did,\u0026rdquo; she observed as she noted Danni\u0026rsquo;s expanding nipples and gentle slopes of her newly formed breasts.\nDanni leaned back in the water as John supported her so she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t sink. She could feel her insides rapidly reshuffling themselves into her new sex, and the anticipation she felt helped offset the sharp ache that lanced through her stomach and groin. John stroked her sides, holding her hips at water level while Pat supported her head between her breasts, stroking her hair. Danni was comforted by the weight on her chest that signaled the arrival of her breasts, though they were still only about a B cup, they nevertheless stuck straight up into the warm, early evening air, gently caressed by the waves as they lapped over her breasts and stomach. Her nipples were already long and stiff, and her bright, blond hair floated in a halo around her shoulders and face.\nThe discomfort lasted for almost a half hour, but the result was astonishing. The water that had been washing over her chest now could no longer reach her nipples. Her breasts had expanded even as her womb had formed. Danni now looked down from where her head was cradled in between Pat\u0026rsquo;s large breasts. She could see that her own body\u0026rsquo;s terrain had greatly changed. Her new breasts were not as large as Pat\u0026rsquo;s, it seemed, but the nipples were very stiff and very sensitive. The warm salt water barely lapped at the sides of her bulging breasts, ebbed, and flowed over her completed vagina. Her hips had widened to the equal of Pat\u0026rsquo;s, and her legs were smooth and long. Her vagina was topped with the barest tuft of white blond hair, and she could feel the dull ache of desire in her womb rather than the sharp pain of transformation. She was ready.\nShe looked back at Pat who had gently held her head above the water for so long, and parted her lips in anticipation of a kiss. Pat did not disappoint her, and she lowered her full, soft lips to Danni\u0026rsquo;s wide, soft mouth. Their tongues dueled while Pat\u0026rsquo;s hands wandered over Danni\u0026rsquo;s breasts, plucking at her stiff and long nipples.\n\u0026ldquo;I think the oven is done,\u0026rdquo; observed Pat after she broke off the kiss from Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s stick a fork in her and see,\u0026rdquo; teased John.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you dare stick a fork in me,\u0026rdquo; warned Danni. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s only one instrument I\u0026rsquo;m willing to accept into my body.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just one?\u0026rdquo; breathed Pat as she thrust her long tongue deep into Danni\u0026rsquo;s mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;Yummmmm, \u0026quot; moaned Danni. \u0026ldquo;Well, maybe more than one, but definitely not a fork.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Would a nice hard prick do?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, as a matter of fact, I think it would do nicely,\u0026rdquo; said Danni as she rose from Pat\u0026rsquo;s embrace.\nJohn let Danni\u0026rsquo;s hips sink into water in which he was standing and guided Danni as she turned to float vertically in the water next to him.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m feeling water logged, and I want a better look at the final product,\u0026rdquo; said Danni as she turned and stroked for the shoreline. John and Pat watched appreciatively as Danni\u0026rsquo;s shapely ass broke the waterline and swayed back and forth with Danni\u0026rsquo;s powerful strokes towards the beach.\n\u0026ldquo;Last one in gets one less kiss,\u0026rdquo; laughed Pat as she followed Danni\u0026rsquo;s lead and headed for the hut. John watched in awe as two of the most shapely women he had ever seen, neither of whom had been women for very long, gave perfect Ester Williams' imitations and put feminine charms in water on perfect display. He wasted no time following both of them into the shore.\nDanni reached the same shore she had only two nights earlier barely dragged (himself) onto, and strode with strong, swaying strides towards the hut that sat at the edge of the high tide line. She paid particular attention to her body, as it broke free of the water\u0026rsquo;s support for the first time. Her breasts where almost as large as Pat\u0026rsquo;s, but Danni was particularly glad that her nipples were larger and poked out from perfectly Champaign glass shaped, C cup breasts. Her breasts felt heavy on her chest, with just the right amount of jiggle. Her waist was thinner than Pat\u0026rsquo;s, which she felt proud of, and her hips were generous without being too much of a good thing. She was nearly the same height as Pat, she noted as Pat strode out of the waves and walked towards her, her larger breasts rocking and swaying with her strides. Pat was a redhead, well, auburn at any rate, and Danni was a classic blonde. They made good bookends \u0026hellip; or John-ends \u0026hellip; she thought with a giggle.\nPat took in the vision of loveliness that stood in the dusk on the beach before her. Danni had turned out spectacularly. Danni was more petite than she was, but that did not worry her, as she knew that balance was more important than uniformity. She stood close to Danni and took her into her arms.\nThe kiss that Danni shared with Pat was the most electric kiss she had every known, man or woman as either man or woman.\n\u0026ldquo;Look at your nipples,\u0026rdquo; Pat teased. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re so excited that they\u0026rsquo;re sticking out an inch!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So are yours,\u0026rdquo; Danni returned.\n\u0026ldquo;Not an inch,\u0026rdquo; she laughed. \u0026ldquo;Well, what are we going to do about it?\u0026rdquo;\nDanni shrugged with a coy smile. A second later, Danni felt Pat\u0026rsquo;s hand move from around her neck and start stroking Danni\u0026rsquo;s thigh. Never in a thousand years could she have imagined that she would ever be a woman while another woman stimulated her sexually. Pat\u0026rsquo;s hand snaked its way to Danni\u0026rsquo;s wet crotch and she gasped with pleasure. She moved her own hand to Pat\u0026rsquo;s equally wet pussy, and they stood there, their nipples brushing past each other, as they slowly stroked each other\u0026rsquo;s pussy lips, cooing and sighing with the pleasure that they shared. They continued stroking each other as John walked from the water and stood, cock at full mast, watching their lovemaking.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get to the hut,\u0026rdquo; breathed Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, lets,\u0026rdquo; agreed Danni.\nDanni was no sooner in the hut when Pat pulled her into her arms and kissed her. She felt Pat\u0026rsquo;s tongue enter her mouth and quickly slid her own out to meet it. Pat\u0026rsquo;s hand quickly moved down Danni\u0026rsquo;s gracefully curving back and slid down the back of her ass. Danni responded by pulling on Pat\u0026rsquo;s nipples that were crushed between them.\nPat\u0026rsquo;s breasts were heavier than Danni\u0026rsquo;s, the nipples were rounder but not longer. Pat moaned into Danni\u0026rsquo;s open mouth as Danni fondled her nipples. Danni\u0026rsquo;s hand slid down to her hips and pulled Pat closer, working a thigh between her legs. She felt, for the first time, the cooling sensation of pussy juice dripping down on their legs. Danni wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if it was more her than Pat, but both of their vaginas were making squishy sounds as they humped each other\u0026rsquo;s legs.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go in to the bed,\u0026rdquo; Pat whispered as she pulled away from Danni. \u0026ldquo;John can join us in a bit,\u0026rdquo; she continued with a wink to John.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about me,\u0026rdquo; said John. \u0026ldquo;I could use the rest. I\u0026rsquo;ll be ready for you when you two are ready for me.\u0026rdquo;\nDanni released Pat reluctantly and followed her into the bed. In the soft glow of the moonlight, they looked at each other. Two new women who were each aglow with their new found femininity.\nTheir pubic hairs were both lightly colored and gently curled, proof that they were both naturals. Small clear droplets of cum clung to their mounds.\nPat licked her finger and then traced up and down the center of Danni\u0026rsquo;s bush. Her gaze was as exciting to Danni as the wet finger between her legs. Unable to wait any longer, Danni took hold of Pat and pulled her to the bower of reeds and palm fronds. It felt like a feather bed to the lovers.\nThey rolled back and forth, blonde and redhead, kissing deeply, nipples rubbing together, bellies touching and mounds grinding together. When Danni was on top, Pat slid her hands down her back and pulled hard against her. The other did the same as their positions changed. Danni then remembered a trick she saw once in a porno when she was still a man. She pulled Pat\u0026rsquo;s plump cheeks apart, and then pushed them back together, rhythmically. Then she used her fingertips to tease her puckered anus. Pat moaned at the touch.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026hellip;.Oh yes\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she gasped. \u0026ldquo;It feels so good.\u0026rdquo;\nNeeding no more encouragement, Danni got up, knelt behind Pat, and teased her again. First with her fingers, then with her tongue. Danni buried it deep in Pat\u0026rsquo;s rectum while she pumped two fingers in and out of her dripping pussy.\nThe incredible sight of Pat on all fours entranced John, her breasts swaying back and forth as she rocked back into Danni, who had her head buried in Pat\u0026rsquo;s ass while her fingers pumped her wet pussy. John resisted the temptation to stroke his own cock, content to wait until it was his turn.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s it,\u0026rdquo; Pat hissed, as she rocked back and forth. \u0026ldquo;So good! So damn good!\u0026rdquo;\nHearing Pat talk like that helped push Danni closer to the edge, but she was determined to hold back a little longer. She knew Pat was close, but she wanted it to build to a rousing climax. A few minutes later, she felt Pat\u0026rsquo;s rectum clamp down on her tongue as her pussy pulsed around her fingers. She plunged her mouth into Pat\u0026rsquo;s box and was rewarded a second later with an explosion of cum which saturated her face.\nDanni hardly had time to recover her composure before Pat had recovered and maneuvered Danni onto her back. Immediately Pat had her face between Danni\u0026rsquo;s legs and went to work on her. Danni couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe how she felt! Her breasts jumped on her rib cage as her hips twitched at Pat\u0026rsquo;s probing tongue. Her body felt alive with pleasure, and her hair softly caressed her shoulders and arms. She felt so female, so soft and pretty, and so close to an orgasm. Pat\u0026rsquo;s head bobbed up and down as she tongued Danni closer and closer to her first female orgasm. Suddenly John reached over and began to stroke her breasts while Pat continued her assault on her cunt.\nThe dam broke, the clouds parted, the storm broke, and Danni experienced the singular pleasures of the female orgasm. It started with a white-hot surge through her abdomen that sent tendrils of pleasure to all her extremities, but most especially to her clit and nipples. The resulting aftershock as that pleasure coursed back towards her womb set off the explosion of a lifetime. Danni never felt such wonder, such power, and such passion. She clasped John to her breast and thrust her hips into Pat\u0026rsquo;s eager embrace, screaming in pleasure, pulsing, pulsing, and pulsing.\nPat held on for dear life as she tongued Danni through one orgasm after another. Danni didn\u0026rsquo;t know it was possible to cum so much. Pat seemed insatiable, unwilling to break contact with the woman that she had helped to create. John was equally helpful, suckling the long and stiff nipple that rose from Danni\u0026rsquo;s heaving and quivering breast.\nFinally, Danni could take no more and managed to pull Pat up from her jellied thighs and guide her face to her own. Danni kissed her, and then they spent long minutes licking cum off each other\u0026rsquo;s faces, before John finally joined in to help them.\n\u0026ldquo;That was wonderful,\u0026rdquo; sighed Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;That was only the start,\u0026rdquo; teased Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you talking about?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine more pleasure than that!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t you forgetting someone?\u0026rdquo; teased Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, John,\u0026rdquo; said Danni as she turned to face him. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d completely forgotten about you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not to worry,\u0026rdquo; teased John. \u0026ldquo;I hadn\u0026rsquo;t forgotten about you!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we have left you in quite a state,\u0026rdquo; she said with a conspiratorial smile to Pat. \u0026ldquo;And now, I have ALL the equipment needed to take care of that,\u0026rdquo; Danni as she leaned forward and took his hard cock into her mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh!\u0026rdquo; John exclaimed as he felt the warm softness engulf his cock. He focused on the ripples of delight produced by Danni\u0026rsquo;s skillful tongue. If anything, his cock had grown even harder as he looked down and watched those soft red, feminine lips he had seen develop for the last two days now slide up and down his manhood.\nDanni was a born cocksucker. With a skill that normally came from years of practice, she took John\u0026rsquo;s nine inches deep into her throat. John had only had a few blowjobs before. None of those had felt like this, not even Pat\u0026rsquo;s.\nThe wetness of Danni\u0026rsquo;s mouth seemed to engulf his entire being. Her tongue was everywhere at once; licking up under the crown, tickling the sensitive area beneath his balls, massaging the sides of his cock as she took him all the way into her throat.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh Danni \u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; He moaned. John placed his hands against the back of Danni\u0026rsquo;s head and began to thrust his cock into her mouth, worried that he would release too soon. He needn\u0026rsquo;t have worried. Danni expertly held his balls with her free hand, delaying his climax. She could feel the fire building inside him, and knew exactly what John felt, and knew she could control it. It felt so good to have such power and insight.\nFinally, she released her grip and Danni felt the first drops of hot cum splatter against the back of her mouth. Furiously pumping his cock with her hand, she opened wider and swallowed as much of John as she could. The salty white fluid filled her as she closed her eyes and savored the tangy taste.\nIt seemed like it would never end as he erupted a third and then a fourth time. The last burst as powerful as the first. Finally, the fifth spurt signaled the end as Danni slowed the motion of her head and gently began to lick the length of his cock clean.\nShe took a final lick of his now softening cock and let it slip from her mouth. She looked up at him, a very satisfied smile on her face.\n\u0026ldquo;Did you enjoy that?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked as she stood up.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh yes,\u0026rdquo; John said as she reached her full height.\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; she purred like a cat that had just finished a saucer of milk.\n\u0026ldquo;That was hot,\u0026rdquo; said Pat as she reclined on their bower.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not finished,\u0026rdquo; said Danni as she pressed her lips against John\u0026rsquo;s, giving him a passionate kiss. The taste of his juices was still on her lips and when she reached into his mouth with her tongue, he sampled an even larger measure. She then broke away from John, and began to display herself to her two lovers.\nJohn watched as Danni began to caress her beautiful body, sensuously displaying herself. She caressed her very large nipples and teased her already swollen labia.\n\u0026ldquo;You can take a closer look now that they are finished,\u0026rdquo; Danni said as she smiled and ran her fingers across her tits. \u0026ldquo;Touch them \u0026hellip; kiss them,\u0026rdquo; she urged.\nThat did it for John. He could already feel his cock springing back to life. John cupped both breasts and moved his mouth to the closest nipple. He heard Danni sigh as he took it into his mouth and began to gently suck it. If it was one thing he had learned from Pat, it was how to suck a woman\u0026rsquo;s breasts.\nHis tongue traced the outline of her aureole as his fingers massaged her other breast. He could feel the nipple growing harder in his mouth as he covered it with his warm saliva. He eased Danni onto the bower of palm fronds and began to kiss and lick his way across her chest until he came to her other nipple where he repeated his performance. Danni just laid back and closed her eyes, a happy smile beaming across her face.\n\u0026ldquo;Ummm, breasts are nice.\u0026rdquo; She murmured. \u0026ldquo;But I need to be fucked. I want you to fuck me hard!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hard?\u0026rdquo; John repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; She continued as he again took a breast in each hand and massaged them. \u0026ldquo;I want you to make me feel like a woman!\u0026rdquo;\nJohn wasted no time in fulfilling her request. He eased her up onto on all fours. Taking a position behind her, John stroked his hard cock as he rubbed his cockhead against Danni\u0026rsquo;s wet hole. As he rubbed his maleness up and down the length of her opening, Danni pressed her pelvis against his hardness, inviting him to enter her.\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck me!\u0026rdquo; Danni cried out as she pressed against him. \u0026ldquo;I need you inside me so bad!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Give it to her, John!\u0026rdquo; urged Pat. \u0026ldquo;God, you\u0026rsquo;re such a tease, trust me girl, I know.\u0026rdquo; Pat squirmed under the two lovers and positioned her mouth beneath their union, offering her still quivering cunt to Danni.\nJohn thrust forward and burst effortlessly past Danni' virginity and slid inside of her. As wonderful as Pat\u0026rsquo;s mouth had felt on Danni\u0026rsquo;s clit, it was nothing compared to the fullness that now pressed against her maidenhead. John gripped her hips firmly and began to develop his rhythm, one that Danni quickly matched, timing her gyrations to meet his forward thrusts. As the forward thrust of John\u0026rsquo;s thrusts forced Danni forward, she leaned into Pat\u0026rsquo;s waiting quim and shared the pleasure she was feeling from John with Pat.\nPat was tighter, but Danni was wetter, thought John as he savored their intense love making.\n\u0026ldquo;Harder,\u0026rdquo; moaned Danni urging John forward.\nThe pace quickened and John\u0026rsquo;s thrusts became more insistent, each drive seeming to penetrate deeper than the last. Danni thrilled to the feelings as John slid his rock hardness almost all the way out, then pushed forward in a furious thrust until his balls slapped against her. She could feel her ass shake with each thrust and her breasts quivered wildly on her chest; her nipples were twin points of fire. Her mouth was crushed against Pat\u0026rsquo;s cunt with each thrust.\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck me, fuck me!\u0026rdquo; Danni panted as her sweat-covered body quaked in passion. \u0026ldquo;Fill me with your cock!\u0026rdquo;\nEven though he had just cum only minutes previously, John knew he would soon erupt again. His own body was also covered with sweat, his breath labored under his efforts.\nSo wet had Danni\u0026rsquo;s love canal become and so intense had John\u0026rsquo;s thrusts become, the he had slipped out of her more than a few times. He usually thrust back within her before she could even notice. This time he pulled out deliberately.\nIn her sexual ecstasy, it was several seconds before Danni realized that John was no longer within her. A look of lust and need filled her face as she began to turn her head and look over her shoulder to see what had happened. She was so close to what she knew would be a truly awesome climax - he couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop now. To her relief, John was already guiding his wonderful cock back to her womanhood.\nNo sooner had she turned her head forward again, Danni felt the sudden pressure against her vulva as Pat pulled her face back to her own steaming snatch. Danni moaned her appreciation as John\u0026rsquo;s highly lubricated cock filled her again, while Pat matched her as Danni\u0026rsquo;s tongue flicked against her clit. Pat reached down to play with Danni\u0026rsquo;s hanging breasts as Danni slipped further and further towards a maelstrom of pleasure.\nJohn only lasted a few strokes more before he felt a white-hot orgasm erupt from his toes through his thighs and out through his cock into Danni. The splash of hot cum on her cervix, coupled with Pat\u0026rsquo;s ministrations of her body, pushed Danni over the edge. Her body quaked and bucked like a boat in a storm. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t manage words; a few animalistic grunts were all that flowed from her. Even in the movies, neither John nor Pat had ever seen a woman climax like that. Pat was immediately swept up in the waves of pleasure and came again herself, matching Danni\u0026rsquo;s quaking, quivering body.\nFinally, Danni dropped to the floor, her energy spent. Feeling a little weak himself, John dropped down and lay next to her. Pat cuddled up against John\u0026rsquo;s free side.\nIt was ten minutes before any one spoke. Danni finally opened her eyes and looked at John. \u0026ldquo;Thank you,\u0026rdquo; she said softly. \u0026ldquo;Thank you both.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I believe that the expression is, entirely my pleasure, miss, happy to serve,\u0026rdquo; teased John.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, this is going to be fun,\u0026rdquo; said Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Pat, you were right,\u0026rdquo; sighed Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Right about what?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;The benefits of the benefits far outweigh the pains of the transformation,\u0026rdquo; concluded Danni. \u0026ldquo;Who would have believed that being a woman was this much pleasure?\u0026rdquo;\n03 - A Mermaid\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Tale\u0026rdquo; Danni had been the first to discover that she was actually using her gills. A few weeks after her transformation from a guy, who had been left for dead by drug thugs, into a beautiful blonde woman living in paradise, she too had developed the same red patches of skin on her back as those on Pat and John. Now, several months later, Danni was floating in the lagoon after a long lesson in tropical flora and fauna from Pat. Pat, who was formerly a male bio-chemical scientist but now was a beautiful woman as well, had grilled her endlessly on edible fish, shellfish, and plants.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s for your survival,\u0026rdquo; pleaded Pat as she warned Danni about poisonous sea creatures. \u0026ldquo;The reef protects us, and most of these fish, from the larger predators, but there is still plenty of danger here without sharks. John will never forgive me if something happened to you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Mom,\u0026rdquo; teased Danni as she stretched away her mid-day fatigue.\nPat gazed with open admiration at Danni\u0026rsquo;s shapely torso as she arched into her stretch; Danni\u0026rsquo;s full breasts with their unusually long nipples, and her sparse patch of white blonde hair atop her still new pussy set within her generously wide hips. The goop that Pat had distilled from the glands of a gender changing fish had not only changed their own gender but had also made them incredibly healthy and immune to common hurts, even sunburn. The result was that the three of them spent more time at the beach then in the forest, and they had become golden brown from head to toe.\nPat savored her own changes even as she admired Danni\u0026rsquo;s. She loved the flow of the warm water over her body, around her delicate limbs, between her naked thighs; she enjoyed the occasional tug on her labia as her slowly scissoring legs that kept her afloat forced the warm water to rush between her legs. Pat compared her own full breasts as they bobbed horizontally in the water to Danni\u0026rsquo;s twin peaks that were currently pointing towards the sun. Pat concentrated on the waves as they pulled and pushed against her own chest, offering her both a physical and a visual reminder of her dramatically changed status.\n\u0026ldquo;You remember all the hand signals?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, tolerating her designation of \u0026ldquo;Mom\u0026rdquo; even they were both, more or less, biologically the same age of early twenties.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, at least I remember all those, even if I can\u0026rsquo;t recognize all those fish and conchs and stuff,\u0026rdquo; Danni assured, ending with a little spout of water playfully directed at Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with a gentle swat on Danni\u0026rsquo;s arm to get her to head for the bottom.\nDanni smiled at Pat and signaled the \u0026ldquo;just a minute\u0026rdquo; sign, and floated for a minute more, resting atop the warm, tropical water, feeling the small waves lap at her body like a lover. She loved the feeling her new body gave her. The water swelled in the delicate hallow of her waist, focusing attention on her dramatically smaller torso as it swept out into generous hips that supported a classic \u0026ldquo;bubble butt.\u0026rdquo; She loved the feeling of displacement that her \u0026ldquo;thorax\u0026rdquo; gave her, the weight and movement of her hips and thighs. She closed her eyes, feeling the warm sun, the warm water, the cooling breeze as it stiffened her nipples atop the wobbling weight of her breasts. She loved the different stimulations of the warm water lapping at the sides of her bulging tits, the water caressing and cresting over her nipples several inches above the surface of the water. With each passing crest of water, her nipples were again subjected to the alternating stimulation of warm water and cooling breeze. The delicious tightness of her nipples almost prompted her to reach up to twist one.\nInstead, she allowed her crinkling nipples to remind her of waking up that morning with both John and Pat nibbling on her long nipples, which had made her womb clench with need, aching for something to fill it up, over and over and over again. John had valiantly fulfilled that need, over and over again, until Danni had orgasmed over and over again. Then Danni and John had turned their attention to Pat, who was left gasping and helpless under their combined assault. John was already up to two orgasms himself, and they hadn\u0026rsquo;t even had breakfast.\nDanni gave into the warm memories of the last several months, recalling how the three of them grew closer and closer. She had never loved anyone, really, and now she loved these two with a fierceness that surprised her. She and Pat had become more than sexual partners, they had become sister-wives to the every attentive and every ready John. One surprise had been their periods. The first one had been three days of hell, and for some reason the girls were perfectly synchronized. They were better prepared for the second, which occurred about a month later, but both women had been surprised by the rich bond they had formed through this penultimate female experience. Even John had noticed the difference.\nShellfish. Right. Damn it.\nDanni took a deep breath ignoring the continual horniness her body gave her and turned in the water, pulling herself toward the bottom, about twenty meters down, with languid but strong strokes of her arms and legs. The warm water was crystal clear and teeming with life. Her own now longer hair floated behind her, caressing her shoulders and back in a golden silkiness as she lazily stroked towards the bottom. A glance behind her saw the beautiful outline of Pat treading water above, her shapely legs scissoring slowly, her slender waist turning and twisting as her generous hips anchored the eggbeater kicks that kept her afloat. Pat\u0026rsquo;s own rich auburn hair was even thicker and longer than Danni\u0026rsquo;s, and floated along the surface of the water like lace. Danni paused on her way down to admire the flashing tuft of hair in Pat\u0026rsquo;s crotch as she kept herself afloat. With an internal sigh, Danni turned again towards the bottom, trying to find the conch that Pat had assured her would be safe to eat. She was at the bottom now, floating easily, her breath comfortably held.\nShe wasn\u0026rsquo;t recognizing anything. Danni searched and searched, not paying attention to the time. She didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything was unusual until she felt a frantic pulling on her shoulder. She turned and saw a very upset Pat, trying to get her attention. Pat gestured towards her arm, as though she was pointing at a wristwatch that neither woman now possessed. Danni grinned and nodded her head, giving Pat a thumbs up: she was doing fine.\nPat gaped. Well, she gaped as much as she could while still trying to hold her breath. They had all been improving at holding their breaths for longer and longer periods, but this was astounding. By Pat\u0026rsquo;s rough estimate, Danni had been down for over ten minutes and was showing no signs of discomfort. Pat flashed her the sign for ten minutes.\nDanni gaped. Well, she gaped as much as she could while exhaling nearly half her breath. Ten minutes! No way, there was no possible way! She felt like she just got started, a minute or two at most! She took stock of her self, her chest, and her alertness. She felt great, and even felt fine with half her air gone. She signaled that Pat should wait, and held out her hand.\nPat looked carefully at Danni, noting that she was alert, her eyes were bright and active, and that there was no sluggishness in her limbs. She carefully took Danni\u0026rsquo;s hand, and together they began to count.\n1, 2, 3, \u0026hellip; 18, 19, 20 \u0026hellip; 155, 156, 157 \u0026hellip; at the second ten minute mark, Danni was still smiling, relaxed, and easily holding her breath. Pat too was feeling fine, and she gently turned Danni around as they continued to hold hands, floating effortlessly twenty meters below the surface. As Danni\u0026rsquo;s back came into view, Pat could see that the red areas of skin that had previously looked like a rash were now raised slightly, sticking into the water like Velcro, and obviously were now working gills of some sort. She pulled Danni back to facing her, and indicated she should look at her back.\nAs Pat slowly turned in the water, Danni suspected what she would find, the red patches of skin on each of their backs had previously been merely a strange roughness, like a rash. Now, hundreds of tiny little fronds were raised into the water, exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide, and allowing them to \u0026ldquo;breathe\u0026rdquo; under water.\nPat slowly turned back around, and they both looked at each other with surprise and awe as what they were doing slowly sank into their consciousness. They had lost count of the time, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter. They weren\u0026rsquo;t going to surface until they had to. By mutual agreement, they both settled in to see how long they could hold out.\nFour hours later, John was frantically calling out for Pat and Danni. He knew that they had gone to the lagoon to collect food, but he thought they would have been back within the hour. He was pretty sure they hadn\u0026rsquo;t gone deeper into the jungle, and he knew they hadn\u0026rsquo;t gone up to the hot tub that was slightly higher up the mountainside than their second camp, the original beach camp having been restored to use after being damaged in a tsunami. He had waited for nearly two hours, and then set out in search of them. Although the island was remote and small, he worried that something may have happened. After all, several months ago Daniel, now Danni, had shown up unexpectedly. Someone may have arrived on the island and the girls could be in danger.\nJohn\u0026rsquo;s fish-goop altered physique easily withstood the grueling punishment he inflicted upon himself for nearly two hours, running the length of all their known trails into the jungle, and then circumnavigating their small island entirely. His fervor surprised him. He knew that they three of them had formed a very close bond, but the ache in his chest was something new. He HAD to find his girls. He was now looking out over their small lagoon, which was nevertheless several hundred square kilometers of water, reef, and sand. He plunged into the water and started swimming.\nAfter the first hour or so, the girls realized that simply floating ten meters down wasn\u0026rsquo;t very much effort, and that they could probably keep that up indefinitely. Pat signaled that they should swim around, giving the \u0026ldquo;O.K.\u0026rdquo; sign every so often, and that they should stay close to one another.\nAfter nearly three hours of exploring the lagoon, they were still submerged, still \u0026ldquo;holding\u0026rdquo; their original breath. The afternoon sun dappled the coral and fish all around them, playing across their skin and hair. As Pat signaled that they should rest for a bit in a natural sand bowl among the many outcroppings of coral, Danni could not help but notice how beautiful Pat was as she gracefully sank towards to the bottom.\nDanni drank in Pat\u0026rsquo;s beauty as she twirled gently the last few meters down to the sand. Pat\u0026rsquo;s auburn hair glistened and sparkled in the water and sun, floating like a halo around her head. Her large breasts, normally high and firm on Pat\u0026rsquo;s rib cage, were now floating, up thrust, in the water, each tipped by thumb sized nipples thrusting upward from the middle of generous, dome shaped areolas. Her waist sloped dramatically from her slim shoulders, making her seem as though she might break in half. From her slender waist the gentle slope of her tummy smoothed out towards her wide hips, and her heart shaped ass was firm and taut in the water, and the two dimples above each ass cheek still turned Danni on in ways she couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand. Finally, Danni drank in Pat\u0026rsquo;s long legs that were gracefully extended like a ballerina\u0026rsquo;s as Pat twirled slowly to rest her tiptoes on the sandy bottom.\nDanni looked down at her own breasts, also floating up thrust in the dappled light of nearly twenty meters of salt water as she floated down towards Pat. Her own nipples weren\u0026rsquo;t as thick as Pat\u0026rsquo;s, but they were nearly half again as long, almost an inch. She pushed gently against the water with her hands, moving her body so that she settled next to Pat only a few inches apart. Pat\u0026rsquo;s eyes were shining with mutual lust and love as Danni inched forward her.\nPat reached for her, but Danni shook her head and signaled that Pat should wait. She followed Danni\u0026rsquo;s eyes to her own breasts, where Danni was slowly, ever so gently pushing their two bodies towards one another. Pat realized that their breasts would touch while their flat stomachs, shapely hips, and that the rest of their bodies were still a foot apart. The two \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; women both loved their breasts, and this sort of play was one of their favorite activities. Normally, one of them would hold herself above the other, usually while John was either licking or fucking one of them, dragging her breasts across the other\u0026rsquo;s. This was different, in that they were both floating and waiting for that delicious first touch, both equally free and swaying in the water.\nPat realized that her nipples were as hard with anticipation as they had ever been, and she could see that Danni\u0026rsquo;s long nipples were equally hard with excitement. The tension in her breasts caused pleasant tremors to ripple through her body, redoubled as she felt the first, whisper touch of their nipples as they glided across one another\u0026rsquo;s breasts.\nPat felt herself experience a sharp intake of breath. How could that be, she barely asked herself, here under the water, as she felt Danni\u0026rsquo;s torso twist slightly so that their nipples dragged across one another\u0026rsquo;s in the other direction. She exhaled into the sea, moaning with pleasure, but felt no emptiness in her lungs.\nDanni exhaled at the same time, her body convulsing with the sexual tension they had created. She too felt no emptiness, and felt air slowly, but steadily re-filling her lungs. Within seconds, she felt a full breath within her chest, which had expanded back out, pushing their breasts together again. Danni tried an experiment.\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; she gurgled into the sea, smiling at her lover, as she ground her breasts against Pat\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat replied, surprised at their experiment.\nAs the bubbles rose, they watched one another to see if they needed to surface. Both signaled that they were fine, and then they reached for one another and crushed their bodies together in a kiss that entwined all their limbs, tongues, and even their hair. They continued to frantically kiss and nip at each other\u0026rsquo;s lips, noses, ears, and necks as their limbs stayed entwined in a fierce embrace unencumbered by gravity or position. Their moans were now nearly constant.\n\u0026ldquo;I love you,\u0026rdquo; Pat whispered into Danni\u0026rsquo;s ear in between kisses and moans.\n\u0026ldquo;I love you too,\u0026rdquo; Danni joyfully replied as the bubbles rose around them and their hips found a steady rhythm as they pressed their vulvas into each other\u0026rsquo;s thighs and hipbones.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my \u0026hellip; I really love this,\u0026rdquo; groaned Danni as Pat grabbed her ass and applied even more force to their under water humping. Danni concentrated on the rhythmic pressures that Pat\u0026rsquo;s beautiful body created in her own. The heat of their vaginas pressed against one another\u0026rsquo;s thighs, their breasts, full and soft, squeezing past, through, and on each other\u0026rsquo;s. The press of their fingers on flesh, thigh, and hip, as they each urged the other towards climaxes.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,\u0026rdquo; moaned Pat, discovering that her lungs filled with air as fast as she needed them to. Her back was tingling with pleasure, as she felt blood and energy being diverted to her new breathing apparatus. Her whole body felt alive, but her back felt like thousands of feathers were brushing against her, caressing her. It was making her even more excited. They were each pressing hard into each other, getting closer and closer to their orgasms. If only John were here to push them over the edge, Pat thought, as her own hair tickled against her gills, which brought even more tension to her pleasantly aching crotch. Acting on instinct, she lifted her other hand to Danni\u0026rsquo;s back and gently brushed her gills.\n\u0026ldquo;OH GOD,\u0026rdquo; Danni exploded in a spasm of pleasure, as her sensitive gills reacting to the gentle caress, intensifying her quivering clit trapped between their mashing hips.\n\u0026ldquo;OH MY GOD,\u0026rdquo; Pat joined her as Danni\u0026rsquo;s hand also rose to tickle her gills along her back.\nThey both arched into their orgasms, their hips joined in ecstasy, their legs entwined together, and their faces and their breasts arched towards the surface some twelve meters above them. They stayed like that for nearly a minute, quivering, convulsing, and coming as they floated in the dappled sunlight and warm ocean water.\nThis is how John found them.\nAs soon as John entered the water, he found that he could almost sense where they were, and without thinking, he started swimming in strong strokes, underwater, towards where he thought the girls were at the bottom of the lagoon. He sensed that they were several hundred meters out, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t even think about swimming on the surface as he normally did. He was in full \u0026ldquo;rescue mode\u0026rdquo; and made a beeline for their distant outlines.\nAbout two minutes later and nearly half the distance towards the girls, John noticed that he was swimming strong and comfortably, with no tightness in his chest. Further, that he could hear them groaning and moaning. He could see them, barely, as they were entwined together on the ocean floor, their hair swirling around as they seemed to grapple with each other in a wrestling match. As he sped up, ignoring for the moment his wonder at his own sustained physical effort under the water without any breathing, he discovered that could make out what they were saying, and realized that they weren\u0026rsquo;t fighting at all.\nQuite the opposite, in fact!\nHis urgency faded and was replaced by wonder and lust, not necessarily in that order. He was now within a few meters of the girls, and watched with appreciation as they held each other in their mutual orgasms. His own mast had now stiffened, which might also explain why he wasn\u0026rsquo;t swimming with the same speed as he had just a moment ago. He marveled at his own effortless breathing, and as he watched the last of the bubbles rise to the surface from their mutual expletives of pleasure, he experimentally released about half of his air into the water. He felt the slow filling of his lungs as his gills absorbed oxygen from the sea and metabolized it into air and refilled his lungs comfortably. He waited until the ladies had stopped quivering, and then he approached.\n\u0026ldquo;Any left for me?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\nLocked in their embrace, neither lady broke their pose, but both smiled towards the sunlight.\n\u0026ldquo;There might be,\u0026rdquo; Pat teased, as she gently ran her fingers across Danni\u0026rsquo;s gills again.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhhhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Danni screamed as she went into a second round of convulsions.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s amazing how easy it is to talk,\u0026rdquo; John offered.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s amazing how easy it is to cum,\u0026rdquo; Pat observed as she held the still shaking Danni in her arms, enjoying the pressure of their hips as they still ground against one another.\n\u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you find out by putting that mast to good use,\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, unhooking one leg from Danni to offer John access to her vagina.\nJohn swore he could almost see cum leaking from the two of them, a gentle cloud of color in the clear water. He clapped his hands above his head, sliding underneath the two floating ladies, and grabbed Pat\u0026rsquo;s hips to anchor himself. Danni adjusted her legs so that she now clutched one of Pat\u0026rsquo;s and one of John\u0026rsquo;s in her velvety thighs. That gave everyone leverage to line up all the important parts, and John aimed his pleasantly aching penis at Pat\u0026rsquo;s now gaping hole.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhhhh,\u0026rdquo; cried both Pat and John as the incredible sensation of a cool penis sliding into a hot cunt as a series of incredible sensations exploded through each of them. Danni also cried out, as she climaxed a third time as Pat moved her hips and her hands across the two most sensitive areas on Danni\u0026rsquo;s body. No one moved for a moment, the three of them locked in a passionate embrace, each of their lungs slowly filling with air after that shared outburst.\nThen John began to pump, slowly pushing his nine-inch cock in and out of Pat\u0026rsquo;s tight vagina. Danni could feel John\u0026rsquo;s cock as it slid past their connected crotches, into Pat\u0026rsquo;s tunnel. Pat luxuriated in the feeling of John\u0026rsquo;s thick cock as it slid icy cool, then steaming hot, in and out of her quivering hole. She could feel Danni\u0026rsquo;s excitement as their hips still ground against one another\u0026rsquo;s, John\u0026rsquo;s strong thighs entwined with their own; their breasts still mashed to one another\u0026rsquo;s. They continued lazily for a moment or so.\nThen Danni brought her hand up to Pat\u0026rsquo;s gills, and give her a light brush.\n\u0026ldquo;AAAAAAAHHHHHH,\u0026rdquo; screamed Pat as the most intense orgasm she had yet felt ripped through her body, her entire torso clenched in spasms of pleasure. She resumed her original pose, now even more intensely as her body visibly shook with pleasure, her thick nipples pointing to the sky.\n\u0026ldquo;AAAAAHHHHH,\u0026rdquo; screamed John, as his cock was compressed by the surge of Pat\u0026rsquo;s orgasm, ripping one of his own from his surprised body-suddenly feeling several strong, pulsing shots of cum shooting into her. His own body arched too, with his face contorted in pleasure, facing the bottom of the sea, as he held on to Pat\u0026rsquo;s hip\u0026rsquo;s with his hands, and Danni\u0026rsquo;s legs with his thighs, as his crotch pulsed again and again, filling Pat with his boiling cum.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah,\u0026rdquo; signed Danni as she watched her lovers catch up to the over powering orgasms she had already enjoyed, shaking in a nevertheless satisfyingly smaller orgasm.\nAn hour later, everyone was sated.\nThey had tried multiple positions, sometimes with just two, but most often all three of them entwined in nearly endless variations.\nThey now sat or floated with their legs interlocked, more or less, in the soft sand in the small bowl in which John had discovered the girls locked in their original embrace. They all found it odd, and at the same time completely natural, that they were sitting and chatting under water. There was an odd distortion to their diction, but after a moment or two, they found that they didn\u0026rsquo;t notice it very much. The biggest difference was that brief moment or two, a few seconds, really, that was required to re-fill their lungs with air. But after a while, even that pause seemed natural.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t have to leave the water, ever,\u0026rdquo; mused Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;But we probably should,\u0026rdquo; worried John.\n\u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;I think that our changes are being accelerated by our behaviors, and who knows what or how we might continue to change\u0026rdquo; (a pause) \u0026ldquo;into if we stayed in the water indefinitely,\u0026rdquo; explained John.\n\u0026ldquo;John\u0026rsquo;s right,\u0026rdquo; agreed Pat. \u0026ldquo;We need to be careful, though I\u0026rsquo;m not afraid of further changes,\u0026rdquo; (a pause) \u0026ldquo;since the ones we have undergone have been beneficial.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How so?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni?\n\u0026ldquo;Well, there\u0026rsquo;s this,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained as she ran her fingers along both John\u0026rsquo;s and Danni\u0026rsquo;s gills. They both shivered with pleasure.\n\u0026ldquo;Stop that, or we\u0026rsquo;ll never leave the water,\u0026rdquo; complained Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;This is also a great way to avoid unwanted visitors, strong storms, and various other disasters,\u0026rdquo; continued Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, even so, I think we should spend the night up on land, and\u0026rdquo; (a pause) \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m getting hungry,\u0026rdquo; warned John.\n\u0026ldquo;We can eat here, if we do sushi,\u0026rdquo; mused Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;I was getting fond of roasted fish,\u0026rdquo; pouted Danni. \u0026ldquo;And I like the smell of cooking. We can\u0026rsquo;t do that down here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, alright back to shore we go,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed, and turned to swim towards shore. Without even thinking, all three of them started swimming, frog style, towards the shore.\n\u0026ldquo;I guess we won\u0026rsquo;t ever have to swim along the surface, huh?\u0026rdquo; mused John as he pulled along side of Pat\u0026rsquo;s undulating body, enjoying the flex of her hips and legs as she kicked another scissors kick, propelling her forward.\n\u0026ldquo;Not unless we want to go fast,\u0026rdquo; rejoined Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;How about like this,\u0026rdquo; asked Danni as she switched her stoke from a frog to a dolphin kick, and stretched out her arms in front of her like Superwoman.\nPat and John watched in both wonder and lust, not necessarily in that order, as Danni\u0026rsquo;s shapely body undulated in the classic motions of a mermaid\u0026rsquo;s swim, except that not only was Danni much prettier than any movie version of a mermaid (and naked), but also her entire body seemed much more coordinated, or \u0026ldquo;in tune,\u0026rdquo; with her strokes, which shot her body forward with surprising speed. They both shrugged at each other and switched to dolphin kicks.\nIt took only a few tries, but both John and Pat realized that their bodies seemed particularly apt to this stroke. They both moved through the water with surprising speed and ease. Pat thrilled to the new rhythms she discovered in her body, the way her entire body sensuously, yet strongly, undulated through the water. It was as if she was swimming with her entire torso, rather than primarily with her limbs alone. It was intoxicating. The water rushed through her hair, caressed her breasts, and flicked off her toes as they beat the water up and down.\nDespite their best efforts, they didn\u0026rsquo;t catch Danni; though John nearly did.\n\u0026ldquo;Are we still human?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni.\nPat and John briefly shared a glance, as they each sipped some \u0026ldquo;punch\u0026rdquo; as they lounged in the hot tub. They had stayed away from the lagoon for several days, each thrilled yet spooked by the siren call the water had exerted upon their hearts, minds, and bodies. No one really wanted to talk about it, but each had both savored his or her time on land and feared the siren call of the sea.\nPat had spent time constructing a safe of sorts, carved from rocks embedded in the mountain itself, to store all her (some were \u0026ldquo;his,\u0026rdquo; she noted with irony) notes and formulas gathered over the past year or so. As she did so, she was consciously aware that one reason she felt compelled to do this task was that she felt as though she\u0026rsquo;d be spending more and more time in the water, and less and less time in the lab.\nJohn also had gathered equipment and supplies from the upper camps and distributed them to various locations around the island, mostly centered in the numerous caves and inlets that doted the ragged shore of the small island. He too had consciously felt the pull of the water.\nDanni, not having spent so much time on the island as Pat and John had simply taken to watching the sea from the high perch of the rocky outcropping upon which John and Pat had engineered their hot tub. She watched with both hope and fear as the other two had slowly but inexorably changed their focus from the mountainside to the ocean side. She wondered how long the pull of gravity on her breasts would remind her of her new sex, rather than the gentle caress of the water as it lifted and supported her swaying breasts. Both sensations felt powerful and wonderful, and she couldn\u0026rsquo;t decide which seemed to call to her more.\n\u0026ldquo;We will always be human, more or less,\u0026rdquo; Pat argued. \u0026ldquo;I know we are all feeling things, powerful feelings, but we are not losing any sort of human feelings towards one another.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right. I\u0026rsquo;m feeling more alive and in love than I have ever felt before,\u0026rdquo; Danni said unselfconsciously. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not afraid \u0026hellip; as long as I have you two,\u0026rdquo; Danni concluded as she slid across the tub to position herself in between her two lovers. \u0026ldquo;I never thought I could feel this way about anyone, but I\u0026rsquo;d do anything for you two.\u0026rdquo; Danni leaned into Pat and gave her a toe curling kiss, while John stroked the small of her back, admiring the dimples above her ass cheeks.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve only made love twice today \u0026hellip; we\u0026rsquo;re short of the required minimum,\u0026rdquo; Danni said coyly. \u0026ldquo;Who\u0026rsquo;s up for some loving?\u0026rdquo;\nJohn twisted his hips in reply, moving his already stiff member into the crack of her ass, causing Danni to hunch her hips back towards him. She turned more fully into Pat\u0026rsquo;s kisses, and let her breasts settle onto Pat\u0026rsquo;s. John guided her pussy over his rampant cock, and eased her down into his lap.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, god \u0026hellip; that feels so good,\u0026rdquo; breathed Danni as she found Pat\u0026rsquo;s equally wet and warm slit with her fingers and eased two into the breach, her thumb pressed lightly into Pat\u0026rsquo;s clit.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; breathed Pat, \u0026ldquo;it does \u0026hellip; sooooo good. Kiss me.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn began to stroke slowly in Danni\u0026rsquo;s hot pussy while Danni\u0026rsquo;s mouth and fingers worked magic on Pat\u0026rsquo;s eager body below her. Their legs again found themselves entwined, this time in the warmth of the hot tub. Danni was half floating in the water, half resting on Pat, which allowed John to admire the gentle quiver that ran up her ass and hips into the small of her back as he bottomed out on each stroke. Pat held Danni\u0026rsquo;s face in her hands, lavishing her with kisses and licks as John\u0026rsquo;s insistent strokes forced their breasts to slide past, around, and through one another\u0026rsquo;s in a symphony of sensation.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, god \u0026hellip; oh, god \u0026hellip; uh, uh, uh,\u0026rdquo; moaned Danni into Pat\u0026rsquo;s mouth, their full lips cushioning their kisses as John kept up a steady rhythm. She loved the intense fullness of John\u0026rsquo;s cock, the way her entire body was forced to respond to this powerful, yet gentle, invasion. She moaned anew as she felt John twist into a standing position behind her in the tub, never letting his rhythm falter, and felt his strong hands firmly grasp her waist just above her jutting hip bones. She felt her approaching orgasm building deliciously in her womb, sending out tendrils of electricity throughout her body.\nJohn slowly sped up his rhythm, keeping Danni\u0026rsquo;s beautiful ass just at the surface of the water so that the warm water of the hot tub reinforced the slapping of their bodies. Pat scooted up a bit, bringing her own generous breasts into the night air, and guided Danni\u0026rsquo;s lips to her nipples. Danni relaxed into the pillow of Pat\u0026rsquo;s breasts while John\u0026rsquo;s intensity slowly built.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, oh \u0026hellip; that\u0026rsquo;s it, right \u0026hellip; there,\u0026rdquo; Danni moaned as John\u0026rsquo;s hands gently tilted her hips out of the water while he rose slightly on his toes, so that his thick cock sawed firmly back and forth against her Gspot. Her narrow torso now began to twitch and quiver as her orgasm hurtled towards its climax. Her body was alight with an internal fire, every nerve ending seemed to be sending glorious signals to the center of her being, and she knew she was losing control of her body to the increasingly violent twitches and shakes of her impending orgasm.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s it baby,\u0026rdquo; cooed Pat in to Danni\u0026rsquo;s ear as she caressed and held the beautiful blonde\u0026rsquo;s face to her breast. \u0026ldquo;Cum for us.\u0026rdquo; With that, Pat ran a finger along Danni\u0026rsquo;s spine, not touching her gills, but her feather light touch nevertheless caused Danni to go over the edge. John held on for dear life as Danni thrashed out her passion in the hot tub, water and cum spraying everywhere.\nDanni rode out the orgasm, feeling her body clench and unclench with blinding speed, shaking her to her core. She was dimly aware of John\u0026rsquo;s own orgasm as she felt her internal muscles clamp down on his thick, hot cock, while he violently deposited his seed into her womb. So too with Pat\u0026rsquo;s nipple that she had bit down upon, which was now oozing a whitish substance into her nearly unconscious mouth.\nAll she knew was bliss.\nTwo days later, they found a boat on the other side of the island.\nPat had gone off on what she thought might be a final survey of the island, feeling the increasing tug of the water on her heart. She wanted to catalogue everything one more time. She also wanted to spend some time alone, away from the stimulation and affection of John and Danni. Oh, she enjoyed her time with them, but both she and Danni had been oozing a milk-like substance from their otherwise unaffected breasts for the past two days. After Danni had resumed conscious control of her body, she kissed Pat and shared the sweet warmth that had oozed from her own nipples. Later that same night when they returned to their mountainside hut, John was reprising the position with Pat on all fours, suspended above Danni, as Pat suckled Danni\u0026rsquo;s long nipples while John\u0026rsquo;s thick and tireless cock brought Pat to a shattering orgasm.\nDanni had also produced the same milky substance as had Pat. They had discovered that any suckling quickly produced milk from either girl, and that nearly any sexual activity produced leakage \u0026gt;from their breasts. And on the second evening, they discovered that repeated orgasms reached while they sucked on one another\u0026rsquo;s breasts would cause their breasts to swell until milk would literally shoot from their nipples as the girls shook with titanic orgasms.\nJohn thought it was the coolest thing ever, and Danni had reveled in this newfound facet of her still new femininity. Pat had enjoyed the feelings of \u0026ldquo;cuming\u0026rdquo; from both her crotch and her chest, but suspected that it signaled even more changes that were sweeping through their bodies. Her suspicions were confirmed when John discovered that a cut he barely noticed while gathering morning firewood was healed as he suckled Pat awake that morning. They were producing \u0026ldquo;goop,\u0026rdquo; more or less, from their breasts.\nThe long walk around the island in the early morning had produced the desired result in Pat. She was clear headed and calm, until she spotted the boat. It was a luxury pleasure fishing craft, new, and apparently undamaged, other than being stuck in the rocks a few meters off shore, tilting at a slight angle away from the surf. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any people, but she knew better than to explore alone. She hurried back to her side of the island.\nJohn and Danni were re-arranging supplies and food in the beach hut when Pat returned, flushed but not over exerted despite having run nearly two miles through the jungle.\n\u0026ldquo;We have visitors,\u0026rdquo; Pat announced.\n\u0026ldquo;Where?\u0026rdquo; John asked, putting down the fish he was cleaning.\n\u0026ldquo;Rocky Cove, due north,\u0026rdquo; she answered using the names they had given to the various parts of the island.\n\u0026ldquo;How many?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked, brushing sand from her hands and knees as she rose from the stack of palm fronds they had been drying for thatch.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t see any people, but the boat look undamaged, other than being wedged in some rocks. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t get very close.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a good thing. How far out is the boat?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;It is about ten meters from the shore in about five meters of water,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;The drop-off is fairly close to shore on the north side of the island, so we could swim around the island and get right up to the boat without being seen,\u0026rdquo; John offered.\n\u0026ldquo;We?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we,\u0026rdquo; answered Pat with a smile. \u0026ldquo;We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t separate ourselves, and we can warn each other if we see any sign of guns or ocean predators.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean, like sharks?\u0026rdquo; worried Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we\u0026rsquo;ve got to see how we do out in the open sea sooner or later,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;We can take some knives,\u0026rdquo; offered John as he strode to the hut and unearthed one of their hidden store boxes. He returned with two small knives and one large one that he strapped to his leg. The girls each strapped a smaller one to their shapely legs, and they all surveyed the beach and lagoon one more time.\nTheir quick scan of the camp showed that they had hidden or stowed most of their most valuable equipment, and that they could easily access various depots around their lagoon.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then \u0026hellip; let\u0026rsquo;s do it,\u0026rdquo; Danni agreed.\nAnd the three of them plunged into the warm water of \u0026ldquo;their\u0026rdquo; lagoon.\nThey each immediately resumed the dolphin strokes that had propelled them so efficiently when they were last in the water. John had to slow down as his body was stronger and had less hair, though his was getting long, and fewer protrusions, like breasts, that caused drag. Nevertheless, they all made good progress, improving their strokes as they went, so that by the time they reached the open water, their knees hardly bent at all, but rather their entire bodies were undulating through the water. They could easily talk, but they saved their energy for swimming at top speed. They were snaking through the water with an ease and grace that surprised each of them, and when they reached Rocky Cove about twenty minutes later, they knew that they were each swimming as fast as any Olympic swimmer, and entirely underwater. More surprisingly, they were apparently unaffected by this extraordinary effort.\nIt was about noon when they spotted the stern of the boat, with its large propellers visible in the surf as they hovered about five meters below the surface of the water. \u0026ldquo;The Argo: Byron Bay, Australia,\u0026rdquo; Pat made out through the rough surf above. The hull looked intact, though a good storm would pound the boat through the rocks and shatter it. John took the lead, and swam up to the ladder and then slowly and silently climbed up into the air.\nHe was unprepared for what he saw.\nThere was blood on the deck-a lot of blood on the deck.\n\u0026ldquo;Stay down there for a moment, but keep scanning the shore and sea,\u0026rdquo; he told the girls. Then he clambered over the bulkhead and onto the deck. The main cabin door was closed, but there was a bloody handprint on the door. He picked his way across the deck and towards the cabin. He peered in through the captain\u0026rsquo;s window, and could see several shapes slumped over the table, floor, and the lounge to the fore. This had been a luxury-fishing vessel. He saw no sign of weapons, and so he gently eased open the door.\nIt stopped against something heavy after only a few inches. He looked through the crack and saw an arm, a male arm, covered in blood. He pushed harder, and the arm moved. John pushed again, and the arm moved some more, but the inert man was very large. He glanced inside the cabin again, and saw that no one had moved. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure any of them were still alive, as there was a sickly smell coming from the now open cabin door.\n\u0026ldquo;Girls,\u0026rdquo; he called out. \u0026ldquo;Come on up and give me a hand.\u0026rdquo;\nThe three islanders stood unselfconsciously naked on the deck of the fishing boat, their long hair sluicing water down their backs, their bronze skin shining in the sunlight, their nearly perfect bodies moving with grace and power. Together, the three of them pushed the door open, and entered the cabin.\nThe stench was nearly overwhelming.\nThe large man was dead, but he was holding a gun. His face was bloated with dehydration. There was another man, much smaller than the large man at the door, who was tied to the table. He appeared to have been beaten, but it looked as though he was still breathing, if barely. Three other women were tied or handcuffed to chairs or the wall around the cabin. Two women looked to be in their mid-fifties, while the third looked to be a teenager who might have been attractive if she hadn\u0026rsquo;t also been beaten, and who knew what else. The all looked like they were still breathing.\nThe girls quickly set to work at freeing the captives with their knives while John stowed the gun behind a cushion and hauled the dead man out onto the deck and heaved his body into the surf off the stern. When he returned he found that the girls had been successful in their tasks.\n\u0026ldquo;They are all still alive, but just barely,\u0026rdquo; observed Pat as she cradled the teen\u0026rsquo;s head against her bosom.\n\u0026ldquo;We need to get them off this boat and back to the cove,\u0026rdquo; Danni said as she eased the man\u0026rsquo;s head to the floor, now that the ropes no longer bound him upright against the leg of the table. None of the captives seemed able to stir. \u0026ldquo;There doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be any food or water in this cabin.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There is an inflatable dinghy on the bow of the boat,\u0026rdquo; John observed. \u0026ldquo;It looks sound, and we can haul them back in that.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile John freed the boat, Pat gave a quick search confirmed that there was no water, no food, and no gas on the boat.\n\u0026ldquo;It looks as though they had a Mexican Standoff and drifted into our island,\u0026rdquo; Pat concluded. \u0026ldquo;We can find out more if they ever regain consciousness.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn tossed the dinghy over the stern and secured it to the bulkhead while the girls lifted each of the unconscious humans out onto the deck. One of the older ladies moaned briefly, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t regain consciousness. Pat went down to the boat as Danni and John lowered each person down to her. She arranged first the two women, who were the largest, on the bow and stern of the small craft, and then the badly beaten man and the teenager in the middle.\nDanni and John arched off the starboard side, gracefully slicing into the water and popped up beside the dinghy. Pat slid off the dinghy and joined them in the water. John took the bowline while each of the girls rested their hands on the stern. They all put their heads down into the water and started swimming.\nIt took them nearly an hour to get the boat back to the cove, and it was good timing. Clouds were beginning to appear on the eastern horizon, and Pat estimated that a storm of some size was heading their way. It would probably reach them by evening.\nThey simply dragged the inflatable up to the hut, which was only about thirty meters from the beach. Once there, they eased each of their patients into the hut and put a wet rag against each of their lips. After about an hour of slowly soaking their lips in water, the first of them stirred. It was the teenager.\nThe girl was a slightly built, blonde, with delicate elfin features that were swollen by dehydration and starvation. She was only about 5' 2'', and slender. She looked like she could be a relative of the middle-aged man, perhaps a daughter. He, on the other hand, was average height and weight, just shy of six feet tall, but he shared the same fine features around his eyes and nose. His hair was a light brown, rather than the teen\u0026rsquo;s blonde. The two older women were attractive, in good shape, but thin and gaunt. They looked like they had been starved for much longer than the girl or the man. They were each about five foot 10 or 11 inches tall, and they had matching haircuts-a pageboy that looked completely out of place in the tropics.\nThe teenager shifted again in her sleep, struggling towards consciousness.\n\u0026ldquo;Whuuu \u0026hellip;. Whuuuu,\u0026rdquo; she moaned.\n\u0026ldquo;Water, dear?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Whuuree ummm eee,\u0026rdquo; she croaked.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re safe,\u0026rdquo; Danni reassured her, even as she raised a cup of water to the girl\u0026rsquo;s cracked lips. \u0026ldquo;No too much, just a little to get started,\u0026rdquo; she chided as the young girl hungrily reached for cup.\nAfter about ten minutes, her eyes finally cracked open in the afternoon shade of the hut. \u0026ldquo;Where am I?\u0026rdquo; she asked more clearly, in an Australian accent.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re on an island in the South Pacific, one that had been used for nuclear testing about fifty years ago,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered gently stroking her hair out of the girl\u0026rsquo;s face. \u0026ldquo;We have been living here for a little less than a year, I guess.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who?\u0026rdquo; the young girl asked, as she slurped another drink of water.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m Pat,\u0026rdquo; she said, \u0026ldquo;and this is Danni,\u0026rdquo; indicating the woman who was cradling her head.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re pretty,\u0026rdquo; she whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you, my dear,\u0026rdquo; Danni smiled back at her. \u0026ldquo;So are you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, I\u0026rsquo;m not,\u0026rdquo; she whimpered as she screwed her eyes shut and buried her head in Danni\u0026rsquo;s lap. After a moment, she turned her head slightly, and lifted her eyes to Danni\u0026rsquo;s face, taking in the large protrusions that partially blocked her view. She turned back to Pat and took in, through her bleary eyes, Pat\u0026rsquo;s beautiful form.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re naked,\u0026rdquo; she whispered, surprised but not scandalized.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we\u0026rsquo;ve found it easier that way,\u0026rdquo; admitted Pat. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s your name, dear?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, Phoebe. I suspect that you\u0026rsquo;ve had a very tough time recently, and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to sort some things out,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;What about Uncle Pete,\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Uncle Pete,\u0026rdquo; asked Pat as she pointed at the man who was still unconscious against the far wall of the hut.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, poor Peter,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe whispered, a tear squeezing from her eye. \u0026ldquo;He tried so hard to stop them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Stop who?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Alberto \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Phoebe started.\n\u0026ldquo;Estanado,\u0026rdquo; finished Danni to Pat\u0026rsquo;s arched eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;You know him,\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;I had a run in with him myself,\u0026rdquo; Danni admitted. \u0026ldquo;Were you guys \u0026hellip; um \u0026hellip; doing anything \u0026hellip; illegal?\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe protested, coughing against her still dry throat. \u0026ldquo;Uncle Peter would never do any such thing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The other two women?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked indicating the still unconscious older women.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported. \u0026ldquo;They were on another boat when Alberto pirated ours.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The Argo?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, that is my Uncle\u0026rsquo;s boat,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe explained. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s a fairly rich investor, and he often invites me to spend weekends with him.\u0026rdquo; She took another sip of water. \u0026ldquo;Will he be alright?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I hope so,\u0026rdquo; Danni reassured her. \u0026ldquo;He is still breathing, but he\u0026rsquo;s taken a beating. We will have to be patient.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t there anything you can do for him?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe pleaded.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with a calculated eye towards Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;How\u0026rsquo;s it going in there?\u0026rdquo; asked John from outside the hut.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve got one awake, and three still recovering,\u0026rdquo; answered Pat. \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you introduce yourself?\u0026rdquo;\nJohn poked his head around the doorway and looked inside the slightly crowded hut. \u0026ldquo;Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m John.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you naked too?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, sorry about that,\u0026rdquo; John said sheepishly.\n\u0026ldquo;No worries,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said lightly. \u0026ldquo;I often go to the nude beach at home.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I\u0026rsquo;m nearly eighteen, and my parents don\u0026rsquo;t mind,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then,\u0026rdquo; said John stepping into the room, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m pleased to meet you.\u0026rdquo;\nPhoebe drew a sharp intake of breath. Never before had she seen such a magnificent work of manhood. John\u0026rsquo;s tall and lean, cut form took her breath away, and the six inches of relaxed man meat that swayed between his legs was equally engaging. Pat and Danni shared a knowing smile as they watched the young but injured girl attempt to sit up and straighten her blouse. John reached down and shook her hand and as she gave him a shy smile.\nAll this additional stimulation caused one of the women Pat had been tending to moan softly into her wet cloth. Pat hurried over and squeezed a few drops more into her mouth. The woman coughed softly, and wheezed.\n\u0026ldquo;Schtoop ieeet,\u0026rdquo; she moaned. \u0026ldquo;Doonnnn oooch meeee.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hush, hush,\u0026rdquo; Pat reassured her. \u0026ldquo;Alberto\u0026rsquo;s gone and you\u0026rsquo;re safe here.\u0026rdquo;\nAt the sound of the name that had tormented her for the past few months, Gail\u0026rsquo;s eyes shot open. She struggled to raise her head, but could only lift it an inch or so up, before her weakened condition forced her to give up.\n\u0026ldquo;Whhhhheeeeeeerrrrrreeee mmmm eeeeee?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re on an island, and you\u0026rsquo;re safe,\u0026rdquo; Pat stroked her hair away from her face.\nOver the next half hour, as the two women gained strength, the story slowly emerged from Phoebe and Gail. Gail and her sister, Michelle, had been missionaries in the Philippines when Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men had kidnapped them a few months ago. Michelle had fought against their captors at every opportunity, with the result that most of the abuse had been targeted on her, rather than Gail. Both women, however, had been raped and used by countless men for several weeks, when they were mysteriously transferred to The Argo about two weeks ago.\nAlberto\u0026rsquo;s men had pirated the ship that morning, and by noon two of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s henchmen had been assigned to take the boat and its three female passengers to Thailand where the women would be sold into prostitution, Peter was to have been killed at sea. However, the two men fought over who should \u0026ldquo;deflower\u0026rdquo; the young Phoebe. Peter, who spoke Spanish, had managed to sew distrust among them, keeping the two men in a state of agitation, so that neither trusted the other enough to spend time with Phoebe alone while the other one was to kill and dispose of Peter. Gail and Michelle had been locked in a smaller cabin.\nFinally, the henchmen had traded gunshots, and the larger man survived his wound. He had forced Peter and Michelle to cut up the body and dump it over board, by holding Phoebe and Gail at gunpoint, and then forced Michelle to tie up the others by threatening to shoot Phoebe, and then he handcuffed Michelle as well. Then the large man had repeatedly raped and beat Michelle in front of the others because she had refused to obey him. When Peter protested, he beat him as well.\nTwo days later, the henchmen, whose name they never learned, only that he was called Blade, began to act erratically, probably due to some infections from his wound. By that evening, Blade was delirious on the floor of the cabin, threatening to kill them all. Only Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s gentle promise of her virginity kept him from shooting everyone. Throughout the night, the helm was unmanned, and the boat wandering aimlessly at half throttle, with all the passengers trapped in the cabin.\nThankfully, Phoebe never had to make good on her promise, as the next morning Blade was dead, but the boat was still running, and no one could escape their bonds. Michelle had lost consciousness, and Peter joined her that evening. Gail and Phoebe tried to keep each other awake, and they made it through the second night. The next day, the engine finally ran out of gas, and after three more days of drifting, they had lost consciousness. They didn\u0026rsquo;t know how long it had been when John and the girls rescued them.\nPat concluded \u0026gt;from the story that Peter and Michelle were probably in serious trouble and might not regain consciousness.\nThe storm arrived as predicted, and the seven of them huddled safely in the hut through the night. The next morning, after checking on their patients, John jogged across the island to see if the boat had survived the storm while Danni and Pat prepared breakfast. When John returned, the three of them strolled down the beach, talking. The boat was gone with out a trace, both Phoebe and Gail were doing much better, but no improvement was visible in Peter or Michelle.\n\u0026ldquo;I think we need to tell them about the goop,\u0026rdquo; argued Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;We still don\u0026rsquo;t know them well enough,\u0026rdquo; Pat countered.\n\u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t know me at all, and now look at us,\u0026rdquo; Danni retorted.\n\u0026ldquo;Danni may have a point,\u0026rdquo; John offered.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean by that?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I think there may be some bonding that goes along with the transformations that we have experienced,\u0026rdquo; John explained. \u0026ldquo;When I am in the hut with Peter, I feel the twinges of that old worry, but not nearly the way I did with Daniel.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I forbid you to ever utter that name again,\u0026rdquo; Danni chided.\n\u0026ldquo;Noted,\u0026rdquo; mused John as he gave her a kiss that stiffened her nipples. \u0026ldquo;However, I think that like the fish, we might only need some sort of harem for multiple males to peacefully co-exist. Peter could start a new harem with Gail and Michelle, and we could adopt Pheobe.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re just eyeing that fresh young girl,\u0026rdquo; teased Pat. \u0026ldquo;You pervert, she\u0026rsquo;s still a virgin.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you\u0026rsquo;re not?\u0026rdquo; returned John.\n\u0026ldquo;No comment,\u0026rdquo; Pat grumped. \u0026ldquo;Besides, separating Peter and Phoebe would be a genetic plus.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are we talking about babies?\u0026rdquo; asked John with a slight stutter.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t have any birth control,\u0026rdquo; Pat said steadily. \u0026ldquo;Both Danni and I have had periods, and we have sex multiple times a day. I\u0026rsquo;d say it was merely a matter of time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god,\u0026rdquo; John muttered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m never having sex again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t bet on it,\u0026rdquo; teased Danni as she rubbed her breast against John\u0026rsquo;s elbow. \u0026ldquo;I can barely control myself for half a day.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think Danni\u0026rsquo;s right,\u0026rdquo; Pat concluded. \u0026ldquo;We have changed so much, and it seems to have Darwinian power behind it. If we don\u0026rsquo;t have babies, I think we\u0026rsquo;ll go mad. Besides, we no longer need to produce the goop. Danni and I are already doing it on our own, and I would bet that your sperm produces similar effects on anyone who ingests it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So what should we do?\u0026rdquo; ask the stunned John.\n\u0026ldquo;You and I should take Phoebe and Michelle, and Danni should go with Peter and Gail,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I see,\u0026rdquo; Danni said. \u0026ldquo;We each get an injured person, and one man whom we then can focus on to build the new family. And in a few days, when everyone is transformed, I can come back to you, and Michelle can return to Peter and Gail.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; said Pat. \u0026ldquo;We will always be our own family first.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, don\u0026rsquo;t I get any say in this?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; the two women said in unison as they turned back towards the hut.\n\u0026ldquo;Darwinian forces indeed,\u0026rdquo; John muttered under his breath. \u0026ldquo;The female of the species is always the more powerful.\u0026rdquo;\nBoth Phoebe and Gail were shaken by the news Danni and Pat had shared. But neither could ignore the steadily deteriorating conditions of both Peter and Michelle. They all sat in silence while the two women tried to absorb what their options were.\n\u0026ldquo;You were both men?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we were,\u0026rdquo; answered Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Would it work the other way?\u0026rdquo; Gail asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; answered Pat. \u0026ldquo;But I should think so.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How does it work?\u0026rdquo; asked Gail.\n\u0026ldquo;I think you should explain more fully why you want to know before I could explain to you how it might work,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Michelle was badly raped by many men,\u0026rdquo; Gail said tearfully. \u0026ldquo;And before she lost consciousness, she told me she wished she was a man.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s probably understandable, given what happened to her,\u0026rdquo; offered Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s more than that,\u0026rdquo; Gail continued. \u0026ldquo;Michelle was a lesbian, um \u0026hellip; who really resented being in a woman\u0026rsquo;s body. Being missionaries was one way of trying to avoid being a lesbian.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never much thought about sex,\u0026rdquo; Gail said, as though thinking about it for the first time. \u0026ldquo;I was always so wrapped up in my missionary work that I never gave it much thought. I think I\u0026rsquo;m asexual.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;None of us were overly sexually active,\u0026rdquo; warned Pat. \u0026ldquo;But since our transformations, sex is a very important part of our lives.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought as much,\u0026rdquo; sighed Gail. \u0026ldquo;But some things are more important.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Like what?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;I have to save Michelle\u0026rsquo;s life,\u0026rdquo; Gail said with a quaver. \u0026ldquo;I also know that I can\u0026rsquo;t go back to who I was. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe in many of the things and ideas I once did. Given all that has happened to me, I guess I\u0026rsquo;ve learned that life comes at us with more surprises than expectations. Everything I thought was true has been shown unreliable; a loving god, changing sex, even breathing underwater! I am not going to tell anyone ever again that I know better about life, God, or whatever, than someone else.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good plan,\u0026rdquo; said Pat gently. \u0026ldquo;I am not the person I once was. And Danni, you can wipe that smirk off your face. I meant it metaphysically, not just my gender.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I knew what you meant,\u0026rdquo; said Gail.\n\u0026ldquo;Peter too,\u0026rdquo; offered Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Peter too, what?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Peter was, or is, a cross-dresser, and I was one of the few people he trusted enough to tell,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe told her stunned listeners.\n\u0026ldquo;You mean we finally have some people who might actually want to change sexes, rather than accidentally?\u0026rdquo; observed Pat with some irony.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, really,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe urged, her youthful eyes now shinning with hope. \u0026ldquo;Peter would think that he had died and gone to heaven. He suffered so much, not just lately, but his whole life. He\u0026rsquo;s never married, but he\u0026rsquo;s so sweet. Please?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe pleaded.\nEveryone\u0026rsquo;s eyes turned to Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;So, we need either myself or Danni with each group, and that means we should put Peter and Gail with me and John, and Danni should go with Michelle and Phoebe. That way Michelle will have the largest mass in the group, and Phoebe can help reinforce Danni\u0026rsquo;s female status.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think we should feed Peter and Michelle the last of the distilled goop to speed their healing while you and Danni start Phoebe and Gail on their first feedings,\u0026rdquo; John offered. \u0026ldquo;That way, Michelle can walk up to the mountainside hut, along with Danni and Phoebe, while the rest of us stay at the beach. The close confines of the hot tub should both mentally promote and physically ease Michelle\u0026rsquo;s transition since she will be in close quarters with two other women.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe and Gail, I have to get your promise on something first,\u0026rdquo; Danni interjected.\nThey both nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;When all is said and done, Michelle can be the leader of one family, but I will return to John and Pat,\u0026rdquo; Danni continued solemnly. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve come to realize that the two of them are the true love of my life.\u0026rdquo;\nThere was an awkward silence.\n\u0026ldquo;Danni, you have my promise,\u0026rdquo; Gail said. \u0026ldquo;I will return to my sister, as I will be too old to worry about children.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go that far,\u0026rdquo; Pat mused. \u0026ldquo;All three of us got younger as we transitioned, so that now we appear to be the same age, more or less. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure the same will happen to you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Even to me?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t be sure, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think you\u0026rsquo;ll get younger,\u0026rdquo; Pat said thoughtfully. \u0026ldquo;But you will change. We all have changed.\u0026rdquo;\nThere was general agreement to John\u0026rsquo;s plan, despite all the warnings and worries, and so he ran to the mountainside hut to gather the last of the distilled goop, while Pat took Gail into her lap and guided her lips to her breasts. Danni moved Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s head back so she could reach the breasts that had dangled above her lips for most of the previous evening.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never done anything like this,\u0026rdquo; Gail offered hesitatingly. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that I can do it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Trust me,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;You will feel much better than you have ever felt in your life, and it will allow all of us to survive together on this island.\u0026rdquo;\nPhoebe, on the other hand, unhesitatingly took Danni\u0026rsquo;s extended nipple into her mouth and sucked earnestly. She was quickly rewarded with a warm sweetness that seemed to seep quickly through out her entire body, easing her aches and pains, and invigorating her tired mind and muscles. Danni was overwhelmed with pleasurable feelings as she felt Phoebe tug and pull at her breast, suckling on her expanding nipple. She could feel her other breast expand in anticipation of it\u0026rsquo;s use, and loved the feeling of fullness that stretched across her chest.\nPat noticed the change in Danni\u0026rsquo;s posture, her slightly open mouth, the glazed look in her eyes. She reached down to her own pendulous breast and pressed lightly under the nipple with her forefingers while using her thumb to apply pressure from above, then pulling her breast outward over Gail\u0026rsquo;s fearful face. After several invigorating pushes and pulls at her breast, she coaxed a few drops to appear on her large nipple. Pat noticed the changes in her own breathing, not quite sexual, but not NOT sexual either. Another sensuous tug and more drops appeared.\nThe frozen Gail watched in a mixture of horror and fascination as the drops gathered above her face, collecting at the bottom of the impressive bulge of Pat\u0026rsquo;s breasts as white milk oozed down from her nipple, where-after several more drops had collected- a large drop of milky white substance detached and landed on Gail\u0026rsquo;s parched lips.\nThe warmth and sweetness was a shock to her, but not nearly as shocking as the instantaneous and steady rise of her own hand reaching to pull the rest of that amazing breast to her lips. Pat saw that her first drops had had the intended effect, and lowered her swelling breast to Gail\u0026rsquo;s lips. She nearly arched back in pleasure at the first powerful contact as Gail sucked several inches of her breast into her mouth. Pat held steady, quivering with pleasure but she did not pull her breast from Gail\u0026rsquo;s now eager mouth as she felt the milk gush from her breast.\nWhen John returned, Phoebe and Gail had fallen into a deep, healing sleep; both of them having drained Pat and Danni dry. The girls took the remaining canisters of the goop from John and poured a few drops into Peter\u0026rsquo;s and Michelle\u0026rsquo;s lips. They then dabbed as much as they dared on the visible wounds and bruises they could find on each of their bodies, removing clothing as they went. Meanwhile, John gently removed Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s and Gail\u0026rsquo;s clothing as they slept. Both Peter and Michelle recovered enough consciousness to drink the remaining goop, but as soon as they were alert enough to ask a question, they lapsed into the same healing sleep that had claimed Phoebe, Gail, and Daniel.\nThe next morning everyone was alert, awake, and naked. As Phoebe gently walked the frail Peter towards the beach, she informed him of all she knew. Gail did the same in the opposite direction for Michelle. When everyone returned for the breakfast that Danni and Pat had now prepared, most everyone\u0026rsquo;s questions had been settled.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you really think this will make me a man?\u0026rdquo; asked Michelle.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we do,\u0026rdquo; answered Pat. \u0026ldquo;But it may do more than that, as we are not sure that our own changes are complete yet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean the mermaid thing?\u0026rdquo; asked Peter.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, though it is highly unlikely that we would simply morph into some sort of fantasy creature as depicted in the movies,\u0026rdquo; counted Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;You look like fantasies to me,\u0026rdquo; mused Phoebe as she admired Danni, Pat, and John.\n\u0026ldquo;It won\u0026rsquo;t be easy for you, Michelle,\u0026rdquo; offered Pat. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll have to will yourself to change, I think. Yours may take longer than Peter\u0026rsquo;s, and we know how long his will take.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We shall see,\u0026rdquo; Michelle offered with grim determination. \u0026ldquo;You weren\u0026rsquo;t on that boat.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then, Michael,\u0026rdquo; John said with compassion and surprised looks from all as they heard the masculine version of Michelle\u0026rsquo;s name, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll look forward to having a teammate when trouble next arrives.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You think they will be back?\u0026rdquo; asked Gail with fear in her voice.\n\u0026ldquo;That scum has already deposited two cargos on this island in the last few months,\u0026rdquo; Michelle said evenly. \u0026ldquo;We will run into Alberto and his men again. But the next time, things will be different \u0026hellip; really different.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd with that \u0026ldquo;Michael\u0026rdquo; collected the supplies that their group was to take up the mountain, and reached out to Danni and Phoebe. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go,\u0026rdquo; she said simply.\nGail started to say something, but a look from Michelle stopped her. \u0026ldquo;Goodbye, Michelle,\u0026rdquo; she said tearfully.\n\u0026ldquo;Goodbye Gail,\u0026rdquo; she said with determination. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll always be your sibling. Soon, I\u0026rsquo;ll be your brother.\u0026rdquo; And holding the other two girl\u0026rsquo;s hands, she strode confidently up the hill.\nPeter was nearly as shy as Gail had been at his first \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; feeding, but Pat was not in a patient mood.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve spent all morning telling me how lucky I am to be a woman, and you won\u0026rsquo;t take your lunch as you should,\u0026rdquo; Pat demanded. \u0026ldquo;Look at Gail, she\u0026rsquo;s raring to go.\u0026rdquo;\nGail was indeed eager to return to Pat\u0026rsquo;s breasts. Her brief feeding that morning was all that was necessary to convince her that the changes that were headed her way were good. She felt better physically and mentally than she had in years. It was as if the years were melting way. Her own hands looked more firm and less wrinkled than every before, and she could turn and swivel her hips more than she had since she was twenty. She could even touch her toes!\nPeter was puzzled by his reluctance. He intellectually knew what Pat\u0026rsquo;s breasts would do to him, or he at least believed what John and Pat had told him. He should be eager to embrace this opportunity.\n\u0026ldquo;Peter,\u0026rdquo; interrupted John. \u0026ldquo;What should your new name be?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My new name,\u0026rdquo; asked Peter.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, you\u0026rsquo;re about to be a woman \u0026hellip; so what should we call you?\u0026rdquo; repeated John.\nPeter looked at the stunningly handsome John. All his life he hoped for some man to call him Petra, and now one was asking him.\n\u0026ldquo;Petra,\u0026rdquo; offered Peter timidly. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to be called Petra.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;After the Playboy model from the early 90s?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat. \u0026ldquo;Hey, I was a guy once,\u0026rdquo; she said to John\u0026rsquo;s arched eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;No, actually, I dreamed of that name years before she arrived on the pages of Playboy, but for the last few years, I\u0026rsquo;ve fantasized about having her incredible body,\u0026rdquo; breathed Peter in a mixture of fear and anticipation.\n\u0026ldquo;Pat\u0026rsquo;s is better,\u0026rdquo; John said with a smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean, er,\u0026rdquo; Peter stammered. \u0026ldquo;But there is a resemblance between Pat and Petra.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She was taller, and her face was more angular,\u0026rdquo; Pat mused.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, but you\u0026rsquo;re still beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Peter argued.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not what either of us meant,\u0026rdquo; John assured him. \u0026ldquo;I was just teasing. I think that Pat ought to help Gail along, while Petra focuses on what I can do for her,\u0026rdquo; John concluded while stroking his cock to full attention.\n\u0026ldquo;John, I think you may have something there,\u0026rdquo; Pat mused as she saw the change in Peter\u0026rsquo;s/Petra\u0026rsquo;s face. \u0026ldquo;In fact, it would give us good data on the different effects of change agents; distilled goop versus organically produced compounds, and female fluids v. male fluids.\u0026rdquo;\nGail, seeing that Pat was now free from Petra\u0026rsquo;s attentions, rose from her bed to attach herself to Pat\u0026rsquo;s breasts. Both women gloried in the warmth and sensuousness that their coupling created.\nPeter was stunned with himself. No, Petra, yes, she/he thought to himself, I will become Petra. With that inner resolve, Peter crossed the hut to where John was standing, and sank to \u0026ldquo;her\u0026rdquo; knees and looked at John\u0026rsquo;s magnificent cock eye to eye. With a sudden resolve, she/he snared the cock in her lips and plunged it down her/his throat as far as it would go. Her nose was buried firmly in the musky thatch of hair that crowned John\u0026rsquo;s cock, and she inhaled deeply. Almost at that same moment, John\u0026rsquo;s strong eruption splashed down her throat.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah \u0026hellip; sorry \u0026hellip; oh \u0026hellip; my \u0026hellip; god \u0026hellip; there\u0026rsquo;s something pushing me \u0026hellip; ah, ah, Oooooh,\u0026rdquo; moaned John as an incredible orgasm ripped through his crotch. Six, seven, eight pulses, each as rich and strong as the first pulsed through his throbbing cock. Each pulse was met by an equally eager Petra as she eagerly welcomed the salty goodness down her throat. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t sorry at all.\nDanni had been unsure, at first, if it would work, but now, on the second morning, she had no doubts. Michelle/Michael had taken control of the two of them from the start, eagerly dominating both of them, but focusing her/his attention on Danni. She/he eagerly drank from Danni\u0026rsquo;s breasts, lapped up her cum from her multiple orgasms, and then eagerly drank from Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s quivering cunt as Phoebe suckled at Danni\u0026rsquo;s flowing breasts.\nMichael could feel his manhood developing with each sexual act. He remained ruthlessly focused on his physical journey, and it was easier and easier with each passing moment. He could feel his body shifting, his shoulders expanding, his hips narrowing, and his bulk increasing as he drank from Danni\u0026rsquo;s breasts and cunt. All three of them ate ravenously from the store of dried fruits and fish, along with fresh fruit when Danni stumbled into the jungle to find some, drained as she was by Michael\u0026rsquo;s intense efforts to change his sex. Michael seemed to benefit most from the fresh fruit, but more importantly, his growing size helped him focus on developing more power, more presence, and more stamina as both ladies pushed him to satisfy their own steadily increasing needs.\nPhoebe was surprised by the changes Danni\u0026rsquo;s milk caused. She was maturing quickly, her figure was filling out in all directions at once. She gained a few inches in height, her hair lengthened, her bust expanded, and her waist narrowed. Her hips became wide and womanly, no longer the slender, boyish hips of youth. Her nipples darkened and expanded, and her orgasms, as compared to the few she experienced previously, deepened and lengthened until she was truly a sexual creature equal to Danni. She was still a virgin, however.\nPhoebe loved nuzzling with Danni, but she was growing increasingly eager to actually have sex with Michael. She enjoyed the frantically forceful attempts by Michael to penetrate her with his slowly developing cock, and she knew that such prolonged attempts were important to prompting Michael\u0026rsquo;s transformation. She enjoyed the stimulation, but she wanted more. So far, it was still only a large clit, not the mature male penis she now craved. She watched with fascination as Michael slowly transformed from a middle-aged woman into a young, strong, and handsome male.\nLater that second day, Phoebe was latched onto his still tiny cockette, as Michael drank from Danni\u0026rsquo;s breasts, when he had his first intimations of a male orgasm. The nearly tasteless ejaculate was nevertheless sweet victory for all concerned. Phoebe wanted Michael to finish his transformation as much as Michael did. Despite her desire for Michael, she secretly still fantasized about John. Michael had gained some height, he was now about 6' 1\u0026rdquo;, but he was not going to be as tall and broad as John. He probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be as large \u0026ldquo;down there,\u0026rdquo; she suspected, either.\nThe three of them had talked about what would happen when Michael and Phoebe were finished transitioning the next morning, since Michael seemed to be following the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; three-day period of transformation. Danni warned them that she would return to the beach, as she was eager to return to Pat and John. She told them that they would have the next morning to discover what it was to lose their virginity to one another. She made them promise to be slow and gentle with one another, but from the looks in both their eyes, such advice was likely to be ignored. They burned with lust for one another.\nOn the third morning, Michael was complete and Phoebe was no longer a child. Their ages equalized to the early mid-twenties, and Michael reveled in the feelings of youth and power that now flowed through his transformed body. The previous Michelle flexed himself before the same mirror that Patrick had once appraised himself of the changes his body was undergoing. He was about 6' 1\u0026rdquo; tall, muscular but not heavily muscled, almost no body hair, with dark grey eyes, jet-black hair, and a strong jaw. His pageboy had grown out somewhat, and now looked more appropriate, more masculine, almost romantic, Michael thought. He could see the generous curves of Phoebe under the covers of the bed in the reflection of the mirror, and he gloried in the rising of his first true hard on. It felt great, so strong, so stiff, and so virile. He practiced making it jump up and down, enjoying the air as it rushed past his sensitive head.\nPhoebe watched with anticipation as Michael rose from the bed to check himself out in the mirror. Danni had stumbled down the mountain late last night, literally drained in her efforts to feed the both of them enough milk and cum to effect their transformations. As she lay there, pretending to be asleep, Phoebe thought that Michael was nearly the equal of John, but there was something she couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist about that first moment she had seen John. Despite that strong memory, nothing was going to stop her from making love to Michael. Phoebe snuck a glance at her newly matured body, and reveled in her womanly curves. Her breasts had expanded to a full C cup, and her nipples were thick and chewy like Pat\u0026rsquo;s. Her waist was narrow, and her hips were wide, while her pale skin and blonde hair in her crotch testified to her elfin features and Nordic coloring. Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s breath gathered ragged steam as she set her sights on Michael\u0026rsquo;s rising cock.\nMichael turned from the mirror and caught Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s eyes. He returned to the bed and lay down behind her, spooning her with his newly rampant cock pressing into the small of her back. Phoebe closed her eyes, taking in the sensations slowly: Michael\u0026rsquo;s breath was warm and moist on her neck, their legs were tangled together, his arm loose around her waist. Phoebe slowly slid her hand down to his and brought it up to lightly cup her heaving breast.\nShe snuggled deeper into him, breathing in his masculine scent, feeling his cock throb against her back. Michael savored the feminine sweetness of Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s neck and hair as she slowly moved her hips back against him. She felt herself getting wet. His hand began to lightly squeeze her breast, her nipple hardening against his palm. His tongue slid out along her neck, tasting, teeth nibbling. Phoebe felt a spreading of her juices along her thighs as he slide his torso lower, allowing his hardness to slip down between her now moist thighs.\nMichael marveled at how rough his own hand felt against Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s soft and smooth skin as he splayed across her stomach, holding her still, as he slowly slide into her. Her hotness was also a surprise, and he gasped with the newness of the sensation.\nPhoebe\u0026rsquo;s head pushed back against his neck, her face turning toward his to look into his eyes, as she felt every inch as he slowly entered her tight channel. They kissed as he gently but forcefully pushed past her maidenhead. Michael gasped again as he felt Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s muscles flex tight around his thickness as he buried himself deep inside her, even as their mutual moans vibrated inside his mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;That didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt as much as I thought it would,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe panted in between kisses.\n\u0026ldquo;I remember \u0026hellip; remember, \u0026quot; Michael asked, kissing her back.\nHe lifted his head to watch Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s face while he slowly pulled back out, gliding smoothly inside her. She nodded her understanding as she closed her eyes again so she could concentrate on the delicious feelings caused by his slow but steady pumping. His hand slid down her belly to her swollen lips, his fingers against her clit matching the slow, smooth rhythm of his cock sliding in and out of her. Yes, Michael understood the needs of a woman, but now he loved the feelings of confidence and control that coursed through him as he played Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s body like a master musician. After one long thrust into her, Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s hand shot back over his thigh, holding him tight against her quivering hips.\nThey lay still for several minutes, breathing deeply, until she calmed. Then they resumed the steady rhythm of his hips sliding his hardness slowly in and out of her tight, wet hole with long, slow thrusts. His lips moved against her shoulder and neck, kissing, biting, tasting her skin. Her hand rubbed against the back of his thigh, caressing his strong muscles with her fingers, clenching as the bulbous head of Michael\u0026rsquo;s cock brushed her G-spot. Their soft moans filled the morning air.\nHe licked down her neck, biting her gently along the way to her shoulder, moving his hips a little faster, a little harder, thrusting faster, harder inside her, as he felt her grip him tighter, getting wetter. His fingers against her clit matched the rhythm of their hips. Her grip on his thigh grew tighter, her hips pushing back against him, trying to force his thrusting deeper.\nPhoebe arched her neck, kissing Michael along his jaw, trying to consume this man who was making her feel such wonderful feelings. She reveled in his rough hands as he slid them down her soft and rounded thigh, lifting her leg back over his narrow hips. Her body rolled slightly, her left breast now up thrust, young, and firm, shaking with each stroke. Their breathing matched the quickening rhythm of their hips. Their lips crushed together again, tongues twisting, hot and wet. Phoebe hungrily sucked his tongue into her mouth, her teeth scraping against it. Then his lips slid against the front of her throat as he shifted his body above hers.\nPhoebe countered by turning fully on her back, both breasts firm and quivering, reaching up towards Michael\u0026rsquo;s swaying chest. His cock slowly pulled almost out of her as he raised her leg above him to lay it gently on his shoulder. He lifted her other leg to his other shoulder so that her knees were pressed into her breasts. Her hands reached up to cup his cheeks. Phoebe watched his face as he positioned himself above her, his body warm as he lowered it to hers. Whimpering with need, Phoebe pulled him down into a hungry kiss, his tongue sliding inside to taste her passion and urgency.\nMichael slid his hands under her arms to wrap around the tops of her shoulders, tightly holding her in place, feeling the beginnings of his first male orgasm, as he began to thrust harder, deeper inside her yielding flesh. He knew he needed to be in control, but it was so hard, so hot, so powerfully overwhelming. He could taste her smell, feel her whimpers, and taste her raw need. It was the most intoxicating moment he had ever felt.\nHer muscles squeezed around him, and she was getting wetter, her orgasm also building, her internal muscles clenching him tightly inside her. Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s hips rose up to meet his, thrust for thrust, her muscles flexing around his cock as the first wave hit her hard. Crying out, her body arched up into him, her hips bucking as Michael thrust hard and deep inside. Michael\u0026rsquo;s cock seemed to stretch and grow even further as her muscles clench tightly around him. But he remained in control.\nAs Phoebe came down, he gently kissed her, nibbling her lips. He had been patient. Now, it was his turn. Phoebe sensed his need as she ran her hands through his hair, holding his head, deepening the kiss, their tongues thrusting, their muffled moans filling each other\u0026rsquo;s mouth. Phoebe felt him inside her, stretching her, filling her, getting harder, thicker, as his orgasm built. Her whimpering became nearly constant. Michael\u0026rsquo;s hips slammed into hers with long, hard thrusts, pushing her deep into the mattress. Their eyes locked on each other, her nails biting into his upper arms, Phoebe cried out again. Her legs shaking against his shoulders as her second orgasm seized her to her core. Her muscles clamped tightly around his glorious cock, clenching, milking, pulsing, until Michael could hold back no longer. Phoebe felt him start to cum, shooting stream after stream inside her. Michael roared as he filled her, thrusting deep and hard, as he emptied himself into her.\nThey both lay, stunned, at the feelings they had experienced.\nPetra had taken some of Pat\u0026rsquo;s milk, and even tried licking her cum, but it was cock that she really wanted. After that first time, Petra held firm the vision of the woman he wanted to become, and after several more \u0026ldquo;feedings\u0026rdquo; from John during that first day; she knew she was well on her way.\nBy the second morning, Gail had regressed to her early thirties, more or less, and was filling out her gaunt and haggard frame. Her hair had turned a jet black, and her eyes were a light blue, almost aquamarine. The effect was stunning. She had never had an orgasm before her encounter with Pat, and now she couldn\u0026rsquo;t get enough. Although she had started by suckling at Pat\u0026rsquo;s magnificent breasts, she loved lapping at her sweet, hot, cunt. Pat assured her that any sexual fluid would probably work, and so they made it an experiment. Petra could drink from Pat\u0026rsquo;s breasts while Gail lapped at Pat\u0026rsquo;s cunt, and John would slowly fuck Gail from behind, completing the sexual circuit.\nJohn would save his orgasm, however, for the insatiable Petra. She had taken Pat\u0026rsquo;s advice on the speed with which changes would occur, and focused her oral attentions on John\u0026rsquo;s magnificent Johnson. Throughout the second day, Petra could feel herself not only getting younger and more flexible, but also reshaping her body into something approximating her ideal woman.\nIt was her later afternoon feeding, she called it, pulling John up onto the beach where she and Gail had been floating in the water, trying to sooth their aching bones that were shifting and growing or shrinking. Petra was shrinking in some areas, but growing in others. Her arms, ribs, and feet noticeably shrank, while her hips exploded outwards and her legs lengthened. Her hair grew at an astounding rate, and even her nipples had dramatically changed. As she sank to her knees before John\u0026rsquo;s ever ready cock, she was very much aware of how much she had changed.\nHers was now a classic hour-glass figure, and truth be told, she really did look like the Playboy original. She had only lost an inch or so, so she was probably the same height as the other Petra, and her shoulders were still broad when compared to Pat and Gail. But her back was dramatically feminine, and her ass that she settled over her feet was high and heart shaped. Her brown hair had thickened and now cascaded over her neck and upper shoulders. She slurped John into her mouth, and working with her customary efficiency, she brought him to the brink quickly. She squeezed the base of his cock, however, holding off the inevitable for just a bit while she smiled up at him.\n\u0026ldquo;How am I doing?\u0026rdquo; she teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Petra,\u0026rdquo; groaned John, \u0026ldquo;if you don\u0026rsquo;t finish me off, you\u0026rsquo;ll get tossed out to sea for bait.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why would you do that to me,\u0026rdquo; she cooed. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you like my little titties?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to bet that they won\u0026rsquo;t stay little long, but not if you don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026hellip; oh, god, please,\u0026rdquo; he sighed. \u0026ldquo;Not if you don\u0026rsquo;t actually swallow my cum, you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I know,\u0026rdquo; she giggled. \u0026ldquo;I just want to savor it.\u0026rdquo; And with that she plunged her mouth over his cock and released her grip. John almost fell to the ground in his release.\nBy the evening feeding, Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts had started in earnest, growing to a B cup, and Pat and John agreed that even though Peter hadn\u0026rsquo;t started out looking anything like Petra, she had nevertheless blossomed in the transformation. Pat predicted that by morning Petra, if they ever got off this island, would be the twin of the original.\nPetra lay among the tangled limbs of Gail, Pat, John, and herself, slowly stroking her growing breasts. After the \u0026ldquo;late evening feeding\u0026rdquo; they had grown even more, and were now past a C cup, with large chewy nipples, smaller than Pat\u0026rsquo;s but getting there. She looked to be in her twenties, and so did Gail, whose breasts were gently pressed into her arm as she slept next to her. Gail\u0026rsquo;s jet-black hair, aristocratic good looks, and lanky body thrilled her. She and Gail were exactly the same height, about 5' 10'' or 11'' the two tallest women on the island, unless Phoebe had grown significantly in her change. They would find out tomorrow, as everyone should be done changing.\nPetra stroked her nipple to tightness, marveling at the sensation of a tight bud of passion quivering several inches off her ribs. She and Gail had experimented for the first time in between the two evening feedings. Her cock had disappeared by noon, and her womb had appeared late in the afternoon, but her birth canal and final arrangement of her internal organs were not yet complete. Tomorrow morning, she thought eagerly, even as she savored the feelings of being the exact same height as the beautiful Gail, their breasts pressed into each other\u0026rsquo;s, while Petra expertly brought her to multiple orgasms. Sleep came slowly.\nGail knew she was done, and she was satisfied. Hell, she was thrilled. She appeared to be in her early twenties, had luxurious, jet black hair that curled down to her ass, large firm breasts, between a C and D cup, with nicely shaped nipples that puckered across the entire areolas, rather than just the nipple. Her nipple erections looked like small funnels perched on her round and full breasts, but the nipple itself only stuck out slightly from the surrounding erection. She liked it. It made her different from Danni, in addition to being a half a foot taller, who had returned in the middle of the night to burrow in between the sleeping Pat and John. She knew their bond was special, but it still made her feel excluded.\nAs she stretched in the morning sun, she reflected on the times had enjoyed her time with both Pat and Petra, and the occasional romp with John, but she really wanted to see Michael. She ached to see that the pain her sister had suffered was now eased by his hoped for transformation. The pure sexual energy that arose in her body as she imagined him also surprised her, but she welcomed the naughty implications. Yes, she was no longer the same woman she had been.\nShe decided, therefore, that Michael was going to be her first, sort of, now that she was complete, or as complete as possible. She lacked gills, but Pat assured her that in a few weeks, she would develop them as well. She walked along the beach in the early morning light, determined to let Petra discover herself with Pat, Danni, and John. She would wait for Michael.\nPetra awoke with a slight shiver. Unlike the previous two mornings, no other body was pressed against her. Danni had returned in the night, and Pat, Danni, and John were entwined in a sleeping tangle of which she had no part. Gail was gone from the hut, and she imagined that Michael, whatever he looked like now, and Phoebe were now enjoying the fruits of transformation. She wished her niece well.\nShe sat up and took stock of her situation. She was complete, she knew, and like her niece (or so she still supposed, it WAS early after all), she was a virgin. Her long hair reached down to the small of her back, and it was thick and strong while still being soft and silky. Her waist was narrow and slender, and her long, very long legs gracefully extended beyond her shapely waist. Her breasts were larger than Pat\u0026rsquo;s, and she gloried in their heavy weight, their tug at her collarbones and pectoral muscles. There was no ignoring Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts. They were enormous, double D or better.\nShe shook her shoulders just to feel them move, and then brought her hands up to the generous undersides of her breasts. She hefted each, feeling their weight, and sighed as her nipples tightened up with excitement. She was powerfully horny, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to wake anyone. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop stroking herself, pulling at her enormous breasts, feeling the sweet sensation of her nipples hardening in the morning air. She could feel her now complete pussy ooze her juices onto her thighs and butt.\nShe reclined back down with a soft sigh, one hand on a breast, the other buried in her crotch. The smell of her arousal was overwhelming.\nPat woke up first, and recognized the smell of Petra. She gave John a nudge with her hip as she slid over to the reclining Petra to suckle on her free breast. Petra gasped as Pat\u0026rsquo;s soft lips captured her other nipple, pulling her breast into the air with power and passion. Petra arched her back into Pat\u0026rsquo;s ministrations, pushing her generous breasts into the air. She soon felt John\u0026rsquo;s powerful presence between her legs, putting his hands over her fingers as she stroked herself, making sloshing sounds with her labia and clit.\nDanni gently lifted her hand from Petra\u0026rsquo;s other breast, and joined Pat in a vigorous sucking of her breasts. She was delirious with pleasure. She brought both her hands to the backs of each girl\u0026rsquo;s head, encouraging their morning ministrations on her soft, sensitive breasts. She barely noticed John repositioning himself between her legs, and she didn\u0026rsquo;t notice his gentle guidance of her knees as he spread them further apart. Nor did she realize that her labia had \u0026ldquo;popped\u0026rdquo; as she spread her legs, opening herself to John\u0026rsquo;s ready weapon. She was enjoying the feelings of her breasts being kneaded, suckled, pulled, and stroked by two experts in breast play.\nSuddenly, her world exploded. John\u0026rsquo;s thick, strong cock pushed inside the newly formed birth canal that Petra now possessed, eased by her steady flow of juices and aided by her own tilt of her pelvis to accept this large intruder. John met the resistance of her hymen, and pulled back slowly, rotating his hips, and letting his bulbous head twist in the entrance to her cunt. She was wild with need.\n\u0026ldquo;Damnit, will you put it in,\u0026rdquo; she demanded.\n\u0026ldquo;You have to ask nicely,\u0026rdquo; Pat advised, lifting her mouth from Petra\u0026rsquo;s stiff nipple.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my fucking god, will you please fuck me,\u0026rdquo; Petra wailed.\n\u0026ldquo;Anything my lady asks,\u0026rdquo; John answered as he powered past Petra\u0026rsquo;s brief virginity and sank to his hilt.\n\u0026ldquo;Ohhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Petra moaned in pain and satisfaction. \u0026ldquo;Again.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn withdrew, and slammed it home a second time.\n\u0026ldquo;Again,\u0026rdquo; whispered Petra with less force and more need.\nJohn complied, again , and again, and again \u0026hellip; until Petra lifted her legs around John\u0026rsquo;s hips, and clenched his back as she shuddered through her first female orgasm. The feeling of the sweaty bodies writhing and rubbing through her climax was incredible. She didn\u0026rsquo;t think she could maintain consciousness, but she hung on.\nWhen she was done shaking, Danni, Pat, and John collapsed onto themselves, and Petra couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell who was doing what to whom. She decided to leave them to their reunion, and shakily got to her feet. She found Gail outside the hut enjoying the morning sun and sat down beside her.\n\u0026ldquo;They are having fun,\u0026rdquo; she observed with irony as the moans and giggles floated past them as they sat naked and beautiful in the morning sun.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Gail offered without turning her head from the east where she watched the sun rise over the left arm of the lagoon. \u0026ldquo;We will have our own family when Michael returns.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat surprised Petra was the fact that she actually felt a twitch in her cunt when Gail said that. She looked at Gail\u0026rsquo;s dark, severe beauty, with her jet-black hair, her tall and strong figure, and her sinewy muscles. Yes, Gail was beautiful and compelling, and they were nearly the same height and size, Petra\u0026rsquo;s stunning breasts were larger than Gail\u0026rsquo;s, but Petra had no idea what Michael might look like, or how he would act. John was attractive, but there didn\u0026rsquo;t be the same zing as Danni and Pat seemed to have for him \u0026hellip; or Phoebe, if she was honest with herself.\n\u0026ldquo;When Michael comes down, I want you with me,\u0026rdquo; Gail said, still without turning. \u0026ldquo;It will be my first time, and I want you there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why,\u0026rdquo; Petra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Because you tried to save us,\u0026rdquo; Gail answered, turning to Petra. She reached out and pulled Petra into a kiss, and when they broke, with eyes shinning, she continued, \u0026ldquo;and because you are beautiful to me \u0026hellip; inside and out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re beautiful to me too,\u0026rdquo; Petra said. \u0026ldquo;I just tried to be as strong as you and Michelle.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Michael,\u0026rdquo; Gail answered with anticipation. \u0026ldquo;Besides, I want to make love to Michael in the water, not a prostitute\u0026rsquo;s bed, and I\u0026rsquo;ll need someone to hold my head above water.\u0026rdquo;\nIt was shortly after breakfast when Michael and Phoebe arrived. Pat, Danni, and John returned to the hut as Gail and Petra cleaned up, but they came back out when they heard Gail\u0026rsquo;s and Petra\u0026rsquo;s squeals of joy as Michael and Phoebe emerged from the jungle onto the beach. The two tall dark haired ravens had tackled the equally tall and dark Michael at the edge of the beach and dragged him down to the water. Soon the three of them were locked in a passionate embrace that clearly spoke of a new bonding emerging.\nPhoebe looked a bit lost as she watched the young man who had so recently taken her virginity cavort in the water with the two women who towered over her.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, what\u0026rsquo;s up?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni as she slipped an arm around Phoebe while admiring the work the changes had done upon her.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought it would be more \u0026hellip; something different,\u0026rdquo; she whispered, still watching Gail, Petra, and Michael.\n\u0026ldquo;Those two Amazons want a man who is the same size as they are,\u0026rdquo; Pat giggled as she took Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s other side. \u0026ldquo;I saw the way that you looked at John the first time you looked at him.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, and I saw the way that you looked at her,\u0026rdquo; teased Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Your point?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Can I help it if I like my men tall and my women my height,\u0026rdquo; she protested even as she raised herself on tippy toes to be the same height as Phoebe and Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Did you guys really do that,\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe incredulously.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, we did,\u0026rdquo; answered Danni as she pulled Phoebe into a kiss that reached her bronchial passages.\nTwo months later, they were all floating in the sand bowl out in the middle of the lagoon, waiting out a terrible storm that lashed the surface above them. Their family units, or pods as they jokingly called themselves, had solidified into two groups: John with Pat, Danni, and Phoebe, and Michael with Gail and Petra. Everyone had developed gills, and they were all accomplished swimmers and hunter/gatherers. They spent most of their time in the ocean, venturing around the island from time to time, hoping to spot Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men before they themselves were spotted.\nThey mixed their time between land and sea, and no further changes had yet been experienced, though Phoebe had noticed that John\u0026rsquo;s, Pat\u0026rsquo;s, and Danni\u0026rsquo;s hands and feet had started to show signs of webbing. None of the others noticed, however, and so she kept it to herself.\nThe women of each pod found themselves on slightly different but unified cycles, Phoebe having merged with Pat and Danni\u0026rsquo;s regular cycle, and Gail and Petra following in near perfect symmetry about two weeks later. Michael and John were able to function quite easily as long as they each had one of their \u0026ldquo;own\u0026rdquo; women with them, but they grew tense and aggressive when it was the two of them and a single woman. The girls figured out how their sexual systems worked, and simply arranged for someone to be with their man whenever a group meeting was needed or desired. For the most part, each pod kept to itself.\n\u0026ldquo;This is the biggest storm we\u0026rsquo;ve seen since we got here,\u0026rdquo; Pat observed.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, and who knows what it might wash ashore,\u0026rdquo; John said ominously.\n04 - A Mermaid\u0026rsquo;s Tail Sometimes, Pat hated being right. The scientist in her always wanted to be right, but the woman she had become, feared the conclusions she was reaching.\nShe stood on the ruined wreck of a sailing craft that had grounded ashore on their island\u0026rsquo;s southeast shore, just on the other side of the lagoon in which the two pods had initially made their homes. John and Michael were lifting debris and remains off of the deck, which was riddled with bullet holes, while she and Gail searched for clues and salvageable items from the cabins. The craft had been abandoned for some time-they couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell how long-and not much was useful. Most of the advanced electronic equipment had been smashed or shot through, and no one in the pods wore clothes any longer, so the clothes and other personal items were not useful either.\nActually, now that she remembered, she was right about Michael being right, which made it worse: some one else was right, too. When Michael was Michelle, he (she) had warned of a return of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men. It was fortunate that they had been preparing for this moment for the last several months.\nPat stopped reading the diary she had found in one of the cabin drawers, where this family had stowed some of their clothes, to brush a tear from her eye. She was crying for two reasons; first, she found herself feeling more and more emotional in recent months, feeling an ache for a \u0026ldquo;family\u0026rdquo; in ways the former man found new and troubling. Second, she and Michael had been right: the carnage they were sifting through was caused by Alberto Estanado, the drug lord from whom first Danni-and more recently Michael, Gail, Petra, and Phoebe-had managed to escape, through a great deal of luck, by coming to this island.\n\u0026ldquo;Gail, look,\u0026rdquo; she said, holding out the small book she had found under a jumble of boy\u0026rsquo;s underwear and girl\u0026rsquo;s bras and panties.\nGail walked over to her, picking her way among the broken furniture, smashed equipment, and torn clothes. Pat had come to appreciate Gail\u0026rsquo;s quite strength and firm leadership. The former middle-aged missionary was now a far cry from the repressed, dumpy, and frigid lady she had been originally. Gail was tall, nearly a half a foot taller than Pat, and strong. Her bronzed skin rippled with muscles, reminding her of Lucy Lawless. Gail never bossed anyone around, but her physical and mental focus was nearly as overpowering as John\u0026rsquo;s sheer physical size. Gail took the book from Pat, and skimmed through it quickly. It looked like a girl\u0026rsquo;s diary, full of doodles, pictures from magazines, poems, sketches, pictures of the doomed family, dreams, and dares. The last few pages, however, were a quickly scrawled litany of horror.\nFrom this new evidence, they now knew that the sailing craft had belonged to a family of five: parents with triplets, two daughters and a son, all teenagers. When they first started searching through the wreckage nearly an hour ago, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell who or how many people had been on the boat. The birds had feasted on the remains while the boat drifted towards the shore. No pictures remained in the cabin, and there were at least three human remains on the deck, but they were so badly eaten away or decomposed, their sexes, ages, and even their sizes were practicably indistinguishable. The diary confirmed these facts and more.\nAlberto\u0026rsquo;s men had pirated the boat, killed their father, and raped their mother. The two teenaged girls were to be sold for prostitution, while the boy was to be saved for \u0026ldquo;something special.\u0026rdquo; The diary ended there. No word on what happened to the boy, whose named appeared to be Martin. Gail guessed that one of the two girls was the author, either Ricki, or her twin sister, Cleo. They were probably on their way to Thailand or Singapore to be sold into prostitution, maybe even their unnamed mother as well. Pat\u0026rsquo;s gut twisted, and her eyes misted again.\nPat\u0026rsquo;s feelings towards Danni, Phoebe, and John were as lovers, but she knew that some day, children were inevitable, especially considering how much sex everyone was having. Still, it had been several months since the arrival of The Argo and the addition of Michael, Gail, Petra, and Phoebe to their island, and no one had yet skipped a period. Pat suspected it was because their bodies had not yet finished transitioning into their final forms. She had noticed that John, Danni, and herself had developed delicate webbing in between their fingers and toes, but she wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure it how much further beyond that it would go. In any event, she didn\u0026rsquo;t want her paradise to be continually under threat from this madman.\nGail\u0026rsquo;s normally severe beauty tightened even further as she read the diary. Alberto had tormented her and her \u0026ldquo;then\u0026rdquo; sister, Michelle, for months before they, and Phoebe and her \u0026ldquo;then\u0026rdquo; Uncle Peter had managed to escape, accidentally, to this island. Now Michael, Petra, and herself formed the other family pod to John and his girls. Michael had proven himself a talented and capable lover for both she and Petra, though Gail could tell that Michael felt something special for Petra, who returned his fervor with extra emphasis. Gail loved Michael, but her body and emotions responded to Petra, though she knew that Petra was head over heels in love with Michael.\nAs a result, Gail found a sense of purpose as she became the level headed master of tactics, resources, and action for both groups. Pat was the scientist-mom of the group; John was the bodyguard, the tallest, and strongest of all. Danni was the playful cheerleader, while Phoebe was the studious youth, following in Pat\u0026rsquo;s footsteps. Petra was the sensuous mother-goddess, while Michael was Gail\u0026rsquo;s warrior, able to understand her with a flick of an eye, and together they were ruthless. Both pods had enjoyed many a shark steak seared over a beach fire as the result of their efforts.\nFor the last several months, both pods divided their time between the ocean and the land, with their days mostly in the water, and their nights mostly on the land. Pat had hypothesized that prolonged exposure to the water would change their bodies so much that moving around on the land might be difficult, and every one had agreed such a change was likely. Phoebe was the only one who actually talked about wanting to become a mermaid, and despite the many talks Pat had with her about the likelihood of the changes they were undergoing to result in the aesthetically pleasing, mythical \u0026ldquo;mermaid\u0026rdquo; of yore, she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t give up on her dream.\nUnder Gail\u0026rsquo;s strong leadership, they had more thoroughly explored their island for geographic features useful for hiding, hunting, and protecting themselves. Pat and John had mapped the island for botanical and animal life when they first arrived over a year ago, but the two men (then) hadn\u0026rsquo;t been concerned about defending themselves or the island from drug/prostitution pirates. Now, they had found an extensive system of interconnected caves on the western edge of the island, where the volcano above dropped into the sea in a sheer cliff. The southern island had a large land shelf with several lagoons, of which theirs was the largest, and a system of coral reefs off shore that curved around to the east of the island. The eastern and northern slopes were not the sheer cliffs of the western island, but eased gently towards the sea in a series of rocky coves spotted with small, white beaches, and rocky outcroppings. There were caves here too, but not so numerous or as interconnected as those to the west.\nThey had spent the last two weeks moving most of the equipment from the mountainside and beach huts to the caves in the west, which could only be accessed via underwater passageways, old magma tunnels that had cooled and which now stretched deep into the mountain with hundreds of twists and turns. There was one cave, deep in the system, that had a large chimney with a nearly invisible opening not too far from the hot tub John and Pat had built on promontory mid-way up the southwestern side of volcano. John\u0026rsquo;s pod had carefully lowered the equipment and records that might get damaged by the sea down this chimney to Michael\u0026rsquo;s pod, who then redistributed it among the dry shelves and rooms that opened along various twists and turns of the tunnels of water that they had now mapped, and in which they built their new homes.\nPetra had been floating in a pool that was in a room next to the \u0026ldquo;chimney room\u0026rdquo; after helping Gail and Michael lug another load from that room to several of the various caves they had designated for each function (the lab, the library, Michael\u0026rsquo;s pod\u0026rsquo;s bedroom, John\u0026rsquo;s pod\u0026rsquo;s bedroom, etc.,), when she discovered that the seemingly solid volcanic rock that formed the vaulted arch of this small space was actually riddled with holes that apparently snaked throughout the island.\nIf she was still, she could hear Pat and John talking as they passed the hot tub, Danni muttering to her self at the mountainside camp several hundred yards around the mountain, and even Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s antics in the caves and coves at the eastern side of the island (where she was supposed to be collecting information on the size and shape of all the major inlets on that side, but was playing with dolphins instead). She called out to Michael and Gail, and they listened as well. Gail then formulated a plan that she shared with Pat and John when they brought the next load to the chimney to map out where all the \u0026ldquo;listening tubes,\u0026rdquo; as Petra called them, went. They had finished mapping about twenty or so clear listening tubes that covered most of the island, when the boat had washed ashore that morning.\nAs Pat watched Gail process the diary and its contents, her mind drifted to her own family pod. John was her oldest and best friend, and more recently, her lover. Danni an unexpected bonus, but her sunny disposition and frank eagerness for sex had made her an essential balance to her own bookishness and John\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;strong and silent\u0026rdquo; type. Their newest \u0026ldquo;sister/wife\u0026rdquo; was Phoebe, who had been a water nymph growing up near the Gold Coast of Australia. She had probably spent more time in or on the water than she had on the land in her childhood. She was a natural in the water, swimming nearly as fast and as effortlessly as Michael or John, who were each twice as strong as she was. Despite her dreams of becoming a mermaid, she accepted the leadership of Gail and Pat, and spent each night, like the rest of them, on land-at first on the huts on the beach, and more recently in the caves to which they had moved. Pat loved each one of them immensely.\nShe knew what the diary meant: some day those men would show up here. She was a scientist, not a general. She felt helpless and angry.\nGail put the diary down, and gave another cursory look around the cabin. \u0026ldquo;We won\u0026rsquo;t likely find anything more that is useful, though I promised Petra I would bring back any clothes that looked like they might fit her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Clothes?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;She used to be a cross-dresser,\u0026rdquo; Gail added. \u0026ldquo;Remember?\u0026rdquo;\nPat nodded. Pat was herself an accidental, though very happy new woman, whereas Petra had dreamed of becoming one for years. Now that she finally had the body to die for, she was on a tropical island spending all of her time naked-not especially satisfying for a former cross-dresser. Pat helped Gail go through the drawers, and found a few things that might fit the voluptuous Petra. Apparently, the mother of this tragic family was of a similar build to Petra, whereas the girls were still teenagers, though bikini\u0026rsquo;s that belonged to the girls were still a full C cup. Petra, however, was a DD with some extra change thrown in for good measure. Together, they filled a small suitcase with bikinis and lingerie, and went out onto the deck.\nMichael and John had finished cleaning and sorting the debris on the deck. Like the cabin, nothing was useful, most of it deliberately destroyed. They had discovered that the two of them worked well as a team when they were alone together or when they each had a sister-wife with them. It was only when it was three of them, the two men and one woman, when the nearly uncontrollable urges towards violence and aggression arose.\n\u0026ldquo;We found a diary,\u0026rdquo; Gail reported.\n\u0026ldquo;And?\u0026rdquo; John asked in his usual loquacious manner.\n\u0026ldquo;Alberto,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered.\n\u0026ldquo;This is not good news,\u0026rdquo; Michael said as he scanned the horizon as though Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men would suddenly appear.\n\u0026ldquo;We should get back to the lagoon and make some plans,\u0026rdquo; Gail suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;What about the boat?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat. \u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we try to get rid of it or something?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s too big to move,\u0026rdquo; Gail said, looking things over. \u0026ldquo;And a fire would signal to anyone watching that there was human activity on this island. We should just leave it here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The next storm may take care of it,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;If we\u0026rsquo;re lucky.\u0026rdquo;\nThe four of them climbed down the side of the boat and headed back towards the lagoon. They had a lot of planning to do.\nIt was Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s turn to \u0026ldquo;man\u0026rdquo; the hot tub lookout that day. She could see the small specks of John, Pat, Michael, and Gail as they trotted back across the eastern arm of sand and palm trees that formed the northeastern boundary of their large lagoon. Beyond them, the sea was calm, and empty.\nShe thought back to the first time John, Pat, and Danni had taken her to this hot tub a few weeks ago. It had been a beautiful evening, a clear night with the Milky Way glowing visibly across the southern sky. All three of them had lavished her with attention for the better part of two hours, and when they were through with her, she lay limply in the warm water for another hour watching the three of them frolic and play before she could rejoin them. John seemed to have endless stamina, which suited the three girls just fine. Phoebe sighed as her nipples stiffened at the memory.\nShe looked down at her vastly changed body. When she arrived she was starving, skinny, and a teenager. Now, she was womanly, well fed, and well loved. She lifted a delicate finger to her stiff nipple, and gave it a small squeeze, prompting a small offering of her milk. God, that felt so wonderful, she thought to herself. All the girls were now producing milk on demand, which had saved Phoebe a nasty cut on her calf from the coral. Danni had simply squeezed a drop or two from her breasts onto Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s leg, and the deep scrape healed within an hour without a trace. She licked her breast and tasted her own milk. It was sweet and warm. Her could feel her gills along her back reaching into the hot tub, which only added to her feelings of sensuousness and femininity. She had grown up in Australia where popular culture had idolized mermaids, and many women \u0026ldquo;practiced\u0026rdquo; being mermaids with latex or fabric tails in the warm tropical waters of the Gold Coast where she had lived. They weren\u0026rsquo;t real mermaids, of course, but there were no such things as mermaids, right?\nNot for Phoebe. She was a mermaid in her imagination, a beautiful creature of mystery, myth, and the sea. Her other hand slowly snaked down her torso towards her crotch. She loved the way her body could stimulate Pat, Danni, and John-and herself, on occasions like this one. She continued to milk one breast, pulling it up to her eager mouth as milk oozed forth, while running her other hand over her stomach and flanks. Her body was so similar to Danni\u0026rsquo;s and Pat\u0026rsquo;s, but she was the only one who had been born a girl. She giggled at the memory of her transformation from a skinny teen to a voluptuous woman with Danni\u0026rsquo;s help. She imagined she was again drinking \u0026gt;from those amazing breasts, with those long nipples. She collected the milk she herself had produced on her finger, and sucked on it as though it was Danni\u0026rsquo;s nipple. She knew she was the only one who wanted to continue the transformation, and she didn\u0026rsquo;t know why the thought excited her so much.\nShe ran her hands along her waist, imagining that a beautiful mermaid\u0026rsquo;s tail actually started there, decorated by flecks of color and light as her own skin transitioned from soft, feminine flesh to shiny, undulating scales. Her hand stroked downward to \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; her tail, but was interrupted by the light tuft of hair at the top of her vagina. It was a worthy reminder of what she did have, and she began flicking gently at her clit. Her other hand continued to tug on her turgid nipples, seeking to make her breasts ooze more of the white milk that seemed to be the key to all these changes. As her arousal grew, her breasts swelled with her passion, and the water in the hot tub began to slosh and splash as her body responded to her self love. She pointed her legs across the water, as she imagined that the flesh colored webbing she could see starting to form between John\u0026rsquo;s, Pat\u0026rsquo;s, and Danni\u0026rsquo;s fingers had spread to her own, but instead was an iridescent blue, and she imagined that her legs were a long, graceful tail with power, grace, and beauty shimmering like a rainbow in the hot tub. Her fingers blurred at her crotch, while her breast spurted three streams of milk, one of which landing on her face and neck. She pulled again at her breast, and succeeded at getting a stream to hit her mouth cleanly. The sweetness was delicious, and she imagined her own milk coursing through her body, changing her. She cried out as the image and her orgasm collided, and tremors of pleasure coursed through her body.\nWhen she recovered sufficiently so that she could open her eyes, Phoebe saw the spots along the horizon that signified they would be having visitors within a few hours.\nNormally, they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have walked back, but Gail wanted to keep the clothes dry for Petra. So, John, Michael, and Pat all walked back with her. Petra, nee Peter the former cross-dresser, had transformed into a nearly exact replica of the Playboy playmate from the early 90s, Petra Verkaik, though this Petra was a bit taller than the original. Petra shared the same lanky build, however, the same unexpectedly large and lush breasts, and the same dramatic, arched beauty in her face and eyes. She and Gail were the exact same height, but Gail was a true Amazon, all angles and power, whereas Petra was curves and softness.\nThey made a good pair, Michael thought to himself as he watched Petra run up the beach to embrace her sister-wife. He didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to convince Gail that he loved them both deeply, but he knew that he would continue to try. Making love to Petra was like wallowing in softness and squeals, whereas Gail was a tigress, fierce and quiet, matching him stroke for stroke, taking her orgasms with control, seeking to cum with purpose. Petra, on the other hand, gave herself completely over to the overwhelming power of sex, often losing consciousness from the rolling waves of her multiple orgasms.\nDanni waved from the beach hut, as the five of them walked up the beach. They arrived at the hut just as Phoebe breathlessly emerged from the jungle trail leading up to the mountainside huts.\n\u0026ldquo;Boats,\u0026rdquo; she said urgently. \u0026ldquo;At least two.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Where?\u0026rdquo; snapped Gail?\n\u0026ldquo;South-south east,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported. \u0026ldquo;On the horizon, they looked to be standard fishing-pleasure yachts.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They won\u0026rsquo;t get here, if they are headed here, until nightfall,\u0026rdquo; Pat concluded.\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Gail said with determination. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s put this plan into action.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now?\u0026rdquo; asked John. \u0026ldquo;Do you think they are headed here?\u0026rdquo;\nPat and Gail held each other\u0026rsquo;s eyes for a long moment, and then they turned to the other girls and held their gaze in silence.\n\u0026ldquo;Women\u0026rsquo;s intuition,\u0026rdquo; Michael whispered conspiratorially to John. \u0026ldquo;I used to know a thing or two about that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You sure?\u0026rdquo; asked John, chucking him on the shoulder. \u0026ldquo;Lately, you\u0026rsquo;re as bad as I am.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Michael said with a feral grin. \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t that great?\u0026rdquo;\nThe girls sighed collectively.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s them,\u0026rdquo; Gail reported.\n\u0026ldquo;We can all sense it,\u0026rdquo; Pat finished.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you\u0026rsquo;re the bosses,\u0026rdquo; John said, waving at Gail and Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Petra and Michael, head for the Home Caves and get ready to receive the last of our stuff down the chimney,\u0026rdquo; Gail ordered. \u0026ldquo;Pat, can you and Michael collect the last of our stuff here and haul it up to the chimney?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re on it,\u0026rdquo; Pat and John said in unison.\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe, I need you to come with me,\u0026rdquo; Gail smiled. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re going to prepare some surprises for our guests.\u0026rdquo;\nPetra could barely contain her excitement. She was wearing a bikini, and it looked spectacular! She felt a twinge of guilt as she thought of the original owner of the bright pink suit, but she put that thought aside; she could do nothing about the past. She reveled in the weight of her large breasts, as they pulled at the strap around her neck, and the way the bikini forced her bulging breasts together in a deep and warm cleavage.\n\u0026ldquo;Petra,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked from down the passageway, \u0026ldquo;have you put all of your pod\u0026rsquo;s stuff away?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; she answered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just trying on some clothes.\u0026rdquo;\nPhoebe turned the corner to see Petra, her former Uncle Peter but who was now her same biological sex and age, posing along side one of the hundreds of tidal pools that were all interconnected in this Swiss cheese system of caves and tunnels.\n\u0026ldquo;You look beautiful,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;I spent most of my youth wanting to go to the nude beach so I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to wear a swim suit, and you \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Waited my whole life to have to wear one,\u0026rdquo; Petra giggled. \u0026ldquo;And now that I can, but there\u0026rsquo;s no need.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t your back hurt?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked as she noticed the straining straps to Petra\u0026rsquo;s bikini top. Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts were nearly level with her chin, as Petra\u0026rsquo;s 5' 11' frame towered over Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s 5' 6''.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Petra answered. \u0026ldquo;Why do you ask?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The straps,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe prompted. \u0026ldquo;My gills are so sensitive, I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine tying anything across them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Petra smiled and turned, showing Phoebe where she had taken a folded silk blouse to cushion the lower strap as it crossed her gills.\n\u0026ldquo;That kinda means we can\u0026rsquo;t wear clothes that cross our backs.\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I am afraid so,\u0026rdquo; Petra answered. \u0026ldquo;Even with this super soft silk, I can still feel where the tie digs into me. I just wanted to try it once.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t pout,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe urged, coming over to hug her former uncle. \u0026ldquo;You have the most beautiful breasts here, and it would be a shame to cover them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Phoebe,\u0026rdquo; Petra breathed, \u0026ldquo;I know all this has been really strange, and really difficult, but I am so happy now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am too, Petra,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe admitted. \u0026ldquo;I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve lost a kind and sweet uncle, along with the rest of our family, but I\u0026rsquo;ve gained a beautiful and caring sister.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or cousin,\u0026rdquo; Petra said with a sly smile. \u0026ldquo;A kissing cousin?\u0026rdquo;\nPhoebe started \u0026hellip; she hadn\u0026rsquo;t really thought about that \u0026hellip; kissing Peter/Petra? Why did that thought appeal to her? She struggled internally for a moment before Petra put the matter to rest.\n\u0026ldquo;Kissing cousins,\u0026rdquo; she said firmly as she lifted Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s face with her hands and bent down to kiss her deeply.\nPhoebe physically enjoyed the kiss, and the pressure of Petra\u0026rsquo;s enormous breasts filling the space between the tops of her own and her chin, but emotionally, she was thinking of Danni and Pat. She wondered how all this would work itself out. Petra too enjoyed the gentle tease of naughty thoughts that played across her imagination as she kissed her surprised former niece, but she also felt the emotional tug of her bonds to Michael and Gail.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps more someday?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe answered with a smile.\nThe next morning, Pat, Danni, and Phoebe were pouring through the diary in the Chimney Cave, reading by the sunlight that cascaded down from above, trying to learn all they could about the family that had met a terrible end, dangling their feet into the pool in the center of the room. Gail, who had been manning the listening tubes the previous evening, reported that the boats had reached the abandoned sailboat on the eastern arm after sunset, but everyone must have stayed aboard. No new sounds or voices had been heard.\nJohn pulled up through the pool in the middle of the room with a powerful kick, and landed with a thud next to Pat at the edge of the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re getting to be quite the swimmer,\u0026rdquo; she remarked as water sluiced off John\u0026rsquo;s shining skin and hair.\n\u0026ldquo;They are making landfall even now, and they should find the remains of our beach camp shortly,\u0026rdquo; he reported.\n\u0026ldquo;Could you see who they were?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I stayed at the point, keeping watch,\u0026rdquo; John explained, \u0026ldquo;while Michael went in for a closer look. He should be right behind me.\u0026rdquo;\nMichael burst through the tunnel below their feet and, like John, leapt up-dolphin style-to land next to John. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s them,\u0026rdquo; he said simply.\n\u0026ldquo;How many?\u0026rdquo; asked Gail as she burst into the room, followed quickly by Petra.\n\u0026ldquo;At least two dozen, mostly men, well armed, and a few women,\u0026rdquo; he reported. \u0026ldquo;There also appeared to be five captives, including those three,\u0026rdquo; he said pointing at the photograph in the diary that Pat held on her lap.\n\u0026ldquo;Really,\u0026rdquo; cried Phoebe. \u0026ldquo;Ohmygod! Who were the other two, their parents?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Michael replied with a sigh. \u0026ldquo;They appeared to be Asian girls, young, looked Chinese.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We HAVE to help them,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe urged, remembering her own time of captivity.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Gail said calmly. \u0026ldquo;We do.\u0026rdquo;\nPat knew better than to argue with Gail when she spoke in that tone of voice. So, she did one better. \u0026ldquo;Then we are going to need information,\u0026rdquo; she said quietly, \u0026ldquo;a lot of information.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We should be hearing from them shortly,\u0026rdquo; Gail replied, with a sly smile to Michael.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Michael said to Gail\u0026rsquo;s smile, \u0026ldquo;I set the trip wires as soon as I knew who they were.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; asked Petra just as a distant explosion echoed down their chimney. Everyone looked at the patch of sky above as though they might actually see the smoke from the explosion.\n\u0026ldquo;Gail,\u0026rdquo; asked Pat with a sly grin. \u0026ldquo;What kind of surprises did you leave for our guests?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, just some things that Phoebe, Michael, and I whipped up, nothing special,\u0026rdquo; Gail said with a fierce grin that no one thought was supposed to be funny.\nThe criminals had found the old beach camp, and had assumed that it had been long abandoned. When they crossed the dilapidated threshold of the hut, the two men who had been carrying supplies from the boat to the hut disappeared in a violent explosion. When the smoke had cleared, everyone was on high alert. The captives were put back on the main boat, and Alberto had them all locked in a small cabin until he could sort things out. He marshaled his men, and two women who were members of his gang, into three search parties with strict instructions to search the island carefully, watching for booby traps.\nThey spent the next three days combing through the island, finding several nasty surprises that Gail, Michael, and Phoebe had left for them. Some worked great, like the one on the family\u0026rsquo;s boat that had drifted ashore. The other half of the gasoline that was left on the boat made for an equally fine explosion as the one at the beach hut. Two men lost their lives there, and one of the women was burned, but not badly. Some didn\u0026rsquo;t work so well, like the one at the mountainside camp: that only cost one of the men a finger.\nAlberto and his men had learned to fear the island, but they couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sure if anyone was still there, especially as they could circle the island, more or less, in a single day. They were hoping to lie low for a few weeks, and let the heat die down from various law enforcement agencies looking for them. He and his gang were based mostly in the Philippines, but they did business from Shanghai to Sydney. This tiny, remote island was as good a hideout as any, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t appear on any of the nautical maps. However, the old booby traps that were set for someone were an unpleasant surprise.\nThe Henderson\u0026rsquo;s boat had been another unpleasant surprise. Alberto had thought it sank weeks ago, but finding it here seemed a bad omen, one that had turned out to be true. Some one had deliberately set those booby traps, which meant that some one was on the island within the last month. He wanted to leave, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t. The two large yachts in which the gang had arrived had only enough gas for the next jump to Palau. If they spent time searching for yet another of the over 600 small, volcanic islands in the South Pacific, they might run out of gas and be stranded.\nOn the plus side, the lagoon was perfect, and new beach huts were easily and quickly constructed. Soon, the remaining 15 members of the gang, plus their five captives, were lodged comfortably, if warily, in seven new beach huts along the lagoon. Satisfied that they had found or tripped most of the booby traps, they settled down to wait for either the return of those who had set the traps, or the heat to die down so they could resume their activities. Alberto thought two months or so should do the trick. In the mean time, the two Henderson girls and the two Chinese girls would provide him and a select few of his men some recreation. The boy, on the other hand, served the needs of two of his men who were so inclined to enjoy the fruits of young boys.\nThat was their lagoon, damnit!\nPat was fuming as she swam back to the caves after reconnoitering the activities in the lagoon. Those bastards were soiling their lagoon, with their loud nights, drunken brawls, and gunshots into the sky. God damn them! They could hear the cries of the teenagers each time one of the gang members took them, even the boy. His screams were the worst. She wanted them dead and gone, but they couldn\u0026rsquo;t do much until they could figure out how to rescue the five teenagers without getting themselves or the children killed.\nThe two pods were beginning to feel their own form of cabin fever. It had been nearly a month since Alberto and his men had arrived. The pods had to be very careful during the day, and so they missed the sunlight. They had been cooped up, more or less, for over three weeks, and they were beginning to get on edge. They all took long swims on the west and northern sides of the island, but there were few places safe to make landfall, or even rocks on which to sun themselves. They knew that only a small portion of beach was invisible to any lookouts high on the mountain. They stayed out of the lagoons on the south side during the day for the same reason. Their bodies would be visible in the crystal clear water to any clear eyed lookout, and they knew from the listening tubes that Alberto had someone at the hot tub nearly 24 hours a day.\nThey had taken to eating almost entirely from the sea, in part, because they didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to need any fresh water if they ate seaweed, raw fish, and shellfish, and in part, because they knew that their stores of dried fruit and fish couldn\u0026rsquo;t last as long as Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men could survive on the bounty of the island now denied to them. And, no one wanted to give away their position by making a fire. Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men had guns; whereas they only had knives, and too few of them. Quickly, however, they got used to a diet of fresh seafood and sea grasses. Phoebe loved it. But she was the only one. Everyone, even Phoebe, wanted the gang gone and their island back.\nIt was a full moon, and Michael\u0026rsquo;s pod were spying on the lagoon, watching the beach for any activity, and hoping for the rare opportunity to capture one of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men. Petra didn\u0026rsquo;t like such tasks, but she did keep watch with her two pod mates. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t there two weeks ago when one of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men had decided to take a midnight swim, alone. Many of the men and the two women had gone swimming at night, but Gail could hardly believe her eyes as she lay hidden among the palm fronds on the western arm of the lagoon when she saw a lone man enter the water. She silently slipped into the water and swam to the eastern arm to rouse Michael from his watch, but-as was usual for the two of them-he had had the same idea and they met in the middle of the lagoon\u0026rsquo;s opening to the reefs off shore.\nWhen the gang had discovered the body of their comrade the next morning, they wondered what kind of fish could have breached the barrier reefs to inflict such horrific damage to a human body. No one had gone swimming alone again.\nPetra had cried over the cuts on Gail\u0026rsquo;s and Michael\u0026rsquo;s legs from where they had fought with the man under water, as they dragged him down to the coral reefs. She was grateful that her generous breasts could help heal her pod mates, and she was determined not to let her own distaste for violence prevent her from being with her pod. Neither Gail nor Michael ever suggested or pressured her to participate, but she could tell that they both were grateful that she had joined them on their patrols. In truth, both Michael and Gail had come to depend on Petra\u0026rsquo;s gentle nature to balance their own, and her welcoming kisses and caresses eased their long simmering painful memories.\nBack in the caves, John\u0026rsquo;s pod had gathered in the chimney room, unable to sleep, and this was the only room in which any light appeared. The moon slowly slipped across the sky until to was directly above the chimney opening. The effect was stunning, casting a perfect reflection onto the surface of the pool in the center of the room. As one, John and the girls slipped into the water and sank into the pool. It was a large pool, about 15 meters wide, nearly a perfect circle, and about 30 meters deep, with many different tunnels that branched off of the pool in several directions, the largest tunnel leading almost directly to the sea, about 100 meters to the west.\nThe four of them floated in the pale, otherworldly light, holding hands and entwining their feet as they clung close to each other.\n\u0026ldquo;This is beautiful,\u0026rdquo; marveled Phoebe. \u0026ldquo;We should call this the Moon Pool.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are all beautiful,\u0026rdquo; said John as he gazed at each of them.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s been ages since we made love,\u0026rdquo; Danni said quietly into the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; sighed Pat. \u0026ldquo;Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men have put a damper on many things.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not going to let them win that fight,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, and put action to issue by sinking down to John\u0026rsquo;s cock, and sucking it into her mouth. John responded quickly, and soon he was at full erection. Danni and Pat joined their pod mate at John\u0026rsquo;s crotch, while John looked at these beautiful women who swirled in the water below him, stroking his legs with their hands and sharing his stiff cock among the three of them. Pat\u0026rsquo;s rich auburn hair had lost some of her red highlights during the past four weeks of hiding, but it still shone in the moonlight like a beacon. Danni\u0026rsquo;s golden hair was matched by Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s nearly white blonde mane, and he enjoyed the beginnings of his first orgasm building up pressure behind his balls.\nPat looked lovingly at her pod mates and at John\u0026rsquo;s stiff cock that reached nine inches into the water, nearly as thick as her wrist. She shared a deep kiss with Phoebe as Danni took John into her mouth, then stroked Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s breasts as she had a turn, and then was stroked by Phoebe as she took John back into her own mouth. She loved the warmth of John\u0026rsquo;s body, his strength and size, and she loved the gentle caresses from Phoebe and Danni as she stroked her lover\u0026rsquo;s cock. She looked up to John\u0026rsquo;s eyes as he floated above them, and sucked hard on his sensitive head. Her efforts, as she suspected, were instantly rewarded as John spurted into her mouth. One, two, three big pulses in quick succession, then two smaller ones.\nShe kept John\u0026rsquo;s salty goodness in her mouth, savoring his heat, and turned to the girls, who attacked her face and lips, eager for a taste of their own. When they had shared John\u0026rsquo;s gift, they guided Phoebe up to John\u0026rsquo;s face, his still stiff cock poking her in her crotch. Pat floated behind John, pulling Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s legs apart and holding them on either side of John\u0026rsquo;s waist, while Danni pressed herself into Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s back, reaching between her and John to guide his stiff pole into Phoebe. Both John and Phoebe simply floated while Pat and Danni did all the work. Pat and Danni locked their legs together and pressed their soft breasts into John\u0026rsquo;s and Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s gills. With their hands they guided Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s hips back and forth, stroking John\u0026rsquo;s cock against her clit and G-spot, and she lasted only a few moments before shaking violently in her orgasm, milk spurting from her breasts. Then it was Danni\u0026rsquo;s turn, and she too only lasted a few minutes before she was groaning in her own orgasm. Then it was Pat\u0026rsquo;s turn.\nPat let herself go limp, giving all power of movement to the other girls as she felt Danni\u0026rsquo;s long nipples poking her in her gills. An involuntary tremor ran through her body as she felt Danni\u0026rsquo;s hands hold her wide hips steady, while Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s gentle touch on her ankles pulled her legs around John\u0026rsquo;s strong, slender waist. She gazed lovingly into John\u0026rsquo;s eyes as she felt the flowering of her sex as John\u0026rsquo;s stiff penis pushed past her outer lips. Then the girls froze. Only the tip of John\u0026rsquo;s magnificent penis was inside her, and she wanted more \u0026hellip; she needed more. She twitched her hips, trying to force more of him inside her without actually moving herself, which was not part of this game.\n\u0026ldquo;Uh, oh,\u0026rdquo; whispered Danni into her ear, nibbling on her lob, \u0026ldquo;You know the rules. Let us do it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Please \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Pat whimpered as John brought his hands up to her breasts, softly rubbing and pulling on her nipples. \u0026ldquo;Aaaaaahhhh \u0026hellip; please.\u0026rdquo;\nPat loved the way her breasts felt full and heavy with passion, nearly to the bursting, as John pushed, pulled, and caressed her breasts. Danni\u0026rsquo;s hands on her hips rose up to Pat\u0026rsquo;s slender waist and caressed her stomach, teasing at the tufts of hair at the top of her vagina. Phoebe pulled a tiny bit on her legs, and John sank another inch into her. Pat concentrated on letting her lovers make love to her, and she relaxed into the delicious tension that was building in her abdomen. Phoebe pulled again, and John gasped as his head pushed past Pat\u0026rsquo;s engorged G-Spot. Pat admired the soft glow of moonlight on John\u0026rsquo;s chest and face; she was so in love. Phoebe pulled again, and Pat\u0026rsquo;s legs began to quiver even as she struggled not to move. Pat could see the teasing vixen\u0026rsquo;s hair floating behind John\u0026rsquo;s broad shoulders, and she knew that Phoebe was pushing her breasts into John\u0026rsquo;s gills, making him quiver in pleasure. Phoebe pulled again, and John\u0026rsquo;s shaft was now over halfway in, and Danni could feel Pat\u0026rsquo;s internal muscles jumping and twitching as she applied pressure to Pat\u0026rsquo;s womb with her hands. Phoebe pulled again, and John\u0026rsquo;s shaft swelled as he fought to hold back his own orgasm. Phoebe pulled again, and they were joined. Pat\u0026rsquo;s clit was tingling, throbbing, aching to be rubbed, but Danni and Phoebe held them frozen in place.\nJohn\u0026rsquo;s hands had stopped moving and were clenched on Pat\u0026rsquo;s breasts as he focused on not cuming. His face was twisted with effort. Pat gazed down at her breasts, captured by John\u0026rsquo;s strong hands, her nipples straining into the water, milk oozing from one in anticipation of the orgasm that was hurtling towards her like a steam engine roaring down the tracks. She saw her own belly twitching under Danni\u0026rsquo;s gentle pressure, and could even see where her lips had stretched around John\u0026rsquo;s massive cock as it throbbed within her. They hung there for an eternity, it seemed, when John let out a shout into the water, bubbles rising to the surface, as his cock exploded into her.\nAs the first pulse of cum shot through his cock, Pat could feel the swell of effort as it throbbed through his penis like a golf ball through a hose. When his hot cum splashed on her cervix, she could hold back no longer, and her orgasm rose from her depths like storm, wracking her body with pleasure, making her quiver like a tuning fork as Danni and Phoebe held them together, locked in their loving embraces. And she could feel the sudden release in her breasts as she spurted milk into the water as she shuddered again and again, moaning into the water.\nThe next morning the two pods were back in the chimney room, discussing what Michael\u0026rsquo;s pod had seen. The men were erecting huts that were more permanent, and it seemed as though they were hunkering down for a long stay. Now the two pods were sitting around dejected. They only had a few knives for weapons, and despite being strong swimmers who could breath underwater; it had been a near miss for Michael and Gail to drag one of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men under the surf. Since the gang members never swam alone, and the captive teenagers were always guarded, they didn\u0026rsquo;t know how they were going to change the balance of power.\nBut, it was later that morning when John, who had been out foraging for food, changed the dynamic of this cat and mouse game they were playing when he shot up out of the newly christened \u0026ldquo;Moon pool\u0026rdquo; and plopped next to Pat sitting at the edge of the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;Look,\u0026rdquo; he said calmly. \u0026ldquo;My hands are changing.\u0026rdquo;\nPat looked at his hands and then at the silent friends and lovers that sat all around the pool. Everyone was looking at John\u0026rsquo;s hands. The webbing had risen nearly to his fingernails, and his hands seemed larger. Pat rolled his hands in hers, comparing their webbing. She too had noticed the slightly accelerated speed at which this new development was occurring. She wondered if their activities last night had had any effect. Danni moved her own hands over to theirs before Pat could ask. Soon, everyone was holding his or her own hands out for comparison.\nPetra, who spent less time in the water than anyone else, had the least amount of webbing. Pat and John, who had been under the effects of the goop the longest, were the most advanced. Danni was only slightly behind John and Pat, but Michael, Gail, and Phoebe, all of whom spent nearly all their time in the water, spying on Alberto and his men and collecting food for the others, were the same as Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Length of exposure to the goop and the types of behavior we engage in seem to influence what each of us are undergoing,\u0026rdquo; she concluded.\n\u0026ldquo;What does this mean?\u0026rdquo; asked Petra with a gulp.\n\u0026ldquo;If we keep this up, this hiding and being in the water all the time,\u0026rdquo; Pat said without emotion, \u0026ldquo;we will keep on changing into whatever this goop has in store for us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, we won\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said firmly.\n\u0026ldquo;Why do you think that?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat with a raised eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;Because, Petra didn\u0026rsquo;t just change \u0026hellip; she made herself change into someone she wanted to become,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Michael too! I\u0026rsquo;ll be right back,\u0026rdquo; she said as she dove into the pool and swam down one of the several tunnels that fed this central cavern.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to become a fish,\u0026rdquo; Petra said fearfully, \u0026ldquo;I just became a woman, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to change that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No one wants to become a fish,\u0026rdquo; Pat said patiently, \u0026ldquo;But we are all becoming something.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like to see what Phoebe wants?\u0026rdquo; Gail said evenly. \u0026ldquo;I would rather try to actively influence our changes than simply wait for them happen while we hid here in these caves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I would too,\u0026rdquo; said Michael, giving Gail\u0026rsquo;s hand a squeeze.\nPhoebe rushed back through the water, popped up and slid to a stop like a dolphin next to Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Here, look at these pictures,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said enthusiastically as she took the book out from the plastic bag she had sealed it within. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what I want to become.\u0026rdquo;\nThe picture was the classic 19th century picture of the beautiful mermaid, gazing out to sea, wishing her sailor would return. Her golden tail curled beneath her, and her hourglass figure, even for the 19th century, was beautiful. Her long, curly, dark hair cascaded down her back. She was a beautiful creature. Her tail had two sets of fins at her pelvis and at mid-tail, while her flukes were wide and strong.\n\u0026ldquo;See, it looks like these tails actually work, and they are still beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe urged.\n\u0026ldquo;Why not still keep our ability to walk?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Because,\u0026rdquo; Gail said with new insight, \u0026ldquo;we can dominate and fully control one environment, the water, if we give ourselves the power to do so. We would have sea power; they would have land power. They have guns, which don\u0026rsquo;t work underwater,\u0026rdquo; she finished with a smile.\n\u0026ldquo;I think they\u0026rsquo;re just plain beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Petra said. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be a fish, but I do want to be one of those.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t think we can do it,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;I think we can,\u0026rdquo; John said.\n\u0026ldquo;What makes you say that?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You yourself didn\u0026rsquo;t just change,\u0026rdquo; John explained. \u0026ldquo;You changed into something close to my girlfriend in college, and your family doesn\u0026rsquo;t have red hair or green eyes in their gene pool. You changed because that\u0026rsquo;s what I wanted you to change into.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then the changes aren\u0026rsquo;t random,\u0026rdquo; Pat whispered, understanding. \u0026ldquo;We could do it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Great!\u0026rdquo; said Phoebe, \u0026ldquo;Just tell me what to do. I\u0026rsquo;ll go first.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How about you tell me,\u0026rdquo; Pat said assuming her teaching voice, as Danni and the others rolled their eyes. \u0026ldquo;We have been working on ideas related to this issue for weeks.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We have?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe, confused.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat repeated. \u0026ldquo;And last night\u0026rsquo;s activities might help you figure it out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sex?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; said Pat gently, \u0026ldquo;but more than that. What\u0026rsquo;s happened to our bodies, especially when we have sex.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We make goop,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe exclaimed.\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; said Pat, \u0026ldquo;and?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Each of our bodies are producing goop in our bodily fluids,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe continued. \u0026ldquo;In fact, the ratio of active agent to non-reactive agents in our breast milk, semen, and female ejaculate is increasing, so that even our minor scraps and cuts heal nearly instantly. What used to take several hours to heal is now healed in minutes,\u0026rdquo; she finished with a smile at Michael and Gail who had needed healing only a few days ago.\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Pat responded. \u0026ldquo;So, how could we compress this slow build up of active agents in our bodies so that we can \u0026ldquo;control\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;force\u0026rdquo; the change, as Petra, Michael, and apparently John did?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought I would have become a woman anyway,\u0026rdquo; Petra interrupted. \u0026ldquo;I only imagined what kind of woman I might become.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have become a woman if you had a bigger body mass than John, or if we had sent you off alone with girls who were willing to let you remain a man,\u0026rdquo; Pat corrected. \u0026ldquo;In fact, your transition was much quicker than mine or Danni\u0026rsquo;s, in part, I think, because you were becoming a specific woman, not just a woman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, in order to become that mermaid, we should ingest as much milk and other bodily fluids as we can stand, and then try to \u0026ldquo;will\u0026rdquo; the change,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;Wow \u0026hellip; that might actually work.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure this is what you want?\u0026rdquo; asked Petra. \u0026ldquo;What if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are changing anyway,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe pointed out, indicating her own webbing. \u0026ldquo;This way, at least I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing something about it. I have to at least try. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be an ugly, flesh colored fish.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think we should all participate,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\n\u0026ldquo;What, all of us trying to change right now?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I think that both our combined fluids and our combined focus and energy might give Phoebe a better chance of controlling the results,\u0026rdquo; he answered. \u0026ldquo;When I was changing into Michael, I could feel the energy from Danni and Phoebe. I could sense how they wanted me to change, what they wanted me to change into, and all that energy and focus seemed to make it actually possible.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Michael\u0026rsquo;s right,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;And this, our Home Cave, our Moon Pool, is the perfect spot to try. We can all easily fit into this pool, and if it works, Phoebe can easily reach any passageway for easy access to most of the other rooms in this network of caves and pools. Besides, it\u0026rsquo;s the only pool with good light, and it will help her concentrate on what she is doing to herself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, what should we do?\u0026rdquo; asked Gail.\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone in the pool, and we can breathe through our gills,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Then we can start feeding Phoebe.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wait,\u0026rdquo; Gail said. \u0026ldquo;Phoebe, there is something I want you to add.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;As you imagine the mermaid you will become, think of a barb in your tail, something like a sting ray, so that we have a weapon of the water,\u0026rdquo; Gail said.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a great idea,\u0026rdquo; Pat added. \u0026ldquo;As you focus on your beautiful tail, think about how strong it is, and think about how warm you will be, even in deep water, and focus your thoughts on a barb that you can use to paralyze attackers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean, make it non-lethal?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Paralysis is lethal if the attacker isn\u0026rsquo;t rescued,\u0026rdquo; Gail said with a grim smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Makes sense,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to kill every time I used it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you ready,\u0026rdquo; asked Pat. She nodded. \u0026ldquo;Right, then everyone look at this picture again, and hold it firmly in your minds. You did want the purple or golden color?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Blue,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, glancing again at the pictures. \u0026ldquo;To match my eyes. Let\u0026rsquo;s do it.\u0026rdquo; And then she dove head first into the water and settled a few meters below the surface.\n\u0026ldquo;That may be the last time she\u0026rsquo;s able to do that,\u0026rdquo; John mused.\n\u0026ldquo;It could be the last time any of us can,\u0026rdquo; Pat said as she dove in headfirst as well.\nThey all settled at the middle of the pool, the dim light cascading down from the chimney high above. Phoebe swam towards Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re the mother of us all, the first to be changed, and so you will be first here,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Give me my tail,\u0026rdquo; she whispered as she attached herself to Pat\u0026rsquo;s breast and sucked.\nPat felt the familiar stirrings of warmth, and fullness spread to her breasts. Phoebe was forcefully pulling milk from her breast, and after a few minutes, switched quickly to the other. When that one was dry, she moved to Gail.\n\u0026ldquo;You are the mother to the second pod,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Will you be my second?\u0026rdquo;\nGail nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;Then give me my tail,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe intoned as she latched onto her breasts. This was Gail\u0026rsquo;s first time as a feeder, and she was surprised by the tender and powerful feelings that Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s suckling evoked. Even so, she only produced a little milk, and Phoebe soon emptied her. She next swam to Petra.\n\u0026ldquo;Here, Phoebe,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, lifting her breasts in the water. \u0026ldquo;Show us how it\u0026rsquo;s done.\u0026rdquo;\nPhoebe smiled and said, \u0026ldquo;My sister-uncle, give me my tail,\u0026rdquo; as she fell onto one of Petra\u0026rsquo;s enormous breasts. Petra drew a sharp breath and exhaled sharply, moaning into the pool. It was her first time as a feeder as well, and the physiological triggers were much different than mere sex play. She knew that her breasts were pumping a fluid into Phoebe that would transform her forever, and such a thought was intoxicating. She stroked Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s hair as she suckled at her large breast, and she could feel the milk streaming from her large nipples.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a good thing we have gills,\u0026rdquo; remarked Pat. \u0026ldquo;Otherwise Petra would drown us with her milk.\u0026rdquo;\nPetra merely smiled through heavily lidded eyes at Pat as Phoebe continued her feeding. Meanwhile, Gail and Pat shared a quick look, and floated down below the circle, under Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s gently twirling legs. Together they reached up and began rubbing them lengthwise, Gail on her back side, Pat at the front. Phoebe moaned into Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts as the other girls stimulated her skin, helping her focus her building energies onto her lower body. She fixed in her mind, the beautiful and strong mermaid, tireless swimmer, able to withstand deep ocean pressures and cold temperatures, and who had a hidden secret at where her tail and her fluke met, the junction before it fanned out. Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts were indeed generous, and Phoebe could feel the energy building in her. She switched to Petra\u0026rsquo;s other breast, and found fresh vigor in those streams. When Petra\u0026rsquo;s massive breasts finally gave out, Phoebe reached for Michael, who was already stiff watching this erotic dance in the water before him.\n\u0026ldquo;You took my virginity,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe half sang, as though in a trance, \u0026ldquo;Now, take from me my legs.\u0026rdquo; She swallowed him to the hilt. Within seconds, he was spurting great ropes of cum down her throat. The combination of Michael\u0026rsquo;s salty cum with the girls' sweet milk sent Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s head spinning. Pat and Gail were still rubbing her legs, which now began to feel very warm, and her pelvis began to twitch internally. Phoebe redoubled her focus on her vision of the mermaid she wanted to become, and reached for John.\n\u0026ldquo;Come, brother-husband,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe sang with a languid, trance-like passion, \u0026ldquo;give me my tail.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn\u0026rsquo;s cock was nearly vibrating with need from watching this incredible sight of Phoebe practically glowing in the pool before him. She pulled him into her mouth, and immediately he was cuming. He roared into the water as his torso twisted and pushed great spurts of cum into the eager Phoebe. When he was spent, Phoebe twisted gracefully in the water to face Danni. Her skin was glowing; they could all see it. Her blonde hair floated like a halo, her eyes shone with an inner light.\n\u0026ldquo;Come, my first feeder, my sister-wife,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe sang into the water, her eyes drooping heavily, her entire body quivering with passion and the effort to control the powerful forces that now surged through her body. Her legs were beginning to stiffen, her toes together, pointing at the bottom of the pool. She could feel Pat and Gail rubbing them lightly, up and down, up and down. \u0026ldquo;Come, my first, be my last, and give me my tail.\u0026rdquo;\nDanni floated forward as in a trance; the entire pool was charged with passion and power. When Phoebe attached herself to her breast, Danni swooned with the power of the moment. She orgasmed violently, feeling her breasts and vagina swell and shoot milk and cum into the water, but Phoebe held on to her with both control and tenderness, drinking deep from Danni\u0026rsquo;s breast. Pat and Gail started humming, and soon Petra and the boys joined in. Deep within her chest, Danni felt a sound rise and vibrate past her lips into the water. Phoebe, delirious with passion, felt Danni\u0026rsquo;s chest vibrate as she suckled milk from her nipple. The milk came in great spurts, like cum from the boys, matching Danni\u0026rsquo;s still rippling orgasms. Her other breast, the one Phoebe was not attached to, simply spurted milk into the water.\nWhen Danni stopped shaking, Phoebe pulled back \u0026hellip; moaning. She stretched her arms out horizontally, even with the surface, while her toes were stiffly pointed towards the bottom, suspended in the middle of the circle, surrounded by her pods who were humming a low tone into the water while the last of Danni\u0026rsquo;s milk swirled in the water around Phoebe. Pat and Gail drifted back up to their places in the circle, and they all watched, and waited.\nPhoebe appeared to be frozen in the water, her skin rippling with the energies she had consumed. Under the surface of her skin, she could feel great tremors of movement and muscles, energy and electricity running throughout her body. For her, time seemed to stop completely. Her eyes were open but sightless, focused on her vision of the beautiful, powerful, mermaid. Her mouth hung open in the water, her hands were out thrust in the light, while her rigid legs pointed directly to the bottom. She could feel the others around her, supporting her, loving her. Still, the great waves of movement rippled through her body.\nTo the others, Phoebe seemed suspended, frozen in the water. They knew time was passing, but they kept their vigil, kept humming, in the dim light from the sun as it slowly passed through the sky. After several hours, Phoebe moaned loudly into the water as a slow-motion twitch rolled through her body, and then she resumed her quivering rigidity. A few more hours passed before they could see that nearly imperceptible changes had begun to occur.\nInternally, Phoebe felt no time pass. She had felt a great urge to push, and she moaned loudly into the water as she pushed with her diaphragm. As though in a dream-like slow motion, she felt her womb spasm with the most intense pleasure she had ever known, then her legs knit themselves together into a single unit, thousands of nerves, blood vessels, and cells pulling apart and pushing together, waves and waves pulsing through her legs and lower torso. The she felt her still pulsing womb slowly sink down a few inches as her vagina and other internal parts also moved forward and down. She could feel her gills tingling, her breasts up thrust in the water, her hair flowing down her back, and she could feel the presence of the others, helping, guiding, loving.\nA moment seemed to pass where she was calm, and then she felt the need to push again. She pushed, and this time felt the bones of her legs break and fuse, merging into a new structure, longer and fuller than it had been before. That hurt, but the power of the goop made it pass quickly, and she could feel new muscles snaking from the bottom of her tail up through her pelvis to anchor themselves both there and along her ribs and back. They felt like strands of thread as they twisted their way up through her upper body, while below her hips, in her tail, the same muscle felt like thick rope as it throbbed and grew.\nAnother moment, and then she felt another tremor, and knew that her feet had disappeared while two enormous flukes pushed out from her, while two side fins pushed out from her mid-tail, and two more at her hips, each about seven inches long and four inches wide. The tremendous energy that had coursed through her body\u0026rsquo;s core seemed to be pushing its way outward, making her skin tingle and twitch. Still, her body was rigid, vibrating with power, held in place by the forces she had marshaled to this task. Suddenly, a hot tremor flashed up through her torso and flowed out through her arms. Then another one bubbled up from her belly, crawling up through her chest, her neck, her face, and then out her skull and up through her floating hair. Another \u0026ldquo;moment\u0026rdquo; passed, and then she shuddered throughout her entire body, and arched her entire body backwards in a great release of ecstasy. Her tail came back above her head as she curled backwards, and suddenly she could see it, see her tail, floating a foot above her head. It was beautiful, an iridescent blue, matching her eyes, and her scales and flukes flickering with light. And then, she straightened, free from the grip of the transformation.\nIt was nearly as good as an orgasm.\nIt took nearly twenty-four hours before Phoebe finally relaxed in the water before them. The entire day and night had passed as they watched her amazing transformation. For the longest time she had hung frozen before them, not moving, not even seeming to breathe. Then, her legs had fused together, slowly, steadily, for several hours. As the hours passed, her lower body lengthened and gained the proportions of a mermaid\u0026rsquo;s tail, just shy of five feet in length from her hips to her flukes, making her over seven feet long from head to flukes. As the early morning progressed, her \u0026ldquo;scales\u0026rdquo; appeared, starting at her waist and crawling slowly down over her hips and pelvic flippers, then down to her tailfin. Finally, her hands grew webbing, a small sharp fin appeared at her elbow, and her hair grew another foot.\nPat knew that whatever \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; the goop was doing, it was doing it far quicker than it had before. Perhaps their bodies were producing different or more powerful enzymes and antibodies that broke down existing tissue and helped the body rebuild itself quicker than it had occurred with herself and the others who had radically changed, like Danni, Petra, and Michael. Pat also noticed that she didn\u0026rsquo;t feel tired, despite the nearly constant humming they all had been doing, and that she felt strangely peaceful as Phoebe floated languidly in the pool, still giving off a faint luminescence. She was sure that their own bodies were already internally altered to give them this kind of stamina and energy.\nPat couldn\u0026rsquo;t think about science any longer, however, as she simply looked at the new Phoebe. She was the most beautiful creature Pat had ever seen, and it made her heart ache with eager desire to think that soon she would join her in transformation. It almost seemed magical, which made her even more determined to know how it was actually being done.\nThe entire group floated wordlessly in the water admiring Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s incredible beauty, her long and powerful tail that seemed to flash and glow in the pool, her delicately matching webbing in her fingers and fins at her elbows, now the same iridescent bright, blue. Her tail actually had many colors shimmering across its surface, but the sum of all the parts was a brilliant, sea blue. Her eyes had also changed, becoming more jewel like, still bright blue, making them seem otherworldly, almost hypnotic, and her white blonde hair was now at least four feet long. Her torso seemed even more delicate and feminine perched atop her strong, yet beautifully decorated tail. Her fins and flukes were edged with a series of feathery wisps of white that matched her long flowing hair, and along her dorsal ridge which now extended mid-way up her back like a widow\u0026rsquo;s peak, a similar mane of white membrane fluttered in the water. Her waist was still narrow and her rib cage slender; her breasts were unchanged, though the sheen of her skin was different. She was no longer human.\nPhoebe herself could feel dramatic changes in her body, too many to enumerate. She could see much more clearly than before, and could \u0026ldquo;sense\u0026rdquo; the electrical charges each of her mates made, each one identifiable without her having to turn her head. She could sense the shape and outline of the pool, and the tunnel of water that twisted and turned to the sea. She could sense a bit of the cliff wall, where the tunnel emerged about ten meters below the surface. She could feel some of these things with new organs that must be in her tail or elsewhere, and some senses that were simply her gills, eyes, and nose working more clearly and sharply than before. Most of all, she could feel her tail, the water moving over each area of it. Her scales where not fish-like but were more like skin, smooth and joined, more like a dolphin\u0026rsquo;s skin, and equally sensitive to touch. She could feel where her hair had brushed what used to be the top of her ass, but now was the top of her tail. She flexed her flukes, and they spread out below her like a Chinese fan, sending sparkles of color in every direction. She smiled at Pat, a dazzling smile of straight, white teeth, with surprisingly sharp and prominent eyeteeth.\n\u0026ldquo;Looks like the mermaid is armed with more than a barb,\u0026rdquo; Pat observed.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right, that,\u0026rdquo; said Phoebe with a silvery clarity, showing off her new vocal production that carried much more clearly in the water. She curled her tail forward, her pelvis still able to bend easily, while her lower tail flexed in every direction. She held her flukes open before her face, and where her flukes and tail joined, she spotted the dark spot where her barb lay hidden. There was a pleasant stiffness in the sheath-coiled spring that would snap forth at her command. It made her feel powerful.\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe, your voice?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked. \u0026ldquo;No air came out your mouth.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, none did,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, observing again that no air did.\n\u0026ldquo;How are you doing that?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Ever the scientist, eh Pat,\u0026rdquo; joked John as he gave her a hug. \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t we leave Phoebe some space to figure everything out before we start in on her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How long did it take me to change?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe worriedly.\n\u0026ldquo;About a day, more or less,\u0026rdquo; answered Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;No time for questions,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said urgently. \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t have time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean, Phoebe?\u0026rdquo; Gail asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but I sense that we must continue, here, now,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe sang in her silvery new voice. \u0026ldquo;We must all eat, and then begin again.\u0026rdquo;\nBy now, everyone had learned to trust the instincts they were feeling, and everyone swam up to the surface to gather food, and Phoebe discovered that she had quite a bit of mobility on dry land. She could flex her flukes and both sets of pelvic and mid-tail fins and, using all six points to bear her weight, \u0026ldquo;salamander\u0026rdquo; across dry land with ease and speed. Her fins seemed to easily support her weight, but she needed at least one hand for speedy locomotion, and using two was almost as fast as running. Her pelvis also flexed in both directions now, which explained why it hadn\u0026rsquo;t disappeared like in other sea mammals. She discovered, for example, that she could keep her upper torso vertical while rolling her tail horizontally across the floor.\nAfter everyone had eaten, they returned to the pool, this time with Gail at the center.\n\u0026ldquo;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t produce much milk for Phoebe,\u0026rdquo; Gail explained, \u0026ldquo;and so I want to be more of a partner for everyone. I think if I change next, I\u0026rsquo;ll produce better milk.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You produce the only milk I ever want,\u0026rdquo; Petra said with a passionate kiss. \u0026ldquo;You are my sister-wife, and don\u0026rsquo;t you forget it.\u0026rdquo;\nAs Gail tried to hide her own discomfort with such affection, everyone arranged themselves around her in the pool. Gail felt compelled to follow a similar format as Phoebe, addressing each of the pod members, starting with Michael and ending with Petra, asking them for her tail. When she got to Phoebe, everyone could sense that Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s milk was even more potent than their own fluids, and even Gail gasped with the effort of holding onto that power before she finished with Petra, whose generous breasts had already shown their bounty. Petra, like Danni with Phoebe, was locked into a cycle of orgasms as Gail drank from her breast last, her untended breast spurting into the water as Michael and John stroked Gail\u0026rsquo;s legs, helping her focus.\nGail was finished by the next morning, at least two hours earlier than Phoebe had finished. As she floated before the astonished group, she twirled on her flukes to give everyone a good view.\nGail\u0026rsquo;s long body was now nearly nine feet long (nearly three meters), and her tail was a midnight blue, shimmering with hints of purple and deep blues. With her white skin, jet back hair, smoldering violet jewel-like eyes, and mid-night black webbing on her fingers and fins at her elbows, she was stunning. Unlike Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s delicate white membranes along the edges of her fins, flukes, and dorsal ridge, Gail\u0026rsquo;s fins all sported sharp points, and the outer ends of her flukes terminated in a dangerous looking barbs. Her dorsal ridge was a soft, black velvet membrane, however, and like Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s, it also fluttered gently in the water. Her paralyzing barb rested in the same spot as Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s, and she too had sharp eyeteeth. Her nails also looked dangerous, while Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s had merely looked dramatic.\n\u0026ldquo;I want to be able to fight, and to use the cover of darkness to sneak up on enemies,\u0026rdquo; she explained. \u0026ldquo;The barbs on my fins and flukes are not toxic,\u0026rdquo; she continued, \u0026ldquo;But you don\u0026rsquo;t want to wrestle with me,\u0026rdquo; she finished, flexing her arms so that her elbow fins slashed through the water.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m next,\u0026rdquo; said Michael with a fierce look at his lover and mate.\nPat shuddered and arched herself backward, her iridescent sea-green tail vibrating above her head. Her body convulsed with the same orgasmic like release experienced by everyone else. Then, when she relaxed, she found herself floating within the most beautiful circle of fish and flesh, even with her now enhanced eyes, that she had ever seen.\nIn the bright moonlight, she could see Gail shining a rich midnight blue with her rich black highlights, while Michael was magnificent in shiny, obsidian black, his fins, flukes, and dorsal membrane tinged with a whisper of silver. Michael, now over ten feet long, also had a dorsal fin that he could raise or lower like a fan, rising out of what used to be his ass, matching the two pelvic fins that hung from where his hips had been. John had one too, and Pat had surmised that the dramatically stronger swimming ability the men had, might necessitate the additional stability a dorsal fin might provide. Finishing out Michael\u0026rsquo;s pod was Petra, luminous in rich, dark lavender with forest green highlights on her fins, flukes, and membrane.\nOf her own pod, Phoebe was still the stunningly bright sea-blue and white combination, while Danni was a rich yellow gold, her fins, flukes, and dorsal membrane a rainbow of colors, mostly a pale blue, flashing in the light. Danni\u0026rsquo;s eyes also changed, adding a multihued sparkle of many colors to her previously light blue eyes. John, her precious John, was a dark, steel-grey with blue and black highlights shot throughout, while his fins, flukes, and dorsal ridge flashed in the water like silver.\nPat relaxed and looked down at herself, feeling her yet again dramatically changed body. Her sea-green tail was tinged with pink highlights along her fins, flukes, and membrane, the occasional pale blue spot here and there. She savored the water in the pool that had been warmed by the five days they had spent together and the transformations each of them had undergone. She could now feel everyone\u0026rsquo;s electrical field, sense the water\u0026rsquo;s surface above her, the pool\u0026rsquo;s bottom below her, and the various tunnels the stretched out around her.\nShe noted as her tail shimmered in the moonlight, that her own transformation only took about 12 hours. Each transformed mermaid or merman had added to the increasing potency of their fluids, making them more and more powerful. She could see pinks and blues mixed in with the dominate pale greens, her hair had also lightened, becoming more red, off-setting her bright green eyes. She flexed her flukes, feeling the power and strength of her amazing tail, searching for and finding the pleasant coiled stiffness of her barb, hidden at the base of her tail.\nThey had done it. They were all changed.\n\u0026ldquo;We need to rest and recharge,\u0026rdquo; she said in her silvery new voice. Even as she spoke for the first time, she was cataloguing the sensations that told her that she had a new membrane in her throat that captured an air pocket around her vocal chords while she was underwater, allowing her to speak into her own head as an amplifier and resonator.\n\u0026ldquo;We can just sleep here,\u0026rdquo; Gail offered. \u0026ldquo;The pool is big enough, and the morning light will wake us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Besides,\u0026rdquo; Michael added. \u0026ldquo;The last of our food is here, and we have enough for one more meal.\u0026rdquo;\nTogether they all swam for the surface, and as the others had discovered after their transformations, Pat thrilled to the power and control her tail gave her. She gave quick flick of her tail and launched herself into the air, clearing the surface of the water, and sailed onto the smooth cave floor. She slid to where they had stacked the last of their dried fruit, nuts, and fish, and ate ravenously.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, it made me hungry too,\u0026rdquo; said John, as he \u0026ldquo;salamandered\u0026rdquo; up to her. Pat gave him a quick kiss and then returned to her fish.\nFinally, when they finished eating and were all feeling the strain of all the efforts they had expended, they thought about where to sleep.\n\u0026ldquo;I think we will be more comfortable in the water,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, having been a mermaid longer than anyone else. \u0026ldquo;But we should probably stay here as we can sense any intruder long before they reach us, whereas in the open sea, we might get surprised.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have been paying attention,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, giving her sister-wife a chuck on her shoulder. \u0026ldquo;And all this time I thought all you wanted to do is play with dolphins.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now I can REALLY play with the dolphins,\u0026rdquo; she said as she flipped backwards into the pool with a splash.\n\u0026ldquo;We all can, now,\u0026rdquo; Petra said as she slid more gracefully into the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Shall we?\u0026rdquo; John asked with mock politeness.\n\u0026ldquo;We shall,\u0026rdquo; Pat said grinning as the two of them salamandered to the pool, and slipped headfirst into the water.\nThey found that their new bodies had a neutral buoyancy that allowed them to float about five meters below the surface with no effort, and that they floated tail down. John and his girls drifted to one side of the pool while Michael and his went to the opposite side.\nAt first, they all just floated near one another, but one by one, each girl wrapped herself around John or Michael. Pat was first, leaning her head under John\u0026rsquo;s chin, and resting her palm on his broad chest. She twisted her tail around his, laying her flukes on the back of his still broad tail, nearly two feet above his one flukes. Then Danni snuggled onto John\u0026rsquo;s left shoulder, her tail entwined with his and Pat\u0026rsquo;s, and finally Phoebe snuggled on to his right shoulder, her tail lying over the top of everyone else\u0026rsquo;s.\nJohn cocked an eye open and saw Gail and Petra similarly wrapped around Michael. He thought he could see them moving against one another, when he felt a twinge in his tail. No \u0026hellip; it couldn\u0026rsquo;t be \u0026hellip; after five straight days awake, humming and feeding and changing?\nWhen John had finished his transformation, he knew that he still had a cock, and that it had grown yet again. Michael\u0026rsquo;s modest cock as a man had grown to nearly a foot long as a merman. When John gave Pat her last feeding, before she transformed (his first as a merman), he had discovered that he had to perform a quick tug on a new muscle to open a vent in his tail \u0026gt;from which his penis emerged. That first time he had nearly doubled over in pain because he didn\u0026rsquo;t open the vent until the last possible minute, and his rising cock had begun to hurt, trapped as it was inside him. His new cock was nearly 14 inches long, throbbing and pulsing. Pat had only been able to take a few inches into her mouth, but that was enough. When he came, mere seconds later, the orgasm seemed to start deep in his tail, and he could feel his semen rising from at least half way down. The increased distance had translated into increased pleasure, as far as he could tell, and a dramatically increased volume. He had enjoyed the feelings of stiffness that extended a good foot down into his tail, the throbbing blood engorged roots of his new penis.\nNow, with these three beautiful sister-wives all lovingly attached to him, with their flukes all stroking his tail just below where his testes probably were now lodged, he could feel the blood flow to his long and thick penis. It didn\u0026rsquo;t help when he felt Pat\u0026rsquo;s hand curl into a rake and begin to stroke his chest. He knew they should rest, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t help himself. He opened his vent before it became painful.\nPat was enjoying the warmth of her husband-lover, feeling his heartbeat with her cheek and hand, and the warmth of their entwined tails sliding against one another\u0026rsquo;s. She loved the feelings of Danni\u0026rsquo;s and Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s breasts as they brushed her elbow fins or pushed up against her own bulging breasts she was trying to grind into John\u0026rsquo;s chest. She recognized the signs of arousal quickly, having watched each new transformed mermaid become aroused as the next transformee fed from her breasts. Like the others had during the various transformations, Pat\u0026rsquo;s own breasts had visually swelled, filling with milk, pressing more firmly into John\u0026rsquo;s chest, while her now hidden lips within her tail swelled with blood, forcing a small opening to appear in her tail just below her pelvis. Her gills stiffened, gathering oxygen in preparation for the efforts of making love, which added to the sexual tension she was feeling. She knew without looking that her flukes had spread out, like a peacock\u0026rsquo;s tail, and were now quivering with sexual need. The first time she saw Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s tail quiver while she was feeding Gail, she wanted to know what that felt like.\nNow she did.\nShe gently curled her fingers and raked John\u0026rsquo;s beautiful chest with her sharp nails. Ah \u0026hellip; that did trick, she thought. John opened his vent, and his cock poked her in the tail. It felt hot, warmer than anything else she was pressing against. Before he could protest, and using the combined anchors of her sister-wives tail\u0026rsquo;s surrounding her own, she maneuvered herself in front of his cock, and slowly eased it into her now transformed vagina.\nShe had to stifle a moan, as she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to attract attention from Michael' pod, but she need not have worried. If she had looked, she would have seen that Gail had already beaten her by a half second. She raised her head and gazed into John\u0026rsquo;s steel grey eyes, flecked with flashes of silver, and kept up the steady pressure that was putting inch after inch of his cock into her. She felt Danni and Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s hands stroke her sides, fins, and breasts, and she turned to see each of them smiling at her with love.\nPat felt John\u0026rsquo;s cock begin to vibrate and saw that Danni\u0026rsquo;s eyes had also widened with surprise, then lidded over with pleasure as she softly moaned. Pat turned and watched as Phoebe did the same thing, and then looked down to where her own body had nearly swallowed John\u0026rsquo;s enormous and now vibrating cock. Because there was still about two inches to go, she could see that John\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fins were fluttering, vibrating as his cock was inside her, but that the tip of his fins were now pressed to the girl\u0026rsquo;s vents, and were rubbing their clits.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not doing that on purpose,\u0026rdquo; John whispered in awe.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not complaining,\u0026rdquo; whispered Pat as she pushed hard against him and buried the last two inches inside her. Both girls on either side nodded in wordless agreement, too overcome with lust to speak.\nThe moment their genitals made contact, Pat could feel her newly positioned clit vibrate with pleasure, and she knew why Danni and Phoebe were having nearly as good a time as she was. Still, she was the one with John\u0026rsquo;s penis buried deep within body, and so she began to move her velvet grip back and forth along his great length. All four of their flukes were now vibrating, casting shimmering reflections of moonlight all around them. The gentle motions of their tails combined with the fluttering dorsal membranes caused their tangled, tower of passion to twirl slowly in the water.\nPat was dimly aware of Petra, Gail, and Michael locked in a similar embrace, and once or twice she saw them when the gentle spinning caused by their entwined, vibrating tails brought the other group into her field of vision. She could also sense their altered electrical fields, and that added to the incredible feelings of sensuality she was experiencing. She kept up her gentle stroking, feeling the great bulbous head of John\u0026rsquo;s cock reach nearly to her diaphragm, filling her completely, stretching her. As her passion built, her strokes became shorter, more urgent. On her left, Danni gripped her arm with one hand and John\u0026rsquo;s shoulder with the other has she pressed her sex onto John\u0026rsquo;s vibrating fin. Danni\u0026rsquo;s bright eyes were shinning with love when they rolled suddenly in her head, and a great orgasm tore through her body. Her breasts spurted milk into the water as her entire tail quivered and shook. Phoebe joined her quickly, her breasts spurting milk as she squealed in passion, her tail compressing over Pat\u0026rsquo;s and Danni\u0026rsquo;s onto John\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;I love you,\u0026rdquo; Pat whispered to all three of them. Her pelvis was now slamming only the last two inches of John\u0026rsquo;s cock in and out, pounding with increasing need against his body, pushing her aching clit against the ridges at the top of John\u0026rsquo;s vent. Pat reached both arms around her lover, and ground her sex against his, feeling his massive penis as it rotated deep within her, and then the floodgates opened.\nWith her tail for leverage, she leaned her upper body backwards, pressing her pelvis to his, while her breasts released her milk into the water in great streams, showering all of them in a white cloud that formed around all four of them. Her womb clamped down on John\u0026rsquo;s cock, bringing him to his orgasm, and she could feel the great spurts of cum as they rose from mid-way up his tail, pulsing just below the surface of his scales where their two tails were pressed together, rising up through his long cock, and erupting deep inside her. Her orgasm rippled through her anew with each pulse from John\u0026rsquo;s cock, and both Phoebe and Danni erupted in second orgasms of their own. Again, and again, Pat\u0026rsquo;s torso jerked and trembled as her new \u0026ldquo;mermaid\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; womb clenched in pure ecstasy.\nJust before she fell asleep, with John\u0026rsquo;s slowly softening cock lodged inside her, she happily noted that a mist of white also obscured the other pod from view.\n05 - The Rescue Gail wanted to cut off her hair.\n\u0026ldquo;It will make me faster,\u0026rdquo; she complained. \u0026ldquo;I want to be as fast and as strong as possible.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; pleaded Petra.\n\u0026ldquo;Just do it,\u0026rdquo; Gail asked. \u0026ldquo;Please,\u0026rdquo; as she held out the shears for her sister-wife.\nThey were sitting, mermaid style with their flukes in the water in the Moon Pool cave where the dim light from the stormy sky above filtered down. Michael and John were out searching for useful tools among the reefs, cliffs, and along the drop off where shipwrecks from time immemorial, but mostly from WWII, could be found. The men could swim almost twice as fast and as deep as the women, and they seemed to really enjoy going out together, pushing their new bodies to the limits of endurance and depth. It rankled Gail that her own pod-mate/exsister could go faster, deeper, and longer than she could.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Petra pleaded.\n\u0026ldquo;Why not?\u0026rdquo; demanded Gail.\n\u0026ldquo;Because I love you,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, stroking Gail\u0026rsquo;s cheek.\n\u0026ldquo;You love me,\u0026rdquo; she asked, disbelieving, \u0026ldquo;and THAT is a reason not to cut my hair.\u0026rdquo; At that moment, Pat popped up from the pool, twirling as she rose from the water, smoothly and powerfully rising on her sparkling sea-green tail, and settling next to Gail with a large net of freshly paralyzed fish, mostly tuna.\n\u0026ldquo;When I think about doing it,\u0026rdquo; Petra said holding Gail\u0026rsquo;s beautiful face in her hands, \u0026ldquo;I get a terrible, wrenching feeling in my gut. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why would cutting my hair make you feel that way,\u0026rdquo; asked Gail.\n\u0026ldquo;Because cutting our hair is a bad idea,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Phoebe and I have been doing some tests, and our hair is different from normal human hair,\u0026rdquo; she continued, holding a lock of her own hair towards Gail. \u0026ldquo;Look closely and you can see micronodules that form the sheath of each hair strand. Those same structures are in our skin and scales. These tiny structures force the water to ball up whenever we emerge from the water. You\u0026rsquo;ve noticed how water sluices off us when we get out of the water?\u0026rdquo;\nGail nodded, noting how quickly Pat had dried off, and her hair appeared to be nearly dry even though she had only just emerged from the water.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s one reason why we don\u0026rsquo;t feel dirty,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued. \u0026ldquo;In Biology, it\u0026rsquo;s called the Lotus effect; surface structures force water into little balls, rather than beading or sloughing down our skin, and those balls actually clean our skin and scales each time we dry off because a ball of water picks up dust, dirt, flaking skin cells, etc., whereas a drip of water just slides across the skin, leaving dust, dirt, and even a bit of water on the surface.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that why we swim so fast and so easily?\u0026rdquo; asked Petra.\n\u0026ldquo;Not fast enough,\u0026rdquo; Gail complained.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my dear,\u0026rdquo; Pat chided. \u0026ldquo;Michael and John will always be faster than us; they are bigger by nearly two feet. But you\u0026rsquo;re right, Petra, we are a lot faster than I would expect for aquatic mammals of our size and strength. And, miss grump,\u0026rdquo; she concluded, addressing Gail directly, \u0026ldquo;the length of our hair shields our gills from sunlight while we are swimming.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Our gills can be harmed by sunlight?\u0026rdquo; asked Gail. \u0026ldquo;What about the men? Their hair isn\u0026rsquo;t nearly as long as ours.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Our gills are built slightly differently,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained, turning Petra around so she and Gail could examine her back together. Pat swung her long tail onto the cave floor behind her, easily holding her torso vertical despite the reversed angle. Pat felt her pelvic bones shift, a reminder of her newly reorganized system of bones and muscles. It felt like sitting up, except that her back muscles worked at holding her upper torso upright rather than her abdominal wall. If the results would not be so catastrophic, she would love to dissect someone to see how it all worked. Instead, she gently ran her fingers down Petra\u0026rsquo;s mane of hair, separating the dark, lush brown hair into two strands that she pushed forward over Petra\u0026rsquo;s soft, sloping, shoulders.\n\u0026ldquo;See how the inside edge of each gill is lighter \u0026hellip; pinker \u0026hellip; and that there is a different texture and organization of those tubular gill filaments that run down the entire length,\u0026rdquo; she asked as she ran her fingers lightly down Petra\u0026rsquo;s spine.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, now,\u0026rdquo; Petra giggled. \u0026ldquo;You keep that up and I will throw you down and ravish your body.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Although that might be fun,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, noting how Gail stiffened at Petra\u0026rsquo;s tease, \u0026ldquo;I will wait for my own sister-wives to return from fishing. Now, pay attention. This interior edge is much more sensitive to UV radiation, and I think that it would be very painful if it got too dried out or even worse, sun burnt. It might even kill us; I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. So I don\u0026rsquo;t think we should actually test it, but Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s hair blocks less light than ours, and she gets irritated along that interior ridge if she spends too much time on or near the surface, swimming with her back to the sky.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And the men?\u0026rdquo; Gail asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Their pink filaments are centered near the top of their gills, and their shorter hair covers that dense patch just fine,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;I think because their shoulders are so much broader, they have more room at the top of their gills. Our shoulders are comparatively narrow, and so our pink filaments run the length of our gills.\u0026rdquo;\nGail thought about what Pat had said. The men did have long hair, but it only reached to the top of their dorsal ridge, about mid-way down their backs, leaving the bottom halves of their gills fully exposed. The girls, however, had hair that reached down over the entire length of their gills, two strips of red, tender skin that lifted filaments into the water whenever they were submerged for more than a minute or two. Their gills followed their spines, about three inches wide at the top on the men, and only about an inch wide for the women. Both men and women had darker sections of filaments that followed their spine down, narrowing to a mere sliver at the bottom of their waists where their scales met their skin. A prominent dorsal ridge climbed up from their hips like a reverse widow\u0026rsquo;s peak, terminating in the middle of their backs, a slight ridge that allowed them to lean back onto surfaces without putting direct pressure on their sensitive gills.\n\u0026ldquo;Finally, I would bet that the microstructures in our hair actually add to our speed,\u0026rdquo; Pat argued. \u0026ldquo;It breaks the surface tension of the water molecules as we move through the water, and so cutting it off might make you slower.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But if our skin and hair is hydro, hydro \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Petra struggled.\n\u0026ldquo;Hydrophobic,\u0026rdquo; Pat filled in.\n\u0026ldquo;Hydrophobic,\u0026rdquo; Petra continued with a smile. \u0026ldquo;Why do we float below the surface rather than on top, like Lotus plants?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think it is because our new tails are so dense,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;If you try to lift someone else\u0026rsquo;s tail with your hands, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that they are incredibly heavy, which is why we float tail down. Our upper bodies are much less dense \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And much less strong,\u0026rdquo; Gail interrupted.\n\u0026ldquo;But strong enough,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued gently. \u0026ldquo;Without tests I am unwilling to undertake \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;What tests,\u0026rdquo; Petra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Dissection,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right,\u0026rdquo; Petra said. \u0026ldquo;Good idea not to do one of those.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t tell you more about what goes on inside our new bodies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I keep forgetting that you were a scientist,\u0026rdquo; Petra said.\n\u0026ldquo;AM a scientist! Why do you forget?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked warily.\n\u0026ldquo;Because you\u0026rsquo;re so pretty,\u0026rdquo; Petra giggled.\n\u0026ldquo;Why do we have such different gills?\u0026rdquo; Gail asked, interrupting Petra\u0026rsquo;s flirting.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet, but most species have subtle differences between the male and female species in several body systems,\u0026rdquo; Pat said thoughtfully. \u0026ldquo;Our torsos are smaller, and so our gills are smaller, so perhaps the pink bits are what absorb oxygen while the darker bits are where we slough off carbon dioxide.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We have breasts, too, you know,\u0026rdquo; Petra teased, swinging hers against Gail\u0026rsquo;s other arm.\n\u0026ldquo;YOU have breasts,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;The rest of us just have chests.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just frustrated,\u0026rdquo; Gail grumped, nevertheless enjoying Petra\u0026rsquo;s attention, feeling her enormous breasts rubbing against her elbow fin. \u0026ldquo;I want to free our island of that scum.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said gently. \u0026ldquo;And you are the strongest mermaid here, which is saying something. I\u0026rsquo;m going to find Danni and Phoebe and help them with the fishing. Why don\u0026rsquo;t you two mind the Listening room,\u0026rdquo; she said as she lifted herself up onto her fins and flukes and wiggled to the edge of the pool and slipped head first into the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on,\u0026rdquo; Petra said as she watched Pat\u0026rsquo;s flashing sea-green tail disappear down the tunnel, \u0026ldquo;Michael will be back soon, and then we will start making our plans for the rescue.\u0026rdquo;\nGail gazed into Petra\u0026rsquo;s rich, hazel-green eyes, not a bright green, like Pat\u0026rsquo;s, but softer, flecked with gold. Sometimes her heart felt small and hard, and Gail wished she could feel the emotional and sexual freedom that Michael and Petra seemed to share with each other. When Petra leaned in to kiss her, she could feel herself tense up, pull back. Petra persisted, however, knowing and loving her pod-mate. She opened her lips to the kiss, willing her cool and distant pod-mate to feel the great depth of love she felt for the incredibly beautiful Gail. She opened her eyes in the kiss, gazing at Gail\u0026rsquo;s violet eyes, sparkling in the light of the overcast sky that cascaded down into the moon pool.\nSlowly, Gail softened into Petra\u0026rsquo;s warm and welcoming kiss, nibbling at her full lips as they caressed her own. She felt the familiar tightening across her breasts as she responded to Petra\u0026rsquo;s amorous advances. In between, kisses, she said, \u0026ldquo;We should continue this, in the listening room.\u0026rdquo;\nPetra pulled Gail into a fierce hug, not breaking her kiss, and then pulled them both into the pool with a flick of her tail. Not releasing her hug, Petra slowly propelled them both down the tunnel to the Listening Room, sensing the twists and turns of the underwater tunnel with her mermaid \u0026ldquo;sight,\u0026rdquo; a combination of sensitivity to electrical impulses in all living things, like the organisms living on the rocks along the tunnel walls, and a sonar of sorts that used the reflection of the ambient sounds of their own swimming to form a dim picture of their surroundings in the darkness of the tunnel.\nGail didn\u0026rsquo;t know why Petra could do this to her, but she allowed herself to be swum to the Listening Room. She could feel Petra\u0026rsquo;s enormous breasts pushing against her own as they swam together, their tails crossing and caressing as Petra\u0026rsquo;s long gentle strokes propelled them forward. They rose to the surface of the pitch black \u0026ldquo;Listening Room,\u0026rdquo; and floated in the water with their heads breaking the surface. Petra was still kissing her, even as Gail began to sort out the sounds as they echoed down the various cracks in the earth into this small room. Their enhanced audio processing also allowed them to \u0026ldquo;hear\u0026rdquo; the sounds from many different parts of the island with great clarity. This morning, however, the island was being pelted with a rain, and no useful sounds of Alberto and his men could be heard. In some ways, this was a good thing; no screams from one of the five young captives would likely interrupt what Petra had planned for Gail.\nPetra had become more and more attached to her pod-mates, especially since their dramatic transformations into living and breathing mermaids and mermen. When she gazed at Michael\u0026rsquo;s long, broad tail, his chiseled face, his muscled back, his hair and face glistening with water, or at Gail\u0026rsquo;s sleek lines, her dramatic coloring, her soft curves, or the fire that burned in her eyes, it made Petra\u0026rsquo;s womb ache, but it also made her soul ache. These two had suffered so much, and yet they had focused their new lives on their two pods and on rescuing the captives. They pushed their bodies harder; volunteered long hours of keeping watch, depriving themselves of sleep and rest, and Petra admired them intensely. She knew that Michael had found some healing in his new sex, in her love for him, and in their lovemaking that was free, frantic, and frequent. Gail was more difficult. She could not let go, could not return the affection Petra so very much wanted to give her. She had to find a way.\nAs the two mermaids kissed in the dark pool, both of their tails began to glow, giving off a biochemical luminescence that slowly filled the pitch-black room with a soft light. Gail\u0026rsquo;s tail glowed a rich lavender that shimmered up and down her tail, rippling up from her flukes and flashing along her flanks, while the green highlights along her dorsal ridge and fins also flashed in the dark water. Gail\u0026rsquo;s tail was a barely visible, deep, dark blue ripple of light that only seemed visible in the reflection of Petra\u0026rsquo;s luminescence. The black highlights on her dorsal membrane and fins and flukes flashed the faintest traces of pale, white light as she became more and more aroused. Making love in one of the many dark pools of water within these caves had become something of an adventure for the new water dwellers, thrilling to the symphony of color by which their own bodies produced light under these circumstances.\n\u0026ldquo;Gail, my sister-wife,\u0026rdquo; Petra moaned, \u0026ldquo;you are the most beautiful creature I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen,\u0026rdquo; she said as she sucked on Gail\u0026rsquo;s sensitive, swan-white neck. \u0026ldquo;I want to touch you, love you, caress you forever.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How can you say those things,\u0026rdquo; Gail pleaded, \u0026ldquo;What about Michael?\u0026rdquo; She tried to push away, but Petra wrapped her tail around hers three times, and held her firm to her ample bosom.\n\u0026ldquo;Now listen here, woman,\u0026rdquo; Petra started. \u0026ldquo;Well, not merely a woman any more. You goddess of the water! I love you both! Don\u0026rsquo;t you get it? We are pod-mates.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But I am hard and cold,\u0026rdquo; Gail argued. \u0026ldquo;And you are soft and warm.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which makes us a great pair,\u0026rdquo; Petra said as she kissed Gail\u0026rsquo;s strongfeatured face. \u0026ldquo;Why can\u0026rsquo;t you believe that I love you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because, you are the one who is beautiful, so sexy, so easy with Michael,\u0026rdquo; Gail said with a sob. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m hard, calculating, and cold.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll show you how cold you are,\u0026rdquo; Petra said firmly. \u0026ldquo;Sink.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t, we have to listen,\u0026rdquo; Gail worried.\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a storm,\u0026rdquo; Petra told her, \u0026ldquo;we can\u0026rsquo;t hear anything, and won\u0026rsquo;t be able to for hours. Sink.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; whispered Gail.\n\u0026ldquo;Can,\u0026rdquo; whispered Petra as she nuzzled her pod-mate\u0026rsquo;s neck, and let herself go limp, using her own body weight to pull Gail under the water. They sank about ten meters, and hung in the water, locked in their embrace. They could see each other clearly, both because of their enhanced vision and because of the glow they now gave off.\nPetra released her lover and then slowly began swimming around and around her, caressing Gail\u0026rsquo;s body with her own breasts, her hands, and her tail. She grazed Gail\u0026rsquo;s back, gills, tail, breasts, gliding past lips, eyes, arms, and fins.\n\u0026ldquo;Feel how silky your hair is,\u0026rdquo; she whispered as she gathered Gail\u0026rsquo;s sleek black hair in her hand and held the hair to her own breasts as she twirled around her. \u0026ldquo;Your dorsal membrane is so soft, like Spanish black lace. I can put my arm around your waist and reach my own breast.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s because you have incredible breasts,\u0026rdquo; moaned Gail, feeling the effects of Petra\u0026rsquo;s constant fondling of her entire body.\n\u0026ldquo;Your flukes are supple yet strong, and so rich with color and light,\u0026rdquo; Petra continued as she chased the flashes of light that sparkled from within Gail\u0026rsquo;s now quivering tail, spread wide in evidence of her mounting sexual tension. \u0026ldquo;I love the way your fins soften in my hands, and the way your waist meets your tail, so curvy and soft.\u0026rdquo; Gail gasped with passion as Petra\u0026rsquo;s feather-light touches ignited her body.\nPetra rose before Gail, her own breasts swollen with passion, their impressive size now floating conically, her large nipples stiff and erect in the dim light, her dorsal membrane fluttering and flickering madly with soft, green and lavender light. Her own flukes were also fully spread, quivering in the dark water, shooting tendrils of lavender light up her flanks as she hung in the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Drink from me, my love,\u0026rdquo; Petra asked, as she fluttered her tail to lift her swelling breast to Gail\u0026rsquo;s lips. \u0026ldquo;Take comfort from me, take from me \u0026hellip; peace.\u0026rdquo;\nPetra pulled Gail\u0026rsquo;s lips to her breast, and then stroked Gail\u0026rsquo;s beautiful black hair as she began to suckle. Gail slowly, gently wrapped her tail around her lover\u0026rsquo;s, resting her hands on Petra\u0026rsquo;s slim waist, stroking the line that separated her tail from her waist. Petra focused her thoughts on love, peace, and comfort as Gail\u0026rsquo;s suckling slowly built passion and effort. Soon, milk was pouring from her breasts, and Gail was pulling and sucking with passion on Petra\u0026rsquo;s impressive bounty. As she drank from Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts, Gail\u0026rsquo;s tail increased its luminescence, the flashes of light building in frequency and intensity. Her own breasts swelled with passion, and her mind began to relax.\nPetra sank back down into a kiss, pressing her breasts against Gail\u0026rsquo;s, kissing her with passion and hunger. She wrapped her tail around hers again, and used that advantage to press her genital vent against Gail\u0026rsquo;s, creating a pocket of suction. Her pelvic fins beat against Gail\u0026rsquo;s, increasing the vibrations of their union, and further elevating Gail\u0026rsquo;s building passion.\n\u0026ldquo;Give yourself to me,\u0026rdquo; Petra whispered. \u0026ldquo;Cum for me.\u0026rdquo;\nGail reached behind her sister-wife and grabbed the generous bones of her pelvis, her wide hipbones that now bent in both directions. She pulled Petra to her fiercely, further entwining their tails together, pressing their bodies together. Petra happily purred, grinding her hips against Gail\u0026rsquo;s, pressing their breasts together, kissing her neck and ears, cheeks and chin.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Petra,\u0026rdquo; Gail groaned, \u0026ldquo;my sister-wife.\u0026rdquo;\nTheir bodies were now twisting quickly in the darkened pool, locked in a passionate embrace, their hips grinding together as their breasts and lips danced in the cool, dark water, their tails both pulsing with electricity. Petra began whimpering, \u0026ldquo;please, please \u0026hellip; please \u0026hellip; oh \u0026hellip; please\u0026rdquo; as her own orgasm built, but she refused to give in, focusing her energy on bringing release and pleasure to her partner. She reached behind her sister-mate and stroked Gail\u0026rsquo;s gills lightly with her fingers. Gail\u0026rsquo;s body responded, immediately, involuntarily, responsively to Petra\u0026rsquo;s stimulation, and her abdomen began to pulse against the voluptuous Petra.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; my \u0026hellip; goooooooooooo\u0026rdquo; Gail dissolved into incoherence as a massive orgasm overtook her. Her eyes rolled back in her head as she bit down into Petra\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. She felt her tail quiver and shake more violently, her clitoris vibrating against her lover\u0026rsquo;s, their bodies pressed together.\nPetra felt a sharp, sweet pain as Gail\u0026rsquo;s eye teeth sank into her shoulder, but felt at the same moment her own milk flowing through her veins, nurturing them both, healing her of Gail\u0026rsquo;s love bite.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, take me \u0026hellip; bite me \u0026hellip; love me,\u0026rdquo; Petra whispered to her convulsing lover. \u0026ldquo;My love can heal your pain.\u0026rdquo; Gail lifted from Petra\u0026rsquo;s shoulder, her eyes sightless and unconscious of how her own pent up passion had exploded into her lover\u0026rsquo;s flesh leaving four neat puncture wounds that closed as quickly as her teeth had released their grip. Gail merely continued to shake into her lover, pulsing with abandon, rather than control.\nAs she watched Gail thrash out her first real orgasm, Petra allowed her own release to come, joining with her as both their breasts spurted their milk into the water around them. Soon they were both lost in a haze of pleasure, release, healing, and white milk.\nMai Lin wanted to die.\nShe had been captive now for many months, and she had lost track of time. She no longer cared when Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men came into her hut and took their pleasure; her body no longer felt any pleasure at all. Sometimes, she felt more dead than alive. In fact, if it hadn\u0026rsquo;t been for Martin, one of the Henderson triplets, she might have died three weeks ago. Dear, sweet Martin \u0026hellip; only 17, but so wise. He had simply held her hand through the night as she miscarried, the sorry result of her near constant abuse by Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men, never saying anything, giving her warmth and support, and helping her staunch the bleeding. She knew that he was being raped too, but he never complained, never flinched. She could see the quiet courage behind his eyes, and something else too. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure. Neither his sisters nor Shou Ling, the other Chinese captive, had been able to help her that night, lost as they were to their own hellish nightmares that stalked all of their dreams. She vowed she would not forget Martin\u0026rsquo;s kindness and quiet courage.\nShe had been captured, along with several other Chinese passengers including Shou Ling, when she went on a pleasure cruise with friends from her boarding school in Hong Kong. The other girls had died months ago; the three crewmembers of the charter boat were killed when Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men boarded their boat. Somehow, both she and Shou Ling had survived. They were both Han Chinese, from northern China, and were relatively tall for Chinese women, about 5' 7'' and pretty. Shou Ling seemed to have a bit less of a wild streak in her because she seemed aloof to what her captors were doing, whereas Mai Lin fought it every step of the way, trying to force this nightmare to end. After they had beaten her or raped her yet again, she would close her eyes, and wait for death to come, but instead a new morning greeted her yet again. Which was just fine with her; she would have yet another opportunity for revenge.\nMai Lin had been a young master in shaolin kungfu, which was probably the only reason she was still alive. She could deflect the blows that might have killed her without seeming to, and her captors seemed to enjoy beating the beautiful young woman. She kept her secrets to herself, and bided her time, waiting for Alberto to do something foolish so she could kill him. After she had blinded one man who was foolish enough to rape her by himself, without someone else to hold her down, they had nearly killed her. But she was beautiful, and Alberto forbade them from killing her, though she did get a pretty severe beating. Mai Lin had learned to walk the thin line between compliance and resistance, looking for her opportunities for revenge, but keeping her captors happy.\nShe looked across the sand in the early morning light, the sky still a vibrant blue as the sun had yet to peak over the horizon of calm water and placid palm trees, and look back inside the hut to took stock of her fellow captives. The Henderson\u0026rsquo;s were all curled in a corner, a tangle of limbs as much for protection as for warmth, the triplets now united in a race for survival. Shou Ling was propped against the wall, beaten and bruised because she would not respond last night to the men\u0026rsquo;s request that she dance. Mai Lin admired her courage, even if it was misplaced-it would have been so easy to give them a little dance-and wondered how a girl so beautiful, more beautiful than she herself was, could have so much stubborn fire in her soul. She wished she could have taken Shou Ling\u0026rsquo;s beating, she could have withstood it more easily, and looking across at her fellow countrywoman, she feared that Shou Ling would not survive many more such beatings.\nShe glanced again at the three sleeping Henderson\u0026rsquo;s, feeling a great wave of affection wash over her. They had been so scared when they were first added to Alberto\u0026rsquo;s menagerie of captives, but even in their fear they had reached out to Mai Lin, who spoke only broken English at best. In order to keep their spirits up, the Henderson\u0026rsquo;s had taken to helping Mai Lin with her English, Shou Ling didn\u0026rsquo;t need much help, as her English was fine. But after Rikki and Cleo, the identical twin sisters, were gang raped one night by the all of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men, they both had stopped talking to anyone and now seemed to be walking through life as in a trance. Martin still showed signs of life and fight, but there were deeper waters in his eyes than she could figure out. Only a few of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men had an interest in his body, and the two women seemed to be lovers themselves. Everyone, however, even the two women gang members, loved the Henderson girls; Mai Lin worried that the twins would soon simply expire and that Alberto would kill Shou Ling because she was so stubborn. That would leave only her and the boy, Martin, to satisfy the selfish desires of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men. She shuddered at the thought.\nA flash of blue caught her eye in the lagoon as she turned back to the water, trying to will herself erect so that she could make another attempt at escape. She thought she could see a tail fin of a large fish, nearly ten feet in length, as the flukes, over three feet across, arched back into the sea. She brought a shaky hand back up to her eyes to rub them, disbelieving what she had seen, and tried to stare out into the early morning light to catch another glimpse of that beautiful fish, blue scales with the hint of white along the dorsal ridge. Suddenly she saw a flash of gold tinged in a multi-hued blue crest the surface not three meters where she had seen the first fish tail break the smooth surface of the water. The beautiful flukes flashed in the pale light of the morning sun that had finally crested over the horizon to her left.\nThen she thought she saw a face \u0026hellip; a human face \u0026hellip; a beautiful girl, lift her head from the water closer to shore. She had blonde hair that was nearly white, and beautiful blue eyes. She was only about twenty meters from shore, in about two meters of water. Then, a second face emerged, also a blonde female, with golden hair but equally blue eyes, or so it seemed to Mai Lin. The pair of beautiful women stared at the camp for a minute or two, Mai Lin barely breathing, not daring to raise the alarm. Suddenly, one of the beautiful girls caught Mai Lin\u0026rsquo;s eyes, and smiled, and put a finger to her lips for silence. Mai Lin\u0026rsquo;s widened in surprise \u0026hellip; she had been seen, and these girls knew she was a captive!\nSuddenly there was a shout from another hut, and the two girls ducked under the water and disappeared. Mai Lin stared hard at the spot where they had appeared, but she could see no other sign of them. She searched the water for any sign of swimmers or of the large fish she had seen earlier, but she could only see the calm, early morning waters of the lagoon where they had been held captive for so many weeks.\nA few seconds later, a group of five or six men had gathered at the beach, all searching the water, shouting at one another in a mixture of Pilipino, Spanish, and English. Mai Lin could make out some of their English, and they seemed to be shouting about a sea monster. Alberto himself came down to the beach and demanded which of them had seen the sea monster. One of the men stepped forward and described a great fish of gold with terrible teeth, and Alberto shot him. He then pointed his gun at the others and reminded them that they were on the lookout for people, for the police, not sea monsters.\nA glance back to the hut confirmed that the gunshot had woken up his captives. He decided that it was time for some morning fun.\n\u0026ldquo;All five are still alive,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported, \u0026ldquo;and we waited until we were seen before we ducked under the water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think one of the Chinese girls may have seen us,\u0026rdquo; Danni said. \u0026ldquo;I mean she really \u0026ldquo;saw us;\u0026rdquo; she looked really shocked when I smiled at her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that she saw your tail,\u0026rdquo; Gail said. \u0026ldquo;If I had seen anyone who was not connected to my captors who actually \u0026ldquo;saw me,\u0026rdquo; I would have been surprised too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I guess you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Danni agreed. \u0026ldquo;In any case, if we are successful with our rescue, it won\u0026rsquo;t matter. They will know who we are.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There will be another storm tonight; are we ready?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat, looking around the Moon Pool at the collected pods. Everyone nodded in agreement.\n\u0026ldquo;One more time,\u0026rdquo; Gail said. \u0026ldquo;I hate to be a hard ass but it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; because you love us,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, reaching out to her sister-wife and stroking her arm fins.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Gail said, softly, \u0026ldquo;it is.\u0026rdquo;\nEveryone had noticed the change in Gail over the last two weeks as their plans for mounting a rescue came together. She seemed more connected, more balanced, and less angry. She and Petra had spent much more time together, and Michael had now been forced to step up his amatory efforts (he was most eager and willing to do so). Petra had always been randy and ready, demanding attention from Michael several times a day, but Gail had only allowed herself to be taken by him occasionally. In the last two weeks, however, she had made love to him every day, and, in the last few days, joined Petra for a second or even a third round of sex. She still had the fierce gleam in her eyes, and no one doubted her dedication to pay back with double interest the suffering she had endured at Alberto\u0026rsquo;s hands.\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Michael said watching with grateful pride and love as his wives softly stroked one another. \u0026ldquo;John and I will take the old mines we found and release them under the boats. If either one still works, that will signal the rest of you to begin.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure you will have enough time to get clear?\u0026rdquo; asked Petra for the hundredth time.\n\u0026ldquo;The mines are counter weighted, and it will take them at least a minute to travel the fifteen meters up from the bottom to hit the boats,\u0026rdquo; Pat reassured her, yet again. \u0026ldquo;They can swim faster than any of us, and should be clear by at least double the distance needed. Do you think I\u0026rsquo;d let John do anything that crazy?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And everyone remember to protect your ears,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe added.\n\u0026ldquo;If the mines don\u0026rsquo;t go off,\u0026rdquo; John continued. \u0026ldquo;We will climb on board and sabotage the engines, and then use the bow gun on the larger boat to sink both boats.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because the mines will work,\u0026rdquo; Danni said with a smile and a caress for her pod-mate, \u0026ldquo;John and Michael will rush over to us when the blast goes off. Petra and I will start shouting for help from the west side of the lagoon, making sure our human half is clearly visible, while the boys lurk below to make sure no trouble gets too close.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As soon as enough men are drawn to the beach, trying to save their boats or these two bathing beauties, we three will make for the prisoner\u0026rsquo;s hut from our hiding place on the east side of the lagoon,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported. \u0026ldquo;Gail in the lead, then me, then Pat.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll take out the guard, if he remains, and then use my coloring to hide and wait for anyone who may head in our direction,\u0026rdquo; Gail said firmly.\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe and I will enter the hut, rouse the prisoners, use our canteens that are full, thanks to Petra, give them a stiff dose of milk, and lead them to one of the two inflatable dinghies on the beach,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;We will use our barbs to puncture one, and load the prisoners onto the other. Once the boat clears the beach, we will swim with the boat towards the open sea.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;John, Michael, Petra, and Danni will continue to provide a distraction, while I join the girls behind the dingy,\u0026rdquo; Gail said. \u0026ldquo;Once we clear the lagoon, everyone will help get the dinghy back the western cliffs as quickly as possible.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then, we will take them into the water, and rush them through the tunnels back here,\u0026rdquo; Pat finished, \u0026ldquo;forming a fireman\u0026rsquo;s brigade to help them breath by giving them our air until they reach the Moon Pool Cave.\u0026rdquo;\nThey all looked again at each other, nodded and headed down the tunnel to the open sea.\nIt was a very loud explosion.\nMartin struggled towards consciousness, the lethargy that gripped his body would not release him, and he struggled against the nightmare that held him. He heard someone calling his name, and he opened his eyes. There was a beautiful woman urging him to wake up, to rise. Her red hair was curled around her neck and shoulders like a velvet scarf, her green eyes shone even in the dark, storm tossed hut, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t look wet. How could that be; it was raining. She was naked, too.\nThat got his attention, and weakened as he was, he struggled to sit up.\n\u0026ldquo;Here, drink this,\u0026rdquo; the vision of beauty ordered. He did so, and was immediately rewarded with a feeling of warmth and vitality that coursed through his throat like a fine whiskey, burning slightly but warming him. He could see another figure in the hut, moving very strangely, who\u0026rsquo;s hair seemed nearly white. Then he saw the sparkling sea-blue of her tail \u0026hellip; her long tail \u0026hellip; her mermaid\u0026rsquo;s tail that looked just like the pictures from his long missing diary.\n\u0026ldquo;Whu, wha, what is \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; he sputtered.\n\u0026ldquo;No time for questions now,\u0026rdquo; the redhead whispered tensely, \u0026ldquo;follow us down to the dinghy. We are trying to rescue you.\u0026rdquo;\nHe struggled to his feet and looked for his sisters. He saw that they were already outside, waiting for him. Shou Ling was helping Mai Lin stumble through the rain, running for the beach. He tried to ignore the strange gait of his rescuers as they slithered over the sand, but they moved much more quickly than he did. He became aware that the boats in the lagoon were burning, and that a group of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men were running along the western arm of the lagoon shouting. He nearly tripped over a gang member who was inert on the sand, a neat red hole in the middle of his stomach.\nThe white haired mermaid (mermaid!) was falling back, trying to urge him to go faster. He tried to get his feet to obey his commands, but it was like he was still in the dream. Everything seemed to go in slow motion. Finally, the dinghy appeared before him, and he tumbled into the small boat, laying against his sisters who were also heaving with the effort of the short dash for freedom. The boat lurched towards the sea, and then slowly gathered speed as it headed for the middle of the lagoon.\nGunshots rang out, and Martin chanced a look over the edge of the inflatable dinghy. Illuminated by the light of the burning boats which he was now passing on his right, he could see some men scrambling on the beach, firing shots at their boat. Bullets zipped into the water and one pinged off the outboard engine, but none hit the vulnerable craft. The boat seemed to be picking up speed, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t hear an engine running nor could he feel the vibrations of one. Finally, the lights of the burning boats and the shouts along the shore faded as he slipped back into the darkness from which he had been roused.\nThe two mines had both gone off, and at nearly the same time.\nPerfect.\nGail had waited until she saw at least ten men head towards the western arm of the lagoon, responding to Petra\u0026rsquo;s and Danni\u0026rsquo;s plaintive cries for help. Then she charged up the beach, low to the ground, a black angel of vengeance. The surprised guard never saw or heard her coming, and when her barb sank into his abdomen, pumping him full of her venom, Gail imagined that is how a man felt, planting his seed into a woman. The guard fell noiselessly to the sand, and Pat and Phoebe joined her at the hut. She kept watch while the others woke, fed, and roused the five captives.\nThen they all made a mad dash for the beach. It all seemed too easy, until the gunshots rang out. A white hot flash of pain seared her shoulder and another pierced her side, and then the pain faded. Interesting, she thought to her self, getting shot ought to hurt more, and she looked at the ragged tear in her shoulder with fascination, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t stop pushing the boat. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until nearly an hour later, when Petra pried her fingers off the stern, that she realized how weak she felt, how tired she was.\nHer last thought was how beautiful Petra was, even when she was crying.\nDanni was alone in the water, her golden hair illuminated by the fire of the burning boats.\nShe wasn\u0026rsquo;t afraid; John was circling below her. She could feel his electrical pattern though her fringes and along her dorsal ridge. Petra had headed back for the caves as soon as the men headed for the girls, pretending to have drowned, a last minute improvisation that she hoped would lend more urgency to Danni\u0026rsquo;s cries even as it gave her more time to prepare for everyone\u0026rsquo;s return, and it gave Michael permission to swim for Gail, now that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t needed to protect her. Petra had at once thanked whatever forces in the universe that had given them Michael and had provided him with an unerring sense of what she and Gail were thinking.\nThat left Danni alone with John below, and she sang her siren\u0026rsquo;s song. But she was surprised by the speed of the young man who was charging towards her, determined to rescue her. He was already up to his waist, while most of the men were still a hundred yards down the beach. She could see with her enhanced eyes the dim shapes of Gail, Pat, and Phoebe as they emerged from the other shore. She needed to give them more time, so she tried to keep the determined young man a few yards away while still not giving herself (or her tail) away.\nHe was a better swimmer than she thought.\nAs Alberto\u0026rsquo;s man closed on Danni, John shot to the surface. He gathered the intruder into his arms just as the criminal\u0026rsquo;s hand had closed on a fistful of Danni\u0026rsquo;s hair. His powerful tail carried both of them into the air, and Danni gave a cry of pain as a few strands of her thick and full hair came away in the desperado\u0026rsquo;s grasp. John kept his captive in front of his upper torso, letting his steel-gray flanks shine in the light from the burning boats, but keeping his human half behind the struggling and screaming man.\nJohn switched his grip as they came back down into the water, but as they plunged below the surface, he discovered that the man was limp, literally dead weight in his arms-his neck was broken. John hadn\u0026rsquo;t intended to kill him, but nearly 300 pounds of angry merman rushing up from twenty meters below at full force was as good as a head butt from a killer whale. John had simply let the poor man float back to the surface as he circled back beneath between the men and Danni. There were now six men in the water with knives flashing, more determined than ever to rescue (or capture) the beautiful woman struggling in the water.\nMoments passed as Danni slowly retreated further into the lagoon, while more men poured into the water, heeding her cries for help.\nJohn had a sudden inspiration and extended his dorsal fin to its maximum height; he surfaced his back in the water between the men and Danni, and twisting his flukes vertically-like a shark\u0026rsquo;s tailfins-and swam with only his dorsal fin, and twisted tailfin visible-towards Danni. Danni, to her great credit, immediately started screaming \u0026ldquo;Shark, shark,\u0026rdquo; as the rest of the men paused in fear, wondering why the large grey shark that had just struck at their own man was now headed for the still struggling woman. There must be more than one shark! The other one would be feeding on their poor comrade. As John\u0026rsquo;s dorsal fin slipped below the surface, Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men hung back in fear, unable to move towards Danni and unwilling to retreat from such a beautiful woman. Suddenly, in mid-scream, Danni was pulled violently below. As the men dived beneath the waves to find her, they found their comrade instead, floating towards the surface dead, but otherwise unmolested.\nThat was no shark.\nThey could see one of their two dinghy\u0026rsquo;s floating further out in the lagoon, but no one made a move to go get it. It looked empty, and the water had not been a safe place to be at night.\nAs soon as they were far enough away, John twisted the \u0026ldquo;limp\u0026rdquo; Danni in his arms, gave her an enormous kiss, and kept swimming with his full force. Danni hung on to his hips and drafted on his strong strokes, and together they caught up to the boat.\nWith John and Michael on the bowlines, and the five women at the stern, the boat moved fast enough that Martin could have water skied back to the cliffs, if he hadn\u0026rsquo;t already been passed out in the bottom of the boat.\nWhen he reached the hut, he knew what had happened.\nThose bitches.\nAlberto cursed the gods who were causing such strange events to befall his now shrinking gang of pirates, thieves, and cutthroats. As he watched the latest victim of these strange circumstances float towards shore behind his quickly retreating men, he knew which of his captives had been part of the escape. It was that bitch Mai Lin; she was a feisty one, and he should have killed her long ago, but she was so pretty he couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring himself to do it, that and the few times he thought he had hit her hard enough, the bitch survived. Now this. She had made contact with those women, they had helped her, and the others, escape.\nDamn, this island had proved dangerous. From his original twenty-two men, two women and five captives, he was down to fourteen men, two women, and no captives. He wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be shooting anyone else to help maintain discipline; he didn\u0026rsquo;t know how many others were out there. There had been a blonde woman in the water, and now he regretted shooting Hui that morning; that was not a sea monster out there-it was a human. Everyone had seen the woman, perhaps even two, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter if that shark got her or not. They were here, on the island, and he and his men had missed them when they were searching for bobby traps. He had to find them. Those caves to the east were a good place to start.\nThe fleeing dinghy was now gone from his view, having disappeared past the opening of the lagoon. His two magnificent yachts were now at the bottom of the lagoon, only the radio mast from his flagship poked above the surface. That was bad, without those boats, he was stuck here, but he wasn\u0026rsquo;t down for the count. He would find where Mai Lin and the other captives were hiding, and he would make them pay. First, however, he needed to find out which of his remaining men had left the keys to the outboard motor on the dinghy, which had allowed their captives to make an escape. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t too worried, he had another dinghy, and there was only enough gas for an hour\u0026rsquo;s run time in the boat they stole. They wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get far. The one on the beach had a full tank, enough for several hours of searching. He would find them before morning. He started towards the remaining dinghy.\nIt was then he noticed that it was losing air as it collapsed slowly onto the sand, several holes ripped into the hull.\nShit.\nHe hated this island, he hated that bitch, and he hated this storm.\n\u0026ldquo;How is she?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked carefully.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s alive,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered, stroking Petra\u0026rsquo;s hair as the sobbing mermaid held Gail\u0026rsquo;s lips firmly to her breast. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s lost a lot of blood. I can\u0026rsquo;t believe she pushed the boat the whole way back.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I didn\u0026rsquo;t see her wounds,\u0026rdquo; Petra sobbed.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t blame yourself,\u0026rdquo; chided Pat. \u0026ldquo;You know how she is.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s my pod-mate,\u0026rdquo; Petra said angrily. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s my mate.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s our mate,\u0026rdquo; Michael said softly as he rose from the pool, his hand fixing Gail\u0026rsquo;s hair, as she lay unconscious beneath Petra\u0026rsquo;s impressive breast. Gail\u0026rsquo;s lips weren\u0026rsquo;t moving, but she was breathing, and her gills were in the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Michael,\u0026rdquo; Petra sobbed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; I meant.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I know,\u0026rdquo; he said softly as he pushed his long body out of the water next to Petra and wrapped his arms around her. He did know what she meant. It was as if Petra had given Gail some of her warmth and sensuality and Gail had given Petra some of her fierce anger. He held his flukes to support Gail\u0026rsquo;s lower tail, hoping that their unconscious mate would feel the love and energy they both were sending to her.\nAs soon as they discovered her wounds, they had all fed Gail as much milk as they could before she lost consciousness, and then bathed her two wounds in their milk as well, but Gail had lost a lot of blood. Pat had suggested that they keep her gills in the water and her head in the air to maximize the amount of energy her body could draw upon. As far as she could tell, the bullets had passed cleanly through Gail\u0026rsquo;s shoulder and left hip, but given how little she really knew about their new anatomy, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sure the hip wound wasn\u0026rsquo;t more serious. In any event, only time would heal Gail, if she could be healed.\nShe looked around the cave, feeling the soft spray of rain filter down from the chimney above. The storm still lashed at the island, but they had succeeded. Save for Gail\u0026rsquo;s injuries, everyone else had made it back without a scratch.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go back and reconnoiter,\u0026rdquo; Pat said to John. \u0026ldquo;You two stay here and help Petra and crew, and if our guests awake, you can begin to explain what\u0026rsquo;s happened to them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They don\u0026rsquo;t have a choice, do they?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;No, not really,\u0026rdquo; sighed Pat. \u0026ldquo;They drank our milk, and so their journey is inevitable.\u0026rdquo;\nPat leaned over and kissed Petra\u0026rsquo;s forehead and ruffled Michael\u0026rsquo;s hair. She turned to her mate. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go and see how Alberto likes being stuck on an island in a storm,\u0026rdquo; she said, and together they slipped into the water.\nPhoebe waddled over to Petra and gave her a kiss too. She then bent down and kissed Gail\u0026rsquo;s cheek. \u0026ldquo;You did good, girl,\u0026rdquo; she whispered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so proud of you. You too, my sister-uncle,\u0026rdquo; she said running her finger along Petra\u0026rsquo;s cheek, wiping a tear she found there.\n\u0026ldquo;Why are you proud of me?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;To many reasons to tell,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;Danni, let\u0026rsquo;s go see if our guests could use some milk, eh?\u0026rdquo;\nAs the other two girls busied themselves with the still unconscious guests on the far side of the cave, Michael held tight to his two women, closed his eyes, and willed them to be well. Alberto had had many chances to take Gail from him in the past, and he refused to believe that he could take her from him now. They had come so far, and changed so much. The thought of losing his beautiful Gail, his womanwarrior, the perfect balance to Petra\u0026rsquo;s lush womanhood, was more than he thought he could bear.\n\u0026ldquo;We will get him,\u0026rdquo; Petra whispered into his ear, her voice ragged with emotion. \u0026ldquo;I will hold him down myself as you and Gail skewer him again, and again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I love you,\u0026rdquo; he replied, holding her face to his chest.\nThe three of them remained like that until morning, when Pat and John returned.\nThe Moon Pool cave floor was crowded.\nMerfolk took up much more room than regular humans, and six of them were spread out on the narrow cave floor that surrounded the Moon Pool. Nestled among them were the five new guests, as they were being called. None had woken during the night; the healing effects of the first draughts of mermaid milk had caused them to swoon just like Daniel (now Danni), Peter (now Petra), Michelle (now Michael), Gail, and Phoebe had before them.\nAt first, Martin had thought he had woken up from an incredible dream, half nightmare, half mythological wonder. But when the sunlight slowly filtered down from the chimney, and he saw the beautiful Pieta-like tableau of Michael, Petra, and Gail, he pinched himself to make sure he wasn\u0026rsquo;t still dreaming. When a near copy of the mermaid pictured in his diary rose from the pool, he nearly fainted.\nIt was now late morning, and everyone had learned the story of Pat and John, then Danni, and then the rest. Gail had regained consciousness, and her wounds seemed to have healed, but she was too weak to leave the water. She propped her chin on her hands, while the rest of her floated in the pool behind her.\n\u0026ldquo;We become you?\u0026rdquo; Shou Ling asked again, looking furtively at Michael, Petra and Gail.\n\u0026ldquo;Not necessarily,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;We had to do this to ourselves on purpose. You could end up looking quite differently.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; asked Martin.\n\u0026ldquo;Because we didn\u0026rsquo;t know what we might otherwise change into,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;We were growing webbing and had already grown our gills, and the changes weren\u0026rsquo;t stopping.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you were trapped in this cave, constantly exposed to water,\u0026rdquo; Rikki finished. \u0026ldquo;You had to take control of what was happening to you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Unfortunately, in order to rescue you, we had to put you on the same path,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;We WILL become you,\u0026rdquo; Shou Ling said with happy recognition.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry,\u0026rdquo; Pat apologized. \u0026ldquo;You WANT to become us?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Shou Ling said. \u0026ldquo;We all die, bit-by-bit, for long time. Now, need new life. You beautiful, different life. I want that life, not my old life. You life, not by trouble, but by choice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do all of you understand what she\u0026rsquo;s suggesting,\u0026rdquo; asked Pat, as she turned to each of them. Ricki, Cleo, Martin, Shou Ling, and all voiced their intent to join them, and then Mai Lin gave a barely perceptible nod. \u0026ldquo;Well, in that case, there are some logistics we need to work out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Like what?\u0026rdquo; Shou Ling asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe and I have been going over my notes on the original harems of the painted shell-fish from which the goop was first distilled,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;We have a few hypotheses based on the fishes' behavior and our own, at least among our two pods.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s have it,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, as he held Petra in one arm as his other hand trailed into the water to caress Gail\u0026rsquo;s shoulders.\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe,\u0026rdquo; Pat prompted.\n\u0026ldquo;Three to one seems to be our optimum ratio,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe explained as she gave winks to her three pod mates. \u0026ldquo;The painted shell fish have harems in a ratio of males to estrus cycles of 36:1, which is to say that there is one male for each 36 possible pregnancies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But I thought they lived in harems of 20 to 1,\u0026rdquo; John interrupted.\n\u0026ldquo;Those fish aren\u0026rsquo;t in estrus every month,\u0026rdquo; she continued. \u0026ldquo;They go into estrus twice a year. We, on the other hand, have periods every month, like normal humans. Thus, the same ratio would be three females to every one male.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Physiologically and psychologically,\u0026rdquo; Pat added, \u0026ldquo;there seems to be some advantages to the three to one ratio. Sexually, three females can be kept quite content and connected through one male, whereas four females makes pairing a problem. Two to one makes it necessary for both females to travel with the male, as there is no second female to nest with.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We nest?\u0026rdquo; asked Gail from the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;More or less,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued. \u0026ldquo;Think about what happened to Petra when you and Michael were doing all your patrols. She was crazy with worry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I was nuts,\u0026rdquo; Petra smiled, stroking Gail\u0026rsquo;s hair.\n\u0026ldquo;You weren\u0026rsquo;t nuts,\u0026rdquo; Pat corrected. \u0026ldquo;You had no one to fill the strong pair bond instincts we have. It is sort of like schools of fish, if you like. Our social needs seem to be quite high, and two merfolk at all times-two women or one of each seem to be the minimum necessary.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The men can pair together without conflict if they are alone,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe explained, \u0026ldquo;or if they are with one of their pod mates, all is well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But if it\u0026rsquo;s just Michael and I,\u0026rdquo; John interrupted, \u0026ldquo;and one other woman, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter whose pod-mate she is \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;We can barely control ourselves,\u0026rdquo; Michael finished, \u0026ldquo;even though we really like each other. It does seem to be hard wired into us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which brings us back to the logistical problem,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;There are five of you, three of whom are blood related. If Martin assumes podleadership, we take a double jeopardy chance on the off-spring from both sisters, or we separate one sister away, which \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t going to happen,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said softy. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re triplets \u0026hellip; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t abandon my brother and sister.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But could you mate with your brother?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Ewwwee\u0026rdquo; Cleo responded. \u0026ldquo;No offense, Martin.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;None taken,\u0026rdquo; he said calmly.\n\u0026ldquo;What about us?\u0026rdquo; Gail asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, \u0026ldquo;but your pod won\u0026rsquo;t have three blood related pairs, and so even if you and Michael prove infertile, Petra and any new pod-mates would be fine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah,\u0026rdquo; Gail mused, \u0026ldquo;besides, Petra will probably have a million kids given the way she mothers us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Martin, you haven\u0026rsquo;t told them yet, have you,\u0026rdquo; Rikki asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\nAfter a moment of awkward silence, Petra suddenly realized, \u0026ldquo;It was your diary, wasn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo; Everyone turned to her with a look of surprise. \u0026ldquo;Well, it takes one to recognize one. I mean, we all just assumed it was Cleo\u0026rsquo;s or Rikki\u0026rsquo;s.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have my diary?\u0026rdquo; Martin choked out?\nPhoebe reached behind her and pulled a plastic wrapped book from a crag in one of the rocks. She handed it to Martin. As he pulled the book from its protective covering, he gasped in surprise and delight.\n\u0026ldquo;They found it,\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;How did you find it?\n\u0026ldquo;It was on your parent\u0026rsquo;s boat, which washed ashore a few weeks before you all showed up,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;We gave the unrecognizable bodies on the deck a burial at sea, and then set booby traps in the boat for Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are all so sorry,\u0026rdquo; Petra said.\nThere was a long moment of silence as the three Henderson children fought to control their emotions.\n\u0026ldquo;We \u0026hellip; we \u0026hellip; will mourn later \u0026hellip; when Alberto is dead,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said firmly.\n\u0026ldquo;Where \u0026hellip; how \u0026hellip; how did you know it was my diary?\u0026rdquo; Martin asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I was a life-long cross-dresser before I changed into this lovely form,\u0026rdquo; Petra said. \u0026ldquo;I actually wanted to become a woman, not like Pat and Danni who become women accidentally.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And I wanted to become a man,\u0026rdquo; Michael added, stroking Petra\u0026rsquo;s hair, \u0026ldquo;because my life as a woman had left me unsatisfied. We\u0026rsquo;re both happier now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are ALL happier, now,\u0026rdquo; Gail said.\n\u0026ldquo;So, it is your diary?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s mine. I wrote it, and now you transformed yourself into the creature of my dreams. My sisters have always known that I wanted to be their sister, not their brother. Ever since I can remember, I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to be a sister to my sisters.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And, you wanted to be a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Cleo teased. \u0026ldquo;Always making us swim like dolphins as we were growing up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And, always stealing our clothes from our closets,\u0026rdquo; Rikki teased. \u0026ldquo;At least now, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about clothes here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who become man then?\u0026rdquo; asked Shou Ling.\n\u0026ldquo;I do,\u0026rdquo; Mai Lin said firmly.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; asked Shou Ling, \u0026ldquo;What happen to me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You become our pod-mate,\u0026rdquo; Petra said firmly, but gently. \u0026ldquo;I have more than enough love for all of you,\u0026rdquo; she argued as she lifted one of her large breasts towards Shou Ling, who blushed.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that solves the logistics problem, we have genetic diversity among the pods,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with surprise. \u0026ldquo;But I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect so neat a solution,\u0026rdquo; Pat mused. \u0026ldquo;Is everyone sure of what we are about to do?\u0026rdquo; She checked everyone\u0026rsquo;s faces for agreement. She saw the same sparkle in their eyes now as she saw in Gail\u0026rsquo;s eyes first time they had beheld Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s beauty after her transformation. \u0026ldquo;The question now is, how will we do it. One or two stages?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;One,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Why only one?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;ve only had two servings of milk,\u0026rdquo; she responded, \u0026ldquo;but they are already starting to change, subtle changes so far, except for one big one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What big one is that?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked noting that she couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any major differences in their guests other than that were all healthy and conscious.\n\u0026ldquo;Their gills have already appeared,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, \u0026ldquo;way ahead of schedule.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god,\u0026rdquo; Cleo exclaimed, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got red marks on your backs just like them,\u0026rdquo; she said while pointing at her brother\u0026rsquo;s exposed back.\nAll the guests checked their backs, and indeed, they had gills from only two feedings of mermaid milk.\n\u0026ldquo;The active agents in our milk is getting stronger and stronger,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe concluded. \u0026ldquo;I think that if we all go to the pool, and combine our fluids, energy, and focus, they can all make it through in one stage. Otherwise \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;They-and we-might not be able to \u0026ldquo;control\u0026rdquo; their changes. You\u0026rsquo;re right Phoebe,\u0026rdquo; Pat concluded. \u0026ldquo;Does everyone understand our situation?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because your milk is stronger, we will change more quickly than you did,\u0026rdquo; Martin offered. \u0026ldquo;And if we don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;will\u0026rdquo; our changes, we may end up as something other than what we wish.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right, but there is good news,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued. \u0026ldquo;As we have all discovered, the more energy and focus there is, the easier it is to control the change. So, as each new mermaid is created, the process should get faster and easier.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know how many feeders any one person can actually hold,\u0026rdquo; worried John. \u0026ldquo;Remember how hard it was for you to reach your last feeder?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It was a lot of work,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, \u0026ldquo;but the only way to find out is to try.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Gail,\u0026rdquo; Petra asked, \u0026ldquo;are you feeling up for this?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t miss it, not even if I was already dead,\u0026rdquo; she said with a grin.\nMartin sat nervously in the early evening moonlight, his feet dangling in the water, trying to watch what was going on below him in the pool. Rikki was in the center of the circle, her body glowing with energy, her tail nearly finished. He was next; actually, he was last. They had discovered that none of the \u0026ldquo;guests\u0026rdquo; could stay down in the water for long; their gills were too immature. Mai Lin had gone first, while Michael and John had stayed out of the water so that all the women could focus their energy to help Mai Lin transition to a male mermaid. Cleo and Rikki added their focus to that first circle too, but they had to keep rising for air every ten minutes or so. Their immature gills allowed them to stay down longer than normal humans, but they still had to breath regular air. Still, they bobbed up and down for the entire time, knowing that Mai Lin was becoming their pod-mate.\nMai Lin, or Mu Su, as he renamed himself, didn\u0026rsquo;t have to keep rising up, however. Once under the influence of the massive dose of milk, her/his gills had started working quickly, and he was able to stay down for the duration. He took eleven hours to transition. Mu Su, whose new name meant, \u0026ldquo;longed for revival,\u0026rdquo; then became the \u0026ldquo;first feeder\u0026rdquo; for Shou Ling, and the group discovered that men were not nearly as potent as the women. Shou Ling had to rise for a breath of air despite swallowing Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s impressive load, but once Petra had given her a double dose of milk from her impressive breasts, Shou Ling was well on her way. Her \u0026ldquo;last feeder\u0026rdquo; was Michael, since she was joining his pod, and he experienced the longest orgasm of his life, shooting pulse after pulse into her trance-like embrace. Shou Ling hung in the water, glowing and changing, for only eight hours. She renamed herself Xing Hua, or \u0026ldquo;new flower.\u0026rdquo;\nThere seemed to be a geometric relationship between the potency of the fluids and the number of people contributing. After Cleo finished in only six hours, Phoebe bet Pat that Rikki would be done in four hours. Pat said three, but that Martin would take one hour. Both Phoebe and Martin had nearly choked on their food. Mu Su was the last feeder for Rikki, and for Cleo since they were joining his pod, and Rikki was nearly done, less than three hours later.\nThat thought both frightened him and filled him with excitement. Trying to understand the titanic forces at work in their bodies as they changed their form, and in his case, his sex, was difficult. Trying to imagine those same forces at work in a mere hour was beyond him. What would it feel like? He had dipped down, from time to time, to watch as his sisters changed. Rikki\u0026rsquo;s transition seemed to be even more violent than was Cleo\u0026rsquo;s, her rigid body rippling and convulsing, twisting and shaking. Cleo had reassured him during that last meal break, that she didn\u0026rsquo;t feel much discomfort, and now that she was fully transformed, she felt better than ever before in her life.\nHe remembered back to the first time he stole his sister\u0026rsquo;s underwear. They were 12, and Cleo and Rikki were blossoming into beautiful young women. Martin was a little jealous of all the attention they were getting, and when his puberty hit a year later, he grew more and more awkward and unhappy with his body. Slowly but inexorably, he had been shut out from his two best playmates, and he wished with growing fervor that he had been born one of three identical twins, rather than a fraternal twin to two identical twins. So, he had retreated into his imagination, his diary, and the world of magic, where things like mermaids existed.\nA sudden movement below stirred him from his reverie. Rikki\u0026rsquo;s glowing body suddenly arched backwards, a signal that she would be shortly released from the grip of transition. Mermaids weren\u0026rsquo;t magic any more, Martin mused. He would become one himself soon.\nAs with the other transitions, the group rose as one and fell upon the food that they had gathered in anticipation of their guests before their rescue. Martin, who wasn\u0026rsquo;t hungry at all, watched the colorful and beautiful crush of merfolk as they jostled each other to reach for the food. Cleo and Rikki were identical twins still, both beautiful with perfectly even, mottled blue and white scales with yellow highlights along their fins, flukes, webs, and dorsal ridges. Their shining blue eyes were even bluer, jewel-like in their intensity. Their short dark brown hair was now a long and lustrous chocolate brown that flowed down to their expanded hips. Their full C cups had remained the same, which made them look girlish next to Petra and Pat, but they were about the same as the rest of the mermaids. Like them, their nipples had matured and were thicker and longer than previously.\n\u0026ldquo;You sure you don\u0026rsquo;t want to eat,\u0026rdquo; asked Cleo, twisting her upper torso 180 degrees without moving her tail as it stretched out behind her. \u0026ldquo;It will help you later,\u0026rdquo; she nudged Rikki and they both giggled girlishly.\nPat had explained to them at the last feeding that when they were all changed, sleep would finally take them, but only after their sexual appetites had been sated. Petra and Gail explained that the transition would really make them feel like new people-that they were a new species even-and that the abuse at the hands of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men would slowly wash away. John teased Mu Su that he would likely be put to the test with three newly transitioned mermaids to deal with. He had merely smiled, a coiled spring of confident, new manhood, which had made Cleo and Rikki swoon with anticipation, and even Martin was excited thinking about being held by Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s strong arms, being pressed to his washboard stomach, and feeling his impressive cock push its way into his body.\nMartin walked over to his sisters, thinking that he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing that for much longer, and reached for some dried fish. He was even a bit embarrassed that he had an erection in anticipation of what Cleo had meant.\n\u0026ldquo;You soon beautiful on outside as you were on inside,\u0026rdquo; Mu Su said gently, \u0026ldquo;I happy you are excited to be beautiful. Feel no shame in erection, for I know how you feel, and soon \u0026hellip; you know how I felt when I was girl.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, Mu Su,\u0026rdquo; Martin blushed. \u0026ldquo;I hope you will like me when I am a girl.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You, I have liked always,\u0026rdquo; he responded as he gave Martin\u0026rsquo;s face a gentle caress, \u0026ldquo;you I will never forget, your kindness and courage before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are as handsome now as you were beautiful before,\u0026rdquo; Martin said with a quaver in his voice. \u0026ldquo;Inside and outside.\u0026rdquo;\nMu Su was striking with his strongly featured face, jet-black hair, his broad shoulders and strong hands, his yellow and black striped tail with yellow highlights, and his dark brown, nearly black eyes. Martin let his gaze wash over his soon-to-be pod-mate.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, don\u0026rsquo;t hog,\u0026rdquo; teased Rikki as she poked her brother in the ribs. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going to have to share.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;All right, enough,\u0026rdquo; teased Xing. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go in pool and do last one, so all can get (cough, cough) rest.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got your rest, you minx,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, slapping his tail suggestively.\nXing was a minx, whose new coloring subtly complimented her pod-mates. Her tail was a dark forest green with lavender highlights on fins, flukes, webs, and dorsal membrane, the opposite of Petra. She had the only hazel eyes of the pod, but she shared Michael\u0026rsquo;s and Gail\u0026rsquo;s jetblack hair. Her Asian features were still visible, and her C cup breasts looked positively enormous on her slender frame. \u0026ldquo;O.K., I ready for many rests,\u0026rdquo; she said smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;In the water, both of you,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, mothering. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s all go,\u0026rdquo; as she took Gail\u0026rsquo;s hand, gave her a peck on the cheek, and dove into the pool.\nMartin took a deep breath and dove into the center of the pool. His slender body sliced down cleanly through the water, and he pulled up even with the assembled group. They looked beautiful in the moonlight, glowing and pulsing with energy. Rikki reached out her arms to him, and he floated to her.\n\u0026ldquo;What will my new sister\u0026rsquo;s name be?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Emma,\u0026rdquo; he answered. His two sisters smiled in recognition and approval. It was their mother\u0026rsquo;s name.\n\u0026ldquo;You will be my sister-wife, will you take from my breasts your tail,\u0026rdquo; she intoned.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, \u0026hellip; oh god, yes,\u0026rdquo; Martin whispered fervently, and he fell upon his sister\u0026rsquo;s large nipple.\nHe drank deeply, feeling the pressure in his lungs lessen with each gulp, and when he had finished both breasts, he floated effortlessly to Cleo.\n\u0026ldquo;Sister from birth, and sister-wife from this day forward,\u0026rdquo; Martin sang, like all those before, \u0026ldquo;will you give me my tail?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Come, drink from me my sister, who has been my sister always in truth,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said with a sad smile for the little brother that had been so unhappy for so many years.\nMartin felt the energy build in his body as he drank from Cleo\u0026rsquo;s breasts. He could feel Rikki, who had floated down to his legs, and was slowly stroking them up and down, sending tremors throughout his body. He focused on the strong and powerful mermaid that Phoebe had helped coach him on, one that was identical to his sisters, an identical triplet he had always wished he could be. Cleo\u0026rsquo;s breasts had been generous, and he turned to Michael as he felt Cleo join her sister at his legs.\n\u0026ldquo;Merman who was once a woman,\u0026rdquo; Martin intoned, \u0026ldquo;make this boy a mermaid, and give me my tail.\u0026rdquo;\nMichael tugged free his quickly expanding cock, and looked down at Martin. The combined forces of his sister\u0026rsquo;s milk were already at work on his body, his features softening, his hair growing, his body changing. Martin tentatively took hold of his cock, and Michael waited patiently, he knew this was a moment of mental transition for Martin. After a few seconds, Martin slowly put his lips over the head of Michael\u0026rsquo;s long and thick cock. He was surprised, even though he had seen it with his sisters, when Michael\u0026rsquo;s cock immediately erupted into his mouth. He swallowed urgently, but some cum leaked out into the water. Petra eased forward and sucked the strand of ropy cum from the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Waste not, want not, Emma,\u0026rdquo; she said as she shared a kiss with Gail and Xing.\nEmma \u0026hellip; yes, now Emma, she thought to herself as her mind focused more clearly on the changes she was undergoing, turned to Petra, and asked for her tail, and when she had drained Petra\u0026rsquo;s bounty, she could feel that she was transitioning quickly into a woman. She could feel her waist narrowing, slowly but steadily, and her hips expanding, reshaping themselves, even as her legs grew stiff and straight. The hips had hurt, but not as much as she thought it might.\nDuring the time it took for Emma to pass from Petra to Gail and then to Xing, she became a woman completely. Emma delighted as her nipples expanded, and then slowly pushed out, pushing into Xing\u0026rsquo;s tummy as she suckled at her breast. Now, as she floated away from Xing, she could feel the firm weight of her C cup breasts hang from her narrow rib cage, her long hair floating over her shoulders and gills, and her delicate and feminine body as it moved through the water. She knew her face was changing, matching her sisters'. Still, there was great energy gathered in her body, pulsing up and down and in and out.\nNow fully a woman, she reached for John. \u0026ldquo;First father of first pod, give me my tail,\u0026rdquo; she sang. She was ready for John\u0026rsquo;s healthy deposit, and Pat, Danni, and Phoebe shared a wink with Petra and company because no extras escaped from Emma\u0026rsquo;s eager mouth this time. Her body was now glowing, filling with power and energy.\n\u0026ldquo;First mother, first woman, give me my tail,\u0026rdquo; Emma sang as she fell onto Pat\u0026rsquo;s breasts. As she finished with Pat and moved onto Danni, she could feel her sisters pull away from her legs, and she was dimly aware that they had already begun to knit together. Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s breasts were next, and Emma was quivering as she struggled to maintain control. She had to get to Mu Su; he had to be last.\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe, give me my tail,\u0026rdquo; Emma asked. Phoebe pulled the desperately shaking Emma to her breast where she sucked eagerly at her nipple. Phoebe could tell that Emma was close, and that the forces she was battling were enormous. Phoebe concentrated on merely giving milk to her, not the bonding orgasm that simmered close to the surface of her breasts. For long agonizing moments, she held off her own release, forcing both herself and Emma to wait for Mu Su. Then, she was done, and Phoebe was practically gasping with need, but she exerted a supreme effort of self-control, and rejoined the humming that surrounded the beautiful half-creature that swirled before them.\nEmma slowly turned to Mu Su, a great need burning in her eyes, her body quaking as she struggled to hold on. \u0026ldquo;My mate \u0026hellip; my Mu Su \u0026hellip; give \u0026hellip; me \u0026hellip; me \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; As Emma struggled to maintain control, Mu Su raised his stiff cock up to her lips and held it there. \u0026ldquo;Give \u0026hellip; me \u0026hellip; my \u0026hellip; TAIL,\u0026rdquo; Emma shouted and gulped Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s thick and long cock as far down her throat as she could. His eruption was instantaneous, and Rikki and Cleo had to hold him in place, so that his own convulsions would not remove his cock from Emma\u0026rsquo;s mouth. He had never felt anything so powerful, such a ripping out from the depths of his body a portion of his own being. In six enormous spurts, he gave Emma her last dose, and she released his cock and stiffened into the familiar cross of transformation, her arms outstretched horizontally, her legs rigidly pointing to the pool\u0026rsquo;s bottom.\nEmma\u0026rsquo;s final transformation seemed magical as they watched her body shift, throb, shake, push, and change. For Emma, she felt great waves that pulsed from her still new womb and radiated out through her entire body. Then a great urge to push arose, and she bore down with her muscles onto her rigid legs, feeling bone, muscle, and blood break, merge, and reform. She convulsed again, pushing, pushing, pushing, and felt her new appendage lengthen and her flukes emerge. Her newly forming swimming muscles wove their way through her body, pulsing in her tail, and threading up through her pelvis and torso. She convulsed again, and felt her skin change, and her webbing appear. She convulsed again, and felt her hair lengthen again, and her organs shift, strengthen, and change. Then she arched in ecstasy, her shimmering blue and white tail, mottled with even spots of color, hanging above her shining eyes.\nIt had taken less than an hour.\nEmma could sense the passion and release that was filling the pool with electrical energy from every direction. Even with her eyes closed, she could both sense and actually hear the frenzied sexual activity from both John\u0026rsquo;s and Michael\u0026rsquo;s pods. This was no surprise; everyone had been forewarned. It was just that Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s pod was new to the incredible feelings and sensations that their new bodies were sending them in the wake of their transformations.\nEmma was finally a girl, even better \u0026hellip; a mermaid! After years as an awkward, shy, and sensitive male, who missed the closeness his twin sisters had shared with him for most of his seventeen years, the newest mermaid was still sorting out all the signals that her now identical body sent. Like Cleo and Rikki, Emma was a beautiful mermaid, with long dark hair, piercing blue eyes, an hour-glass figure with firm, full C cup breasts topped by full and chewy nipples, her breasts already swelling with her own milk.\nEmma ran her hands along her narrow chin, swan-like neck, across the swell of her breasts, feeling the stiff promontory of her nipples, following the curve underneath back to her rib cage, a full four inches behind her tightly clenched nipples, and then down across her slim, flat stomach and a tiny waist. The soft swell of her female belly warmed her, made her womb throb pleasantly in her lower abdomen. She felt the slightest change in texture as her skin merged with the brightly mottled blue and white scales that marked the beginning of her tail even as her slim waist flared out to wide, sensuous hips, that could now flex in both directions. Her tail extended a full five feet beyond her hips, sinuously undulating in the water, a beautiful tail with wide flukes, over three feet across, in which she could feel the water move across her scales like a lover\u0026rsquo;s caress.\nEmma had a momentary regret, never having felt what wide hips did for a woman\u0026rsquo;s gait, the gap between her legs where her pussy would have been. However, a flash of luminescence that ran up the length of her dorsal membrane reminded her of the benefits she did have. Her flukes fanned out in a quivering expression of her mounting sexual need, as her sisters reached out to her to draw her towards Mu Su.\nHe floated there before her, his magnificent yellow and black tail gently stroking the water back and forth, his dark back eyes seeming to pierce her through her heart, and his jet-black hair streaming down his shoulders, his broad and very muscular shoulders, she noted. She could see that his long cock was already freed from his interior vent, a long, thick throbbing appendage that was a foot long, its head swollen with his passion. Emma\u0026rsquo;s two sisters had argued that Mu Su and she were the only \u0026ldquo;virgins\u0026rdquo; in their pod, the sisters having been raped countless times by Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men, and therefore, they should be the first \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; coupling. Their generosity was tempered, in Emma\u0026rsquo;s mind, by the knowledge that Pat had shared with them about mermale anatomy, namely that his hip fins stiffened and vibrated when his cock was similarly stimulated. The result was that three mermaids could find nearly equal pleasure from their pod-mate at the same time.\nRikki\u0026rsquo;s hand was on Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s cock, stroking it slowly, while Cleo\u0026rsquo;s hand was on Emma\u0026rsquo;s breast, stroking her nipple. Emma could see that both of her sisters were equally aroused, their genital vents were open and pulsing, their clitoral ridge exposed and ready for stimulation. All three sister\u0026rsquo;s breasts were swollen with passion, ready to push milk from their breasts at the moment of climax. Mu Su reached with his hand to Emma\u0026rsquo;s graceful neck, and pulled her into a passionate kiss. Their tongues dueled as Emma pushed her breasts into his chest, his cock poking her in her belly. Cleo settled onto Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s left shoulder, and Rikki grabbed his right one, still stroking his cock with the other hand. They both pushed their clits against Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fins, which had stiffened and were beginning to vibrate slightly, and wrapped their tails around his and each other\u0026rsquo;s. They both started rubbing their own breasts against Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s elbow fins, delighting as their nipples caught on his scalloped edges.\nEmma\u0026rsquo;s heart felt like it would explode from her chest. She knew what was expected, but she had never had the equipment to perform this sexual act. She could feel her pelvic region swollen with blood and need, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t know where all her parts actually were. She wrapped her own tail around her sisters' and Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s, and tried to push his cock into her hungry vagina. She missed, and Mu Su gasped as his cock caught on her pelvic fin.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; she whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;It is O.K.,\u0026rdquo; he nuzzled her lips as he replied, \u0026ldquo;take your time.\u0026rdquo;\nHer sisters solved the problem as Rikki guided Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s cock directly into her opening while Cleo pushed against Emma\u0026rsquo;s hips, guiding her down onto him. Emma gasped into Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s kiss as she felt the large head of his cock slip past her outer lips and into her pussy. She held her hips steady, accommodating herself to his great thickness and to the impending loss of her very brief virginity. She could feel herself begin to relax internally, and pushed again until his cockhead met the stiff resistance of her newly created womanhood. She pushed a second time, but met the same resistance.\n\u0026ldquo;Try to relax,\u0026rdquo; Mu Su whispered into her ear as he nuzzled her neck and ear lobe. \u0026ldquo;I lost my virginity once too.\u0026rdquo;\nHe caressed her sides, following the dramatic contours of her waist and hips until he grabbed her pelvic fins and pulled her into him using their entwined tails to push himself into her. Their combined efforts succeeded, and after a sharp, brief pain, Emma felt her insides melting as the fullness of his cock stretched her completely. Then he began to move, and the heat from Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s strokes rose as he built up speed and rhythm. Emma looked at her sister Cleo, who was now concentrating on what Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s fin was doing to her clit, her eyes glazed with passion, but flickered with love and recognition as she saw her new sister gazing at her. She lifted a hand from Emma\u0026rsquo;s hip where she no longer needed to guide her sister\u0026rsquo;s hips onto their husband-pod-mate, and stroked Emma\u0026rsquo;s face and her full lips, now identical to her own. Emma kissed her sisters fingers, even as she felt Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s cock swell with in her, reaching up into her torso to places she never thought possible.\nEmma turned to Rikki, who was also caught in the throes of a steadily building orgasm, her bright blue eyes lidded and sightless, one hand clutched on Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s neck, the other on Emma\u0026rsquo;s hip, pushing her pelvis against Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s fin, her breasts brushing his arm. Emma looked back into Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s eyes, his dark, strong eyes, and saw the glimmering of a break in his calm, confident exterior. She could see his building need, his first orgasm caused by love making, rather than by mermaid making. She thrilled to the passion and lust she saw in his eyes, the raw need visible in his eyes that drank in her face, her hair, her neck, her breasts as they shook in the water with each powerful thrust by Mu Su. She could feel her flesh quiver in response to each thrust, her hips, her muscles along the back of her tail, and her lovely breasts.\nEmma could feel the building tensions of her first female orgasm, building a rising tide of tension in her womb and stomach wall, pushing down on Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s cock as it stroked in and out. She lifted up her face and reached for Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s lips, and he bent down, still stroking powerfully in and out of her vagina, and kissed her. Her body imploded, and her cunt walls clenched down on Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s powerful cock. He gasped into their kiss, and he exploded his hot semen into her. She could feel the throb of his cock inside her, the power of each pulse as his cock pushed past her powerful, rippling muscles inside her birth canal, forcing his seed deep within her. She could feel her breasts release their milk into the water, and she could feel the warm spurts of milk from her sisters as they joined her in their release. For the longest time, she was suspended in the water by Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s stiff cock still pulsing within her, with her entire body still clenching around that welcome invader.\nShe fell asleep some hours later, the moonlight now barely visible, and the other pods had long ago succumbed to sleep. Emma had just thrashed through her sixth orgasm of the evening, this one on Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s right hip, as Cleo felt the power and warmth of Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s endlessly ready cock buried deep with in her.\n\u0026ldquo;That is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve had an orgasm while getting fucked,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said in surprise.\n\u0026ldquo;It won\u0026rsquo;t be the last,\u0026rdquo; Mu Su assured her, as he wrapped his strong arms around all three identical sisters and gave them a hug. Emma gave Cleo a peck on the cheek even as she snuggled next to her, sharing Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s chest as her pillow with her two sisters, their tails entwined now in love and comfort, rather than passion and need. Her last thought was that now they could make some plans to deal with Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men, and that it would be fun.\n06 - The Battle for Mermaid Island The first three were an accident-luck really.\nPhoebe and Pat were giving Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s pod and Xing (all the newest merfolk) their third \u0026ldquo;teaching tour\u0026rdquo; around the island. In the two weeks since their transformations, they had been keeping clear of the original lagoon, and were careful not to be too close to the surface. They were focusing on reefs and other places along the drop-off where they could gather food, not the island itself. The rest of Michael\u0026rsquo;s pod (because Xing was with the tour) was on spy duty that morning while John and Danni were in the Listening Room. Pat smiled as she thought of her pod mates back in the listening room. Unlike Danni, who was no doubt trying to distract John from listening, these newest mermaids were all eager students. They had made significant headway in their efforts to collect a food surplus in anticipation of their up-coming battle.\nThis morning they were moving along the sharp, drop-off along the north side of the island working their way to the eastern caves. There was only a very short land shelf along the north side, and there was no land shelf along the western side where the entrance to their system of home caves lay hidden. To the east and south, however, a large land shelf had built up from many eruptions of the volcano that was the father of this island. Pat explained that the drop-off was boundary between the father island and the mother sea, and that their union produced the bounty upon which the mermaid\u0026rsquo;s lives depended. The eastern land shelf sloped more quickly than the southern one, so that the waves that rose to crash on these rocks formed quickly and suddenly, only about ten meters from the rocky shore. There were many shallow caves scattered among the rocky beaches, but they were not interconnected as their \u0026ldquo;home caves\u0026rdquo; were, and no system of tunnels existed here.\nThe group was about twenty meters from the shore in five meters of water, harvesting mollusks. Pat had created \u0026ldquo;sea bags\u0026rdquo; from some plastic netting Michael and Gail had salvaged from the drop-off. The bags were secured around their hips with holes for their pelvic fins, allowing them good flexibility along their tails while keeping their hands free for harvesting and swimming. Mu Su had the biggest bag, and he was a very quick study, memorizing the many different types of squids, chitons, univalves, tusk shells, bivalves, and octopi. Of course, Xing and Mu Su had grown up eating exotic animals, unlike everyone else, and that helped too. The others were slowly learning and adapting to what was edible and what wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nPat sighed happily as she watched everyone at work harvesting. The triplets were naturals in the water, and as she watched them dart in and out of the coral, laughing and playing even as they worked-it was hard to tell them apart. Everyone had discovered, however, that each of them had a very different personality. Rikki and Cleo had taken some time to come out of their emotional shells, but the last two weeks had brought some healing. Cleo was the graceful, reserved one, and she was unfailingly gentle. Rikki was the prankster, usually pulling practical jokes, but she was also the leader of her sisters, willing and ready to take risks. Emma was the mother, the worrier, and the budding scientist who nevertheless was also the most girlish of the triplets, reveling in her newfound femininity. Even though they were identical triplets, each of their tails were subtly different, and-more importantly for mermaids-their electrical signatures were easily distinguishable from one another.\nAll three girls were devoted to Mu Su, who returned their devotion. His dramatic, tiger-stripped tail flashed in the morning sun. He was also a gentle spirit, but his martial arts training gave him a coiled confidence that his girls adored, and Pat and the others also appreciated. He was also randy as hell, and both he and Emma were insatiable. They were constantly teasing and flirting with one another, even when there was work to be done.\nPat probed behind her with her mermaid senses and found Xing and Phoebe hard at work on the other side of the rock outcropping upon which she sat. Xing had bonded well with Michael\u0026rsquo;s pod, and this morning\u0026rsquo;s teaching tour was the first time she had ventured out without one of her pod mates. She and Phoebe were working together, however, which seemed to give her some confidence.\nPat stretched out her senses, taking stock of the surrounding sea. Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s pod was about forty meters further south, while Phoebe and Xing were just behind her. Pat was perched only about two meters below the surface, and she could sense the water as it rose and crashed into the rocks along the shore. She realized suddenly with a clench of fear in her gut that she could sense three men among the caves behind her. She quickly slid down the rock to Phoebe and Xing.\n\u0026ldquo;You sensed it too?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Three men, the second cave down,\u0026rdquo; Pat said as both Phoebe and Xing nodded. Pat sent out a high pitch pulse of vocal energy that they had discovered was an excellent underwater alarm, and a few moments later, Mu Su and the girls swam up to them.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s up?\u0026rdquo; Rikki asked.\nPat pointed with her hand to the shore, where the only sounds they could hear were the rolling waves as they crashed into the rocks. Everyone focused their senses up towards the beach.\n\u0026ldquo;Three men, second cave down,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said.\n\u0026ldquo;The sea must be high today,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe noted, \u0026ldquo;the water seems very loud.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There might be a storm further east,\u0026rdquo; Pat surmised, \u0026ldquo;and the rising waves seem to have trapped those three in that smaller cave.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll go take a look,\u0026rdquo; Mu Su offered. \u0026ldquo;The surf sounds a bit strong for you ladies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ha,\u0026rdquo; shot back Rikki, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll race you!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, Rikki, don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; asked Emma. \u0026ldquo;The surf is high, and Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s a much stronger swimmer than we are, and he can fight through the backwash. We can\u0026rsquo;t. It\u0026rsquo;s also nearing high tide.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;High tide is only about a meter,\u0026rdquo; Rikki argued.\n\u0026ldquo;But with a storm to the east, it\u0026rsquo;s much higher than normal,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s probably why those men got trapped in the water.\u0026rdquo;\nMu Su gave a quick kiss to Rikki as consolation, and swam off towards the crashing surf. The girls spent a few tense minutes waiting, and then he returned.\n\u0026ldquo;The sea is high, and the men are up to their chests in water,\u0026rdquo; he explained. \u0026ldquo;The backwash isn\u0026rsquo;t too bad in the cave, but it\u0026rsquo;s strong enough that those men aren\u0026rsquo;t trying to get out the front of the cave. It\u0026rsquo;s only about two meters deep, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t moving.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did they have any guns?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;but I didn\u0026rsquo;t get that close.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We should call the others,\u0026rdquo; Pat recommended.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said quietly but firmly, \u0026ldquo;we don\u0026rsquo;t have time.\u0026rdquo;\nPat looked around at the group and realized that all of them except for her had suffered deeply at the hands of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men. These new mermaids and mermen were not going to let this opportunity pass them by. For the past two weeks, the remaining gang members had stayed far away from the water, and most had moved up to the mountainside huts. Their absence from the water, and the knowledge that the merfolk\u0026rsquo;s mobility on anything other than the beach would be difficult and impossible on narrow jungle paths, had frustrated everyone. They might now control the water, but little could be done if Alberto and his men stayed away from it.\n\u0026ldquo;First,\u0026rdquo; Pat chided, \u0026ldquo;everyone breathe. I know this is personal for you, but I will not go back to Michael and tell him that his pod-mate got killed because we weren\u0026rsquo;t thinking.\u0026rdquo; Xing smiled tightly at the reference to her status.\n\u0026ldquo;I no get killed,\u0026rdquo; she said with determination.\n\u0026ldquo;Nevertheless,\u0026rdquo; Pat said steadily, \u0026ldquo;we need a plan. How long before the tide begins to ebb?\u0026rdquo; she asked Phoebe.\nPhoebe closed her eyes and concentrated, feeling the water along the rocks, sensing which direction it was moving, and how quickly.\n\u0026ldquo;High tide crested about an hour ago,\u0026rdquo; she reported. \u0026ldquo;That gives us about two hours before the water is low enough for these guys to escape.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mu Su, how big was that cave?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Thirty meters deep, about ten meters at mouth and five meters wide, rear of cave,\u0026rdquo; he reported.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, \u0026ldquo;here\u0026rsquo;s the plan.\u0026rdquo;\nGail felt Petra\u0026rsquo;s warm flanks next to her own as they wriggled to their usual spot for spying on the beach huts, hidden in the undergrowth along the western arm of the lagoon. For the past two weeks, there had been very little activity at the beach huts. Alberto and his remaining men had retreated to the mountainside huts soon after the rescue attempt. The only exception was the two women, who still came down to their beach hut nearly every day, but they rarely come down into the water. They came down to cook, mostly, and usually three men came too, using the beach tackle that they had brought ashore before their boats had been sunk. One man always stayed up the beach, armed with a gun, while the other two pulled in fish from the lagoon. Afterwards, the women would clean and prepare the fish and take it back up the mountainside.\nThis morning was different. No men had come down to fish. Both women were in the surf, bathing each other. Gail and the others had learned from the Mu Su and Xing, who had spent the longest in captivity, that one of the women, Angara, was a cousin of Alberto. He let them keep one another company, and in return expected his own domestic needs to be met. He would occasionally demand the sexual services from the women, but he preferred captives whom he could beat, rape, and kill with impunity. Mu Su had thought that they might become allies for the merfolk, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t know how they might go about contacting them, nor could Mu Su be sure of their loyalties to Alberto. He knew both Angara and her lover, Saya, despised most of the gang, but Alberto was \u0026ldquo;family.\u0026rdquo; Finally, Mu Su had never heard them speak anything other than Spanish, and so he didn\u0026rsquo;t know if they even understood English or Chinese, the two languages the pods could currently speak.\n\u0026ldquo;Any body else coming?\u0026rdquo; whispered Petra as she settled next to her sister-wife.\n\u0026ldquo;Not yet,\u0026rdquo; Gail said. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s that on the beach, near their clothing?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, trying to keep her head down even as she raised herself up to peer at the beach where the women had left their clothes.\n\u0026ldquo;We need to get closer,\u0026rdquo; Gail said, starting to wiggle backwards towards the surf on the far side of the spit of land that enclosed the lagoon.\n\u0026ldquo;We need Michael,\u0026rdquo; Petra urged as she followed her lover back to the water.\nAs usual, Michael had already figured out what their collective thoughts were, and met them in the middle of the lagoon. They decided that they would chance a possible contact, but wouldn\u0026rsquo;t reveal their status as mermaids. They swam slowly towards the beach, keeping close to the bottom so that they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be spotted by any lookout posted at the hot tub high above on the mountain. When they reached a depth of about two meters, about fifteen meters from shore, Gail rose to the surface. Petra and Michael watched carefully, their senses fully extended, concentrating on the reaction of the two women who were in the surf, with the water lapping at their knees.\nGail kept her head low to the water, as there was only a gentle swell of a few inches here in the lagoon, but the women were not looking out at the water, but rather at the spot on the beach where the trail came down from the mountain. They were worried about being caught by some of the gang members as they bathed in the surf. Figures, Gail thought to herself, the men could probably go for weeks without bathing, but the women would be more fastidious. The two women took no notice of her as she peered carefully at the scene before her.\nThe two women were short, as with most Filipinos, and while it was difficult to tell how old they were, they were both well beyond thirtyfive. They might have been prettier in their younger days, but life as the nursemaids to a pirate/drug gang had not been kind to them. It was then that Gail noticed what was on the beach.\n\u0026ldquo;Help us.\u0026rdquo;\nIn English, scratched into the sand with a stick, next to their clothes.\nDanni and John lay on a small ledge that formed part of the listening room. Danni had insisted that they spend a long time out of the water, and so they had been lying together on the cave floor for over an hour. John didn\u0026rsquo;t understand why she wanted to lie on the hard, rocky floor of the cave when they could float in the pool with ease and still hear all the listening channels that snaked throughout the island. In the past two days, they had learned that Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men had talked themselves out of their fear of the water, with the two women leading the argument. The merfolk had to piece things together as the infrequent English phrases echoed down only occasionally. The gang had to speak English occasionally because it was the only common language among the mixed Filipino, Thai, and Australian gang members.\nThis morning the two women had asked for and gotten a promise of some privacy for bathing, and the men would come down to the beach the next day for fishing and feasting. Two of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men had fixed the remains of the still that John and Pat had built, and after many days of trying, their first batch of distilled fruit punch would be ready the next day. Alberto had encouraged these plans to build morale, and the men had gone off to harvest food and game from the jungle while the women went to the beach to bath, fish, and prepare for tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s feast.\nAs the listening posts quieted down, Danni lay next to John in the semi-darkness of the room and concentrated on feeling dry. She knew it was silly, but she was still adjusting to the fact that she was now a marine mammal, of sorts. Her gills, which were not a typical mammalian characteristic, where cushioned from the cave floor by both her thick, soft golden hair and by her dorsal ridge that reached mid-way up her back. Her flukes were splayed over John\u0026rsquo;s tail, softly stroking his strong muscles that rippled up and down his impressive steel grey tail.\nShe loved the feel of his strong, smooth flanks as they rippled under the feathery edges of her flukes. It was sort of like feeling with her toes, she thought. She concentrated on her tail, trying to remember her legs, feet, and toes, but her tail didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like her legs were still there, bound up and moving together. Her tail felt like, well, her tail. It was strong and thick, but supple and flexible at the same time. She flexed her muscles that made her flukes spread, and then lifted her flukes 90 degrees up and then pushed them down, easily reaching 90 degrees in both directions. John began playing with his own flukes as she twisted hers 180 degrees clockwise, and then again counter clockwise, her wispy blue fringe that decorated the ends of her fluke sparkling with faint blue light as the cool air whispered through her fringe membranes. That rush of sensation prompted the memory of when her beautiful sister-wife, Pat, had explained how her sparkling blue dorsal membrane, now pleasantly squished by Danni\u0026rsquo;s own weight into the cave floor, was also one of her main sensory organs. In fact, all her fringes on fins, flukes, and dorsal ridge could feel temperature and texture, and were a part of how she felt her way in dark tunnels, sensing the world around her.\nShe lowered her tail back onto John\u0026rsquo;s, caressing him again, trickling her fluke-fringes over his steel-gray tail, brushing herself back and forth against him. She felt his warmth up and down along her tail, his smooth scales rubbing hers, his muscles twitching beneath her flukes as she tickled him. Their pelvic fins also played a game of pattyfingers, brushing and stroking one another. Her whole body felt alive with touch, and her heart was pounding in her chest. God, she loved being a mermaid; a beautiful powerful, golden tail, her long golden hair, her silvery laughter, her hourglass figure, her firm, full breasts with their long, sensitive nipples, her delicate hands and glimmering fingernails. She was intoxicated and intoxicating.\nAs Danni lay on her back, her head nestled in the crook of John\u0026rsquo;s strong arm, she lifted one hand up to her breast. She had gotten so used to feeling her body in the water that she really wanted to feel her body on the land. Here, her breasts sagged off to each side, but only a little, and she enjoyed the small tightness at the center of her chest as each breast tugged slightly outward. She watched as her breasts rose and fell with her steady breathing. She enjoyed the feeling of air rushing through her nostrils, something that didn\u0026rsquo;t happen when she was under water. Her gaze followed her ribs down as they narrowed quickly to her delicate waist, which seemed all the more delicate for being perched atop her strong and beautiful mermaid\u0026rsquo;s tail. She ran her hand around her breasts, one at a time, savoring their fullness. She pulled at one of her long nipples, rolling it in between her index and thumb, her webbing rustling along her hand as she did so.\nHer groin tightened, sending tendrils of warmth radiating outward from her belly and tail. She could feel her labia opening, nearly two hand spans below her belly button. When they had transformed into mermaids and mermen, their sexual organs had dropped slightly into their new tails. Their anal opening was another hand span lower, but on the same side as their genitalia. There didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be the same sensitivities to that repositioned opening has had existed previously, but their new sexual organs more than made up for that lack. She could feel her new, slightly larger, clit swell with blood as she continued to stroke her own breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be listening,\u0026rdquo; John murmured.\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone is out and about collecting stuff for tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s feast,\u0026rdquo; Danni countered, turning on her side and rolling into his embrace. \u0026ldquo;We can listen and nuzzle.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nuzzle?\u0026rdquo; asked John as he felt Danni\u0026rsquo;s hand reach down his tail to stroke along the sides of his vent. The blood rushed quickly to his penis, and he quickly pulled on his vent muscle to release his now growing cock into the dim light of the cave, now getting brighter as their sexual overtures caused their bio-chemical luminescence to grow. As he looked down at their entwined tails, he thought that it looked a little bit like those posters from the late sixties and early seventies: a funky UV black-light show as their tails flashed color and light into this small space.\nAs Danni stroked John\u0026rsquo;s fish-flanks, she marveled at how silky smooth he felt, both in his tail and in upper torso and hair. She remembered Pat\u0026rsquo;s explanation that their new skin, scales, and hair were actually covered with millions of tiny ridges, micronodules, that made their bodies hydrophobic, which Danni thought was a funny word to use for mermaids. She would never be the science student Pat wanted her to be. What Danni cared about was how incredibly smooth and soft their skin felt, like the purest silk, and this smoothness seemed to enhance their own sense of touch and of being touched, because their entire body was covered with these micronodules, tiny nanostructures that helped them slide through the water. Danni wondered if those same micronodules covered John\u0026rsquo;s rising cock.\n\u0026ldquo;Ouungh,\u0026rdquo; John sighed as he felt Danni\u0026rsquo;s hand grasp his stiffening cock by the base and give it a tug.\nYes, they did. Good. Danni loved the way his cock felt in her hand, so thick, and strong, filling with blood, throbbing in her grasp, and yet so incredibly soft and smooth, like a silk lollipop. She lifted herself forward, bending at her pelvis, and gave his cock a lick. She giggled as John twitched, a bit of pre-cum visible at the tip of his large cock. She pointed it vertically, marveling at its length, as she waved it back and forth in the air. It stuck nearly fourteen inches into the air. She didn\u0026rsquo;t understand how it all fit inside her. She remembered her own penis, from long ago before she changed, and was once again grateful for all her own changes. She pointed John\u0026rsquo;s back at her mouth, and slowly let the first six inches slide past her lips.\nHer left nipple brushed against John\u0026rsquo;s hard stomach, and suddenly Danni knew why she wanted to be dry. Her wonderful breasts were dangling, not floating, and she loved the way that felt. She could feel John\u0026rsquo;s hands on her back, stroking her narrow waist, the swell of her hips, stroking the strong muscles of her tail where it joined her body. He ran his hands along her dorsal membrane, and once again she was assailed by the new feelings of wonder and sensuality that her tail created in her. She hunched her back into his caresses even as she pushed her breasts into John\u0026rsquo;s stomach and sucked on his cock with vigor. John pushed his groin into her attentions, and lifted both of them into the air.\n\u0026ldquo;No yet,\u0026rdquo; Danni breathed, her own breath now ragged with passion. \u0026ldquo;I want this cock somewhere else.\u0026rdquo;\nShe rolled herself onto her lover, and felt his long cock trapped between them, reaching all the way to her belly button. She put one hand on each of his shoulders, holding herself above him, her golden hair cascading around her, her breasts dangling freely even as they began to tighten with her growing milk. She flexed her flukes and tail and lifted her body above him, holding herself with her hands and flukes over him.\n\u0026ldquo;Put it in,\u0026rdquo; she begged, \u0026ldquo;help me put it in.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn reached down and grabbed his stiff cock and aimed it towards her now dripping pussy, which was now a smooth pair of silken folds, normally invisible but now swollen and open, pulsing in her shimmering, beautiful tail. He looked with wonder at the beautiful creature suspended over him. Danni\u0026rsquo;s multicolored blue eyes were sparkling with passion; her full lips were relaxed and parted as she concentrated on moving her body over John\u0026rsquo;s cock. Her full breasts with their long nipples dangled and swayed above him as her golden body undulated sinuously, back and forth, trying to impale herself on his stiff mast. Her golden tail shimmered and sparkled as tendrils of light shot up from her flukes. It was the most erotic thing he had ever seen. He gasped as he felt her white-hot heat settle onto him, surrounding him, making him forget that his gills and dorsal membrane were now being pressed into the rocky cave floor by two bodies, not one.\n\u0026ldquo;Finally,\u0026rdquo; Danni hissed as she arched her back, marveling at her own flexibility as she raised her torso vertically above him, his cock rising through her body ramrod straight as she ground herself down into her lover, their tails pressing into each others, rustling like satin sheets. John grabbed Danni\u0026rsquo;s generous hips and helped her raise and lower her fiery pussy onto him, and he watched the wild gyrations of her breasts as her efforts grew in intensity. She grabbed his wrists, and together they worked so that Danni could flex both her tail and her arms to lift herself up and down on his marvelous cock.\nThe angle of penetration was pushing his cock forward so that it dug into her G-spot with each pass. Danni\u0026rsquo;s passion rose quickly, like a tornado, fed by the wonderful feelings of her breasts swelling, bouncing, and shaking as she pounded herself into his body, again and again. She could feel her own hair tickling her gills, her interior muscles pulling and tugging at John\u0026rsquo;s long cock. Suddenly she froze, holding only the crown of John\u0026rsquo;s cock inside her hot, and wet pussy, savoring the way he stretched her open. Her arms were shaking with effort as she held off her orgasm, her eyes screwed shut, her breath held.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on, you tease,\u0026rdquo; groaned John as he lifted his hips into her.\n\u0026ldquo;No \u0026hellip; ah \u0026hellip; wait \u0026hellip; ohhh \u0026hellip; just a \u0026hellip; uuuungh \u0026hellip; sec,\u0026rdquo; Danni begged, quivering on the edge. Then, \u0026ldquo;AAAAAHHHHHHH,\u0026rdquo; she cried as she slammed herself back down on his cock, taking him to the hilt. Her orgasm hit her like a sledgehammer, squeezing John almost painfully. Milk poured from her breasts, and John felt the warm sweet rainfall covering his face and chest. Then he felt a great release of liquid drench his cock and tail as Danni squirted in her great passion. The feeling of hot liquid rolling off his tail sent him over the edge, and he erupted into her, groaning with delight, both of their tails rustling in the air of the cave as they shook in passion and release.\nNow, that was worth trying again, thought John as he watched the lights swirl in their tails. Danni collapsed into his chest, her hair spilling over them, her breasts slick with milk sliding on his own chest. Yes, it was messy he thought as he licked some milk from his lips where Danni had rained down on him, but definitely worth trying again. After all, they only had to roll into the water to clean off. John savored the fading tremors in his tail and slowed his breathing, stroking Danni\u0026rsquo;s hair as she continued to twitch and whimper into his chest for several minutes.\nThen they heard two faint, distant, and brief thumps, followed by equally faint, distant, and brief screams of the three men in the caves as the triplet\u0026rsquo;s barbs sank into their bodies.\nThe men were terrified when they saw the three strange, large, brightly colored blue and white fish moving towards them along the rocky bottom of the cave in which they were trapped. They were chest deep in the roiling water, the occasional wave reaching all the way to the back of the cave, dousing their heads. In their unthinking panic, one man lowered his arm underwater towards the approaching fish, aiming his nine-millimeter gun at the long, undulating shapes, and fired a single shot at the approaching forms.\nThe report was loud, but the bullet bounced harmlessly from Emma\u0026rsquo;s side. Pat had been right; a bullet fired underwater isn\u0026rsquo;t lethal beyond one meter. Another gang member lowered the AK-47 he had been holding above his head and the gun jammed after only one round, and that bullet too had only traveled about two meters. The third man never had the chance to get a shot off, as the triplets charged and caught each man cleanly in the abdomen or leg. Mu Su, Xing, and Phoebe, who had hung back to give the smaller triplets enough room to maneuver for their strikes, then rushed forward and grabbed each paralyzed man by their feet, and together, all six merfolk pulled them back out into the sea.\nEach man\u0026rsquo;s eyes flared first in fear and then in desire as they saw the strange and wondrous creatures that held them in the water. Their eyes flickered in confusion, however, as each man slowly realized that he could not move. Then, the subtle lines and creases of a paralyzed human face began to clench in terror as they realized they were going to have to breathe soon, and these beautiful creatures that surrounded them, waiting and watching, had faces full of purpose and grim determination. Their faces were both beautiful and terrifying, thought Pat as she moved towards Phoebe. Phoebe shook her head, a grim look in her eye, and turned to Rikki, floating next to her, whose venom was now coursing through the terrified man\u0026rsquo;s body.\n\u0026ldquo;For my mother and father, the Henderson\u0026rsquo;s,\u0026rdquo; Rikki whispered into the dying man\u0026rsquo;s ear.\nHis eyes flashed in fearful recognition and renewed terror, but Rikki and Phoebe held him gently, effortlessly, their eyes fixed on his, until his breath-hold breakpoint was reached, and he breathed in a lungful of water. There was no violent laryngospasm, as Pat had predicted, their venom prevented this normal effort to keep water from reaching the lungs. Mu Su and Cleo, and Xing and Emma held their men as well, while Cleo and Emma whispered the same message, watching their former tormentors, rapists, and thugs aspirate water, fear and loathing burning in their eyes until the last whisper of life faded from them.\nIt was a remarkably gentle death.\nPat checked each man for a pulse, and when she was sure that each of them was dead, she nodded. All of them formed a school around the dead men, and swam them out towards the drop-off, where they knew there would be sharks. A few strokes with a utility knife, and they would let the ocean do the rest.\nThey returned to the cave, and Rikki and Cleo gathered the fallen guns, while Emma picked up the backpack one of them had abandoned earlier. Mu Su, Xing, and Phoebe gathered their net-bags, and they headed back for the western caves.\nIt had been a good morning\u0026rsquo;s work.\nPetra, Gail, and Michael burst through the Moon Pool and shot up into the air, the three of them forming a mermaid fountain of light, color, and laughter. They arced up into the large cavern, feeling the noonday sunshine down from the chimney high above. Each of them reached backwards and grabbed their flukes, somersaulting back into the water below. They sliced cleanly into the water, only Petra making any splash on her reentry, her breasts too much to compensate for. Giggling they resurfaced, giddy with their good news.\nThey immediately sensed a different energy between the other two pods that were lounging on the cave floor.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s up?\u0026rdquo; asked Gail as she pushed herself up onto the cave floor, water rolling off her face, hair, and breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;Three down, fourteen to go,\u0026rdquo; said Phoebe with a small, tight smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Five down, twelve to go,\u0026rdquo; said Petra as she lifted herself next to Gail, her lavender tail twisting in the water as she gracefully settled herself on the ledge next to her pod-mate. Well, she was looked graceful until you noticed that her generous breasts still bobbled and rose for several seconds after she had settled into her seat.\n\u0026ldquo;You got two,\u0026rdquo; asked Pat eagerly, \u0026ldquo;which ones?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We didn\u0026rsquo;t get two,\u0026rdquo; Gail explained. \u0026ldquo;We talked to two, Angara and her lover, Saya.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They speak English?\u0026rdquo; Mu Su exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;I never heard them talk English.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; Pat asked impatiently, \u0026ldquo;what happened?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You first,\u0026rdquo; Gail demanded. \u0026ldquo;You actually killed someone?\u0026rdquo; she finished with a hungry look in her eye.\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t kill anyone,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained, \u0026ldquo;they did,\u0026rdquo; indicating Mu Su and his pod with one hand and Phoebe and Xing with the other.\n\u0026ldquo;Xing!\u0026rdquo; Gail exclaimed, grabbing her newest sister-wife into a fierce hug, \u0026ldquo;you got one?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Xing said, \u0026ldquo;Cleo sting him; I hold him under.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re alright?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked anxiously, taking Xing from Gail\u0026rsquo;s embrace and examining her carefully, lifting her arms one at a time, spinning her torso around, looking like a camp councilor getting a young camper ready for a shower.\n\u0026ldquo;I fine, Mom,\u0026rdquo; Xing teased, giving her a kiss to soften the dig. \u0026ldquo;Pat say our venom make gentle death.\u0026rdquo;\nPhoebe brought everyone up to date on how their venom worked and how the men had drowned, what they did with the bodies, and the weapons that they had collected and others that they found in the backpack. The guns that had been used underwater would probably still work, but Gail stopped their story and their speculation for a \u0026ldquo;land battle\u0026rdquo; that Mu Su seemed to be hoping for as he showed off the nine millimeter.\n\u0026ldquo;We have a better idea,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Tomorrow night will be a luau on the beach, and Angara and Saya will help us plan for a very special evening.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure we can trust them?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I trust them,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said. \u0026ldquo;They never harmed us, and they sometimes seemed genuinely sorry for what was happening to us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s right,\u0026rdquo; Emma added. \u0026ldquo;I always felt they secretly resented Alberto, but did not have a way out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It was only because Alberto never said anything about their relationship that they even stayed with him,\u0026rdquo; Rikki explained. \u0026ldquo;Lesbians are not usually visible or welcome in Filipino culture.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We heard them talking about the luau earlier this morning,\u0026rdquo; John reported, giving Danni a smile. \u0026ldquo;So they are least telling the truth about that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, I know that smile,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe teased, \u0026ldquo;are you sure you two were concentrating on listening?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll have yours shortly, you minx!\u0026rdquo; John promised. \u0026ldquo;Now, what\u0026rsquo;s the plan?\u0026rdquo;\nWell, at least these three deaths were explainable, Alberto thought as he and his men picked through the remains of two of his men that had washed ashore along one of the small beaches that dotted the eastern side of the island. The sharks had ripped off most of their limbs and tore large chunks from their torsos. Only one of his men was still recognizable, but it was enough.\nWhy had they been stupid enough to go down to the water, he wondered. They were supposed to be gathering fruit, nuts, and small game for the luau tomorrow. He stood on the beach for a few minutes, the afternoon sun behind him, scanning the horizon. He was down to eleven men, and his cousin and her lover. Well, it was fewer to feed, and there was only one person he was worried about getting off this island. Himself. He ordered his men to leave the bodies to rot on the beach, and headed back into the jungle.\nMaybe they should dive down to the boats and see if any of the equipment could be salvaged. They had seen no new activity in the lagoon, found no evidence of anyone else living on the island, and he now new that the sharks were over here on the eastern shore. Yes, after they had the luau, they would reclaim the beach huts and begin plans to get off this godforsaken chunk of lava.\nTwenty-four hours later, twelve merfolk huddled together in the large sand bowl in the middle of the lagoon, several hundred yards from the beach. They had worked hard all day, starting by meeting with Angara early in the morning, before sunrise, to help her with a special recipe for the evening\u0026rsquo;s meal, and then spent the morning herding fish towards the men\u0026rsquo;s fishing tackle so that the lagoon would be especially bountiful. Now, all they could do was wait.\nNow, as the sun began its journey towards the far western horizon, they knew it had worked. The men were laughing, playing in the surf, and feeling like the curse that had laid over them was finally being lifted. Angara and Saya had outdone themselves, preparing a feast of seafood, fruits, berries, and even some left over canned goods from their stores from the boats. No one noticed anything different about the fruit punch because it was the first time that they had ever made any. If they had made some earlier, they might have noticed a slight metallic taste to this batch, the result of the addition of a touch of mermaid venom.\nNo, they just assumed it was the quality of the still, or how long it had been since they were drunk. They drank it all down, without noticing anything. As the sun neared the horizon, everyone was settling down in the huts, fat, full, and inebriated. Soon, however, the whisper dose of venom that Angara had added to the breadfruit and to the punch began to work on their bodies. Soon they were all asleep, even more than asleep, because when Saya fired three times into the sky, no one moved.\nWell, the last shot she fired wasn\u0026rsquo;t into the sky, and Angara couldn\u0026rsquo;t blame her when it blasted through one of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men instead, the one who had beaten and raped her a few months ago, before Alberto put a stop to it because he wanted his own meals cooked and prepared by women who could still hold pots. After all, Saya, who was a forty-three year-old virgin until that awful moment, deserved to get her revenge. She was only a little bit sorry that he was asleep when she shot him, but only a little.\nAs the merfolk emerged from the water, Angara then enjoyed watching Saya as she saw all three pods for the first time, not just Gail\u0026rsquo;s beautiful face and shoulders in the water. Angara had been surprised when all twelve merfolk ambled up onto her beach in the early morning light, but she was pretty sure Saya didn\u0026rsquo;t quite understand who their new allies actually were. Saya\u0026rsquo;s reaction had proven that she was right, as she was stunned. But she quickly recovered and told Angara that she had never seen anything more beautiful in her life. Together, humans and merfolk, they worked quickly, and soon the remaining eleven men were bound and tied on the beach.\n\u0026ldquo;They no muerto?,\u0026rdquo; asked Angara in her broken Spanglish.\n\u0026ldquo;No, they\u0026rsquo;re just unconscious,\u0026rdquo; Pat reported, checking on one of the men. \u0026ldquo;We didn\u0026rsquo;t give them enough to make their hearts stop beating. We would have to give each of them two full strikes directly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They be muerto pronto,\u0026rdquo; Angara stated, smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure you want all of them dead?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Si, dead,\u0026rdquo; Saya agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Angara, did you explain to her how our numbers worked?\u0026rdquo; asked Petra.\n\u0026ldquo;No, Siento,\u0026rdquo; she apologized.\nPat had them sit down next to her on the beach as she carefully went through each pod, explaining how each of them had come to be. As she pointed to the colorful pods who had gathered into their family units, Angara translated for Saya, who\u0026rsquo;s English was not very good. As their understanding grew, the eyes of the two women grew wide with amazement. When Pat explained how the mermaids had very high social needs, and that if there were no men in a pod, one of them would probably change into a male, the two women broke into feverish Spanish. After a few moments, they seemed to have reached an agreement.\n\u0026ldquo;Me hago un hombre?\u0026rdquo; Saya stated.\nAngara explained that Saya could never accept the attention of a male, but that she would be willing to become one to keep her lover as her mate.\n\u0026ldquo;You want to become the man?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat carefully, pointing to John for reference.\n\u0026ldquo;¿Sí, quiero hacerme como él?\u0026rdquo; Saya corrected, pointing at Michael and Mu Su.\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, seeing that Saya really did understand how those mermen had come to be-both former girls-like she would become.\n\u0026ldquo;Is there anyone here who you would consider making a female member of your new pod?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked. \u0026ldquo;Just the two of you might be difficult, and three or even four of you would be better.\u0026rdquo;\nThe two women broke into more Spanish, and after a few moments, Angara walked over to one of the younger members of the gang, and rolled him over onto his back. He was a Filipino male, about twenty-five years old. Lakan, was his name, Angara explained, and he was just a kid who got recruited by Alberto some years back, and he never seemed to have the taste for cruelty that most of the others did. No others, however, would even be considered. They were animals \u0026hellip; worse than animals, because they tortured their own for mere pleasure.\nWith that settled, the former victims of Alberto and his gang, except for Danni, took the remaining gang members unconscious bodies down to the water for an evening swim, except for Alberto and Lakan. The men helped the women drag the bodies to the water, and then each mermaid and merman took an unconscious man into the surf. An hour later, Pat, Danni, and John watched as everyone else returned to the lagoon, empty handed. No one said a word, but there was a fierce satisfaction in everyone\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\nEveryone returned to the fire Saya had kept going, and waited for Alberto and Lakan to wake up.\nHis head was pounding, his ears were ringing, and he was vaguely conscious of his hands being tied behind his back. He blinked, and thought he saw a fire, but surrounding the fire were thousands of jewels, sparkling with color and inner light. He struggled towards consciousness, and soon he was able to focus his eyes. At first, he was tempted to sit up in shock, but he had made it this far in a dangerous life by being careful, so he didn\u0026rsquo;t stir. It took inhuman effort to do so, but he kept his eyes to mere slits as he took in the unbelievable sight before him.\nThere, assembled around the fire, were mermaids and mermen! He counted his breaths and pushed his limbs against the cords so he could feel the bindings cut into him, causing pain to course up his arms and legs. Yes, he was awake, and yes, those were mermaids. That blonde one, with the blue scales and webs sitting next to the steel-gray merman, yes, she was the one in the water a few weeks ago, and he must have been the shark. Alberto cursed himself for not having seen through that charade, even as he still tried to absorb the existence of creatures out of myth and fantasy.\nNone of his men were visible, but his cousin and her ugly lover were sitting among the mermaids, chatting and listening as the group talked. He could see the two Henderson girls, and he thought he recognized that Australian brat, but where was her uncle? And there was a third Henderson girl! What? He tried to figure out who all these people/mermaids were, and he only grew more confused. How had they come here, how did the Henderson girls go from two to three? And there was one of the Chinese girls, Shou something, but where was that bitch, Mai Lin?\nAs he listened to their conversations, trying to figure out who was who and what was what, Alberto slowly realized that everyone was talking about the people in their lives that he or his men had killed, and that he had woken up as they were mourning the loss of loved ones. This was not a good time to let them know that he was now awake, and he had no illusions as to what they had planned for him. He felt with his arms for the small hard bump sewn into the rear of his pants, and when his wrists found the hard edge of his hidden derringer, he almost cried with relief. He didn\u0026rsquo;t know where his men were, but he suspected that they were all dead.\nNo, wait. He could see young Lakan lying near Angara. Perhaps not all was lost. If he could survive this crisis, then he could see about getting rescued before his own boss tracked him down. The thought of explaining all this to his boss, Malaki, a man even more ruthless than he was, made his blood run cold. Without his boats, his records, and his passwords, Alberto\u0026rsquo;s own skimming would become visible, and Malaki would kill him for the millions he had kept for himself. First, he had to survive, and to that end, he silently worked on the ropes around his wrists.\n\u0026ldquo;And so, I will miss them always,\u0026rdquo; Emma sobbed, \u0026ldquo;but even more so because they will never know how happy I am now.\u0026rdquo;\nRikki and Cleo leaned into their sister as Mu Su gathered his strong arms around all three of them. He held them all quietly, the rest of the pods watching in respectful silence, as the three girls finally mourned their parents. No one said anything more, but just listened to the fire\u0026rsquo;s crackle and the girls' quiet sobs.\nIt had been a long evening. The evening stars had come out, and the moon was full and bright over the eastern arm of the lagoon. The mermaids could all see quite clearly, their eyes adjusting to the darkness automatically. Gail looked with brittle hatred in her eyes at Alberto where he lay. Suddenly, she noticed that his eyes were actually alert and open behind the carefully held slits to which he had held himself.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s awake,\u0026rdquo; she said rising, and going around Michael to reach the recumbent captive.\nSeveral things happened at once, and the moonlight illuminated everything \u0026hellip; every detail \u0026hellip; with an eerie clarity that no one there would ever forget. Alberto pulled one hand from behind his back and pointed a small, shiny weapon at Gail. But Gail didn\u0026rsquo;t back off, and kept coming.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve already shot me twice, you sonofabitch,\u0026rdquo; she snarled, \u0026ldquo;go ahead and try it again.\u0026rdquo;\nAs she started for him, Michael saw the determination in Alberto\u0026rsquo;s eyes and sprang from his spot beside the fire, lifting his entire body into the air, hurtling towards Gail. At the same moment, John launched himself towards Alberto, arcing over the fire in an impossible display of athleticism. Mu Su tossed aside his girls and launched himself into the air, equally intent on destroying this insect of a man.\nIn the milliseconds that followed, time seemed to slow down to a crawl. Pat, Danni, and Phoebe screamed in horror as they saw their mate sail towards Alberto\u0026rsquo;s loaded gun. Petra and Xing were frozen in terror as they saw Gail charging even as Michael\u0026rsquo;s leap propelled him forward. The triplets screamed as they rose from the sand where Mu Su had thrown them and watched as his yellow and black stripes flashed in the firelight headed straight for danger. Alberto saw three mermen flying towards him, and Gail charging him on the ground. She was closest. He aimed at her chest and fired.\nBefore he could aim at a second target, John\u0026rsquo;s barb was in his chest, his body slamming into his, and he before his head hit the sand, he could feel his body going numb. He felt a second sting as Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s barb punctured his thigh, and Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s carefully placed elbow thumped on his chest. That hurt, despite the growing numbness.\nMichael\u0026rsquo;s leap had carried him forward, catching Gail\u0026rsquo;s low charge, and dragging her out of harm\u0026rsquo;s way, but as he twisted in the air, protecting his mate, the tiny bullet pierced his spine, ricocheted off his vertebrae, and splintered into his lungs. The pain was excruciating, and he knew he was paralyzed. Worse, he could feel his lungs fill up with blood.\nGail felt Michael go limp as they hit the sand together. And by the time the other mermaids had rushed over to them, she was holding Michael in her arms. She could feel Petra and Xing rush to her side, and she felt a slick warmth oozing between her webbed fingers as she cradled his dorsal ridge.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Michael,\u0026rdquo; she whispered, \u0026ldquo;what have I done?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Gail,\u0026rdquo; he struggled, coughing up blood. \u0026ldquo;You are my warrior, my sister, (cough) \u0026hellip; my lover \u0026hellip; never forget.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Quick take my milk,\u0026rdquo; urged Petra frantically.\n\u0026ldquo;No, love,\u0026rdquo; Michael whispered, \u0026ldquo;No time \u0026hellip; this \u0026hellip; more important.\u0026rdquo; His body was wracked with spasms and he coughed up more blood. \u0026ldquo;I will \u0026hellip; always \u0026hellip; be with you \u0026hellip; all\u0026rdquo; he whispered, \u0026ldquo;Petra is pregnant, and you,\u0026rdquo; he held Gail in a fierce gaze,\u0026rdquo; and you \u0026hellip; must be \u0026hellip; be \u0026hellip; the fadthurrrrrrrr.\u0026rdquo; Micheal\u0026rsquo;s eyes fluttered, and then relaxed into an sightless gaze at the stars.\nThe moment seemed to hang in the air, the sky and stars frozen in place. Even the sea was silent. No one breathed.\n\u0026ldquo;Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\u0026rdquo; Gail\u0026rsquo;s cry pierced the night, ripped from her chest like a rusty knife. Petra and Xing collapsed on their pod-mate, also wailing, while the rest held their breath in stunned silence.\nMany moments passed in mute agony and horror.\nThen, Gail slowly laid down her lover\u0026rsquo;s head, now lifeless, and fixed his hair. She had an eerie calm about her. She turned to her wailing sister-wives, and lifted up their chins. She held their eyes, and they choked back their sobs, strengthened by the force of Gail\u0026rsquo;s will, and together they salamandered slowly and deliberately over to where Alberto lay. John and Mu Su backed away slowly as the three mermaids approached, death in their eyes.\nAlberto lay conscious but unmoving as he saw the three faces loom over his. If he had been able to move, he would have cowered. As it was, his eyes shone bright with fear.\n\u0026ldquo;Yours will not be a gentle death,\u0026rdquo; Gail said with unnatural calmness.\n\u0026ldquo;Gail,\u0026rdquo; Pat began.\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; Gail, Petra, and Xing said together.\n\u0026ldquo;Then here,\u0026rdquo; Pat said as she held out a knife to Gail.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I won\u0026rsquo;t need that,\u0026rdquo; Gail said in her surreal, calm way, and ripped Alberto\u0026rsquo;s pants off his unmoving body with a single pull.\nA mermaid\u0026rsquo;s fingernails are surprisingly strong, thought Phoebe as she looked at her own hands as she scoped up the last handful of redstained sand and dropped it into the bucket she had for this purpose. It had taken everyone but Gail, Petra, and Xing the better part of the morning to clean up the mess that Alberto\u0026rsquo;s death had caused. The other pods had watched in horror and understanding as the three grieving pod-mates vented their outrage and vengeance upon the immobile man. It had only taken a few minutes, but Alberto had remained conscious right up to the point when Gail\u0026rsquo;s barbs on her flukes had pierced his skull, slamming down through his eyes as his blood spilled from the stumps of his limbs which had been ripped off with inhuman strength. When they were done, the three exhausted widow-mermaids had dragged the Alberto\u0026rsquo;s pieces into the sea. They wouldn\u0026rsquo;t let anyone else help with their grizzly task.\nPhoebe dumped the bucket into the surf, letting the ocean wash away the blood. She looked around at the beach, checking for any further signs of last night\u0026rsquo;s deadly business. She only saw the signs of where each of the two remaining pods had spent the previous evening. It was the first night most of them had spent on dry land for many weeks, and Phoebe was surprised at how comfortable the sand had been, sitting with her pod mates, entwined together in grateful acknowledgement that fate had spared them.\nGail and the others had returned about an hour after they left with Alberto\u0026rsquo;s remains, and they picked up Michael\u0026rsquo;s body. Pat had offered to help, but all three mermaids had simply shaken their heads in silence, and gathered their mate into their arms and returned to the sea. Phoebe had nearly stopped them to ask if they could examine Michael\u0026rsquo;s body, but Pat stopped her.\n\u0026ldquo;This is not a time for science,\u0026rdquo; Pat whispered as the three widowmermaids disappeared into the water.\nBoth John\u0026rsquo;s and Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s pods had stayed upright on the sand, in a mute salute as the three mermaids struggled with their burden, and they remained there, frozen in their vigil, hours later as the sun came up. No one moved, no one spoke, no one slept, not even Angara and Saya, until Lakan had stirred awake after the sun had lifted itself ten degrees off the horizon.\nAfter Lakan was fully awake, Pat, with Angara translating, explained what his options were, and while he was not looking forward to becoming a woman, or a mermaid, he seemed grateful for the chance to live. He asked who the three missing mermaids were, having never met them, but Angara assured him that \u0026ldquo;he\u0026rdquo; would never meet them, but \u0026ldquo;she\u0026rdquo; would.\nThree days later, they finally returned.\nOne day before that return, seven mermaids and three mermen floated in the Moon Pool while Lakan sat fearfully in the cave, waiting for his turn. They had started with Saka two days ago, who became Agba in about twelve hours; his new Filipino name meant \u0026ldquo;courage.\u0026rdquo; Afterwards Angara had made her transition in about ten hours. Now it was his turn. He already had immature gills on his back thanks to the feedings they had given him. He had enjoyed those despite knowing what they were doing to him. Danni\u0026rsquo;s breasts were his favorite, with her classic blonde looks, long nipples, and supple body. He had to be restrained for this morning\u0026rsquo;s feeding because he kept pawing at her body, determined to enjoy his last hours as a man.\nAgba rose up as soon as Angara had finished changing. He was a small merman compared to John or Mu Su, but he was large for a Filipino man, over seven feet in length with an impressive silver and black-stripped tail. He had regressed in age as he changed, and appeared to be a healthy man, well \u0026hellip; merman, in his early twenties. He had broad shoulders and a strong jaw. His hair was black as were his eyes, and the look he gave Lakan brokered no negotiations. Lakan merely sighed as he slipped reluctantly into the pool.\nHe discovered himself facing Angara, who had equally regressed in age, and was beautiful, more beautiful than he could have possible imagined. She had radically changed and was lovely in her shimmering silver-white tail with a whisper of pink along her fins, flukes, and webbing. Her hair was also white, and her eyes were blue, a striking combination. Like Agba, she was small, about the same size as Xing, but she had lovely breasts and a tiny waist. Her dorsal membrane looked like finest lace as it fluttered in the water behind her. She was finishing a squid, as everyone was eating after her transition in the pool, rather than above in the cave. She swallowed the last of her meal, and he gulped as she reached out her arms for him.\nThe entire group intoned, \u0026ldquo;Liga take from Angara her milk and receive from her your tail.\u0026rdquo; Liga was to be his new name, which meant \u0026ldquo;light,\u0026rdquo; and they were speaking because they knew he would refuse. Even as he felt Angara\u0026rsquo;s arms cradle his head to her breast, and even as his lips began drinking from her, he still felt a great turmoil inside; he would not will this to happen. They would have to force him.\nPat had known Lakan would go down fighting, and so when Angara had finished, before Agba had risen to fetch him, she had coached everyone on what to do. They would will him to change. Agba wanted Liga to become a black mermaid to Angara\u0026rsquo;s white, and everyone agreed on what Liga would look like, and more importantly, how the future mermaid should behave. She would be a devoted mate to Agba and sister-wife to Angara. Pat also enjoyed the pun buried in Lakan\u0026rsquo;s new name, he would be black in color, but light hearted in nature-if this experiment worked.\nLakan felt the energy build slightly from Angara\u0026rsquo;s milk, and he struggled as Angara guided him towards Pat. He could hear them all humming.\n\u0026ldquo;Liga, take from Pat her milk and receive from her your tail,\u0026rdquo; they all chanted.\nPat took the reluctant man to her breast, and he could not stop himself from suckling at her large nipples. Pat focused her mind, even as she felt the customary pleasure \u0026gt;from a feeding flow through her body, on feminine thoughts, and reveling in the feelings of a female body, the wonder of erogenous zones that encompass whole areas of a body, rather than centered in a penis. She felt the milk flow from her breasts, and thought of the joy she felt when she finally accepted her journey into womanhood. She switched breasts, and renewed her focus on Liga becoming a beautiful mermaid, deeply bonded to Agba and Angara. She could feel his resistance, but it faded some as she focused her will upon him. When he had drained her breasts, she pushed him to Danni.\nLakan could feel the forces building, and he was trying to fight them. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop himself from drinking, however, and he knew that each drop was pushing him further and further away from manhood and deeper and deeper into a new world that he feared. He could not shut out their humming, their energy, or their will.\n\u0026ldquo;Liga, take from Danni her milk and receive from her your tail,\u0026rdquo; they repeated.\nLakan was almost eager to return to Danni\u0026rsquo;s wonderful breasts, but he did not reach for her. Instead, she gathered him into her arms, and guided his trembling lips to her nipples. She too focused on the great joy she had discovered when she changed from man to woman, and then again from woman to mermaid. She poured those thoughts into the milk that flowed from her breasts into the slender man she held.\nLakan could feel his body growing rigid, his legs stiffening towards the bottom of the pool. How could that be, he wondered. They told him he would first become a woman and then become a mermaid. He fought against the forces that seemed to be both within his body and surrounding him in the water, pressing in on him from all sides, but his body would not respond to his own will. He could feel pressure at his waist and shoulders pushing in, and pressure at his hips pushing out. Even as he reluctantly continued to drink from Danni\u0026rsquo;s breasts, his body began its journey towards womanhood.\n\u0026ldquo;Liga, take from John his semen and receive from him your tail,\u0026rdquo; the group chanted as they pushed him towards the enormous merman, whose equally large cock stood stiff in the water, pointed at his face.\nLakan turned away, but Danni and Pat held his arms and Angara held his legs, and moved him towards John\u0026rsquo;s body. He turned his head from side to side, but that only succeeded in making John\u0026rsquo;s penis slap his face and brush against his lips. A drop of pre-cum caught his lips on his second pass, and the taste froze him in the water. Pat reached up and opened his mouth with her fingers as John slowly inserted his cock into the reluctant transformee\u0026rsquo;s mouth. As soon as John\u0026rsquo;s cock reached the back of his throat, a great spurt of semen gushed forth, and Lakan\u0026rsquo;s gag reflex took over, and he swallowed down the load. Another spurt followed, and Lakan took that one down, and another, and another. Finally, the mermaids stopped holding him, and he floated free from John\u0026rsquo;s cock, horrified at what was happening to him.\n\u0026ldquo;Liga, take from Rikki her milk and receive from her your tail,\u0026rdquo; the group repeated as Angara, still holding Lakan\u0026rsquo;s legs, moved him to her. Rikki took the now trance-like Lakan to her lips, noting that he was already well on his way to womanhood. His slender torso had become more so, and his hips had widened considerably. His hair was longer, and his face was softer. His hands and shoulders were dramatically smaller, and his eyes were larger. He drank from her deeply.\n\u0026ldquo;Liga, take from Cleo her milk, and receive from her your tail,\u0026rdquo; they said. He wanted to turn away, but he could not. He drank from Cleo\u0026rsquo;s breasts, no different from Rikki\u0026rsquo;s, and felt his manhood slip further and further away. He was now mostly a woman, he could tell. But they would never get his mind, he vowed.\n\u0026ldquo;Liga, take from Emma her milk, and receive from her your tail,\u0026rdquo; they chanted and then resumed their humming. There was something different about Emma\u0026rsquo;s breasts, and he found himself sucked into an energy he had not felt before. Emma focused her mind clearly on her own very recent journey into womanhood, and thrilled to the incredible feelings that washed over her as she was a feeder for the first time. She poured her love of all things girlish into her milk, into Lakan, and she pressed her whole body into his increasingly female body. Pat had joined Angara at Lakan\u0026rsquo;s legs, and his body was now visibly feminine.\n\u0026ldquo;You love breasts, don\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo; Emma whispered to the increasingly feminine Lakan who nodded wordlessly into her breast, still sucking at her nipple. \u0026ldquo;Come on Liga, let me see your breasts,\u0026rdquo; she urged. \u0026ldquo;Push out, you can do it, nice breasts with pert sensitive nipples. You want breasts, you know you do.\u0026rdquo;\nLiga couldn\u0026rsquo;t help it. She did want breasts, and so she pushed. It felt incredible; her breasts slowly rose on her chest even as she switched to Emma\u0026rsquo;s other breast. She could feel her nipples expand into the water, crinkling up with tension as they grew, a delicious itching deep within her chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Liga, take from Mu Su his semen and take from him your tail,\u0026rdquo; they chanted again. Liga could feel her legs stiffening further as Pat and Angara rubbed her long, slender limbs, so soft and feminine. She reached forward with her own hand, and guided Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s cock to her mouth, and swallowed each spurt as it flowed into her body. The energy was really building now, and she could feel with swirling forces within and without her body.\n\u0026ldquo;Liga, take from Agba his semen and take from him your tail,\u0026rdquo; they sang a final time.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Agba \u0026hellip; give me my tail,\u0026rdquo; Liga gasped, filled with sudden need and barely able to contain herself.\nShe fell on to Agba\u0026rsquo;s cock and pulled deeply on it. She was instantly rewarded with hot rush of semen that gushed into her mouth. Another, and another, and another! She sucked harder, and was rewarded with another, and yet another. Agba arched in his orgasm, and focused on Liga\u0026rsquo;s journey towards his future pod-mate.\nLiga pulled back as Pat and Angara floated away from her legs. Her arms seemed to be pulled by a force outside herself, stretching out horizontally in the water, her head erect, her toes rigidly pointed towards the bottom of the pool. She could feel her dramatically changed body in the water, the cool caress of water on her neck, her breasts, her tummy, her hips, her crotch, and her rigid legs. She hung there for all time and no time at all. The water she could feel lapping at her crotch, caressing her thighs, began to feel warm, and she pushed down on her crotch with her stomach muscles, clenching her back as well in her effort to push down her crotch.\nThe others watched as Liga moaned into the water, her body pulsing with energy, as the familiar slow-motion spasm rolled through her body. They were all humming in unison, watching her slowly transform into a beautiful mermaid. Her legs fused, and then her tail lengthened. Her flukes then appeared, and then her fins and dorsal membrane, and finally her webbing and her final growth of hair signified that the two and one half days were nearly finished.\nLiga could not feel time pass, but she felt a growing urge rise within her. She pushed hard, her whole body caught up in the incredible effort, and felt her tail reach for the bottom of the pool. She could feel the strange and painful sensation of her bones breaking, reforming, and knitting themselves back together. Even as she recovered from that ordeal, she could feel her flukes push out from her tail, and then her fins at her sides. Long, sinewy muscles formed and attached themselves to her pelvis, torso, and tail. She could feel her tail forming scales, crawling down from her waist, cascading over her flanks, and spreading out over her flukes. Waves of energy crashed up and down her body, reshaping and reforming her into a petite, lovely mermaid.\nThen a great bubble of energy rose up from her new womb and percolated through her body, rising finally through her head and scalp. She arched her body in a spasm of ecstasy, and when she opened her eyes, she could see her beautiful tailfin fluttering in the afternoon sunlight that filtered down into the Moon Pool.\nShe straightened out, and looked down at herself. She was beautiful. She had velvet black scales with hints of purple and blue shimmering below the surface, and her fins, flukes, and webbing were trimmed with a delicate white lace. She turned and admired the sweep of her hips out from her waist, and the long fluttering white of her dorsal membrane.\nShe turned to see Agba and Angara floating before her, and a deep feeling of love and lust welled up from within her. She darted forward in the water, and the three of them were quickly caught in a swirling tangle of fins, tails, and arms. Never before had she felt such need, and she begged Agba to fulfill her need, uncaring of the other pods still in the pool. She remembered her past, but now it seemed distasteful, and the wondrous gift of a new life, a fresh start, with a supple and beautiful body was not to be denied.\nNothing had ever felt like this need, and Liga reached down to Agba\u0026rsquo;s already stiff cock, and pointed it at her virgin opening. She turned to Angara and kissed her deeply as she felt Agba begin to push slowly into her, his penis pushing past her outer lips, silky soft even as they stretched in a wonderful tension around his invading cock. She felt his head glide past her birth canal, sliding up and in, steadily pushing relentlessly forward. She could feel the veins along the outside of his cock as it pushed into her now willing and eager body. Her virginity gave way with barely a ripple, and still his cock pushed inwards.\nAs his hips met her own, Liga could feel the full length and strength of her husband-pod-mate\u0026rsquo;s cock. His tail was pushed into her own, her labia stretched taught around his thick cock, her clitoris throbbing as his top ridge on his vent poked at it. He slowly pulled his cock back out, pausing at the top of his stroke, holding just the tip of his cock inside her hot and eager pussy.\nThen Agba began to stroke in and out of her vagina, his hands at her hips, drawing him into her again and again. She didn\u0026rsquo;t notice as the other pods fell into their own groups, seeking the healing and sanctuary of their own mates. Liga only knew her pod-mates, Angara stroking and pinching her nipples, Agba\u0026rsquo;s cock sawing in and out of her new opening, and that fullness that stretched her insides in a pleasurably agonizing way. When she found her release, seconds later, she passed out in delirium.\nGail looked around her at the circle of mermaids floating in the Moon Pool, and she steeled herself to the task she knew she must do. Petra was pregnant, as everyone had discovered. Her electrical pattern had changed infinitesimally, and when they thought about it, they had agreed that she was now five days late on her period. Gail had been right, she acknowledged silently to herself, Petra was the first to conceive. Now, Gail must become the father.\nShe had spent the three days in mourning over the loss of their beloved Michael, but the urge to change had built up steadily from her two sister-wives. She recognized their need, and they had returned to the group to affect the quickest change possible, and surprisingly, she had been able to eat large amounts of food for the last few hours, and everyone had joined in the effort to fill her with the raw materials she would need for the change. As the sun set, and the moon rose over their chimney, she hoped that she was ready for her final transformation.\nShe floated to Xing, who was still trying to control her emotions, but was crying, despite her best efforts. Strange, Gail thought as she looked at the beautiful young Asian mermaid, you can still see tears underwater.\n\u0026ldquo;Xing, my beautiful flower of the sea,\u0026rdquo; she began, \u0026ldquo;will you give me your milk so that I can become your mate?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Gail,\u0026rdquo; Xing sobbed, \u0026ldquo;thank you much become Gabriel,\u0026rdquo; using the name Gail had decided to use. \u0026ldquo;Take me so you give me child.\u0026rdquo;\nGabriel, yes, Gabriel sounded good, she/he thought to himself as he/she heard it spoken for the first time. Gabriel floated forward and took the delicate Xing into his/her arms and kissed her first, then sank to her breast and began to drink. Gabriel drank deeply from her/his podmate, draining her, and then moved to Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;I must drink from you so that I may join John as a male,\u0026rdquo; she/he intoned, \u0026ldquo;will you help me become a man?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Come, Gabriel,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with great gentleness and admiration, \u0026ldquo;drink from me.\u0026rdquo;\nGabriel could feel the great power in Pat\u0026rsquo;s breasts begin to build the energy she/he would need to make the transition, but she/he held it in check. Gabriel then drank from Danni, Phoebe, Angara, Liga, and then the triplets, each time building power but each time holding those forces in check with her/his indomitable will.\nFinally, filled with the energy of the mermaids, and feeling the distant masculine energy of John, Mu Su, and Agba as they waited above, Gabriel/Gail faced Petra, unchanged other than the tremendous energy that she/he held within his/her body.\n\u0026ldquo;I am \u0026hellip; unchanged \u0026hellip; until I come to you \u0026hellip; my love,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel struggled to get the words out in Gail\u0026rsquo;s still unchanged voice. \u0026ldquo;You were my \u0026hellip; first \u0026hellip; true \u0026hellip; love, and so you will \u0026hellip; remain \u0026hellip; forever. Let me drink from you \u0026hellip; and become \u0026hellip; the man of your dreams.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Gabriel,\u0026rdquo; Petra gasped, touched by the gesture and the effort that Gail was exerting to hold back those forces she could see surging within her/his body. \u0026ldquo;Drink from me my love, and be ours,\u0026rdquo; she said as she looked at the still crying Xing. As Gabriel drifted towards one of Petra\u0026rsquo;s generous breasts, Petra pulled Xing to her other breast. \u0026ldquo;Drink too, my love,\u0026rdquo; she whispered to Xing, \u0026ldquo;drink and be healed.\u0026rdquo;\nGabriel and Xing made contact with Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts at the same moment, and both women arched into enormous orgasms. Xing drank the warmth and sweetness the poured from Petra as she felt the energy that Gabriel had stored and was now releasing throughout his body.\nGabriel could sense the crystal clear image in Petra\u0026rsquo;s mind, and he liberated the forces that swirled within him. He felt his body push outward in all directions throughout his body as his change converted the bulk and food he had stuffed himself with into more bone, muscle, and sinew. He felt his shoulders stretch out, and his arms lengthen, even as his tail grew longer and stronger, and a dorsal fin pushed outward from his backside. Without stopping his efforts at pulling the transformative milk from Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts, he pushed hard with his abdomen, and he felt his womb fall deep within his tail, tingling and transforming. After a few moments, he felt a new force rising up through his tail, poking out his now changed vent, and then rising into the water. He could feel his new cock, stiff and hot in the cool water, throbbing with need. But still he pulled from Petra\u0026rsquo;s breast.\nThe rest of the mermaids watched in wonder as Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s tail darkened to the same obsidian black with silver highlights that Michael had once had, and how Gail\u0026rsquo;s stark beauty was changed into a subtle reflection of Michael\u0026rsquo;s rugged good looks. His hair didn\u0026rsquo;t change, but Pat suspected that it would eventually slough off and become shorter like John\u0026rsquo;s and Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s. His eyes, however, were still the vibrant, dark, violet eyes of Gail, darkened now by grief and effort. Gabriel also looked a little gaunt as he finished his change, probably because of the need for his body to add more bulk to the larger bones and muscles he had just created.\nGabriel\u0026rsquo;s change had taken only a few minutes, but for Gabriel it seemed only a few seconds. Now he floated with his two pod mates while John\u0026rsquo;s, Mu Su\u0026rsquo;s, and Agba\u0026rsquo;s pods each found release in their own corners of the Moon Pool. He was now nearly as tall as John, and he looked at the lush, womanly Petra with great love and great sadness.\n\u0026ldquo;He knew before you did,\u0026rdquo; he whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I didn\u0026rsquo;t know that I was pregnant,\u0026rdquo; Petra wondered.\n\u0026ldquo;It because you not born woman,\u0026rdquo; Xing said. \u0026ldquo;You have few periods. You no could know,\u0026rdquo; she said as she rested her hand on Petra\u0026rsquo;s belly.\n\u0026ldquo;Her name will be \u0026hellip; Michelle,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, holding Xing\u0026rsquo;s hand on her belly while reaching out to bring Gabriel into a kiss. Xing stroked Petra\u0026rsquo;s hair as Gabriel kissed Petra. Petra\u0026rsquo;s kisses became more urgent, and she began pulling at Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s body, pushing herself to him.\n\u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we be careful with the baby,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel worried.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Petra panted into his ear, \u0026ldquo;this is more important.\u0026rdquo;\nGabriel\u0026rsquo;s heart wrenched as he heard Michael\u0026rsquo;s last words repeated, but he understood what Petra meant. And she was right, this was more important. He gave himself over to the rising blood in his cock, pulled his vent open, and let his new mast rise in the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Gabriel,\u0026rdquo; Petra moaned as she felt his cock brush against her belly, \u0026ldquo;I want you so badly.\u0026rdquo;\nXing helped guide his cock to Petra\u0026rsquo;s eager vent, and then wrapped her own tail around her pod-mates as they began to make love. Gabriel now understood why Michael had given himself so easily, so eagerly, and so often to Petra as he felt her welcoming warmth pull his long cock deep within her. He could feel her muscles rippling along his shaft, even as she cooed into his ear, nuzzling him, constantly urging him, \u0026ldquo;More, more, \u0026hellip; more,\u0026rdquo; in her soft, sweet voice. \u0026ldquo;Harder, harder, harder,\u0026rdquo; she continued, as his rhythms grew more and more urgent, their bodies slapping together. As Gail, her silence was cold, but as Gabriel his silence was masculine. Nevertheless, he had to tell her how he loved her.\n\u0026ldquo;Petra, oh \u0026hellip;. God \u0026hellip; Petra,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel moaned, as his body began to gather sperm deep within his tail, his stiffness reaching down to his mid-tail fins. He could feel Xing perched on his left shoulder, her breasts pressed into his torso as her clit was pressed to his pelvic fin. He could feel his right fin vibrating in the water, and their entwined tails all glittering with their need, shaking and twisting as they made love for the first time as male and female. \u0026ldquo;Petra \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip; love \u0026hellip; oh \u0026hellip; you,\u0026rdquo; he gasped as they pounded into each other.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Gabriel \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; love \u0026hellip; you \u0026hellip; too \u0026hellip; more \u0026hellip; more \u0026hellip;. Again \u0026hellip; right there \u0026hellip; oooohhhh \u0026hellip; more \u0026hellip; my love, AAAAAHHHHHHHHH,\u0026rdquo; Petra murmured as softly as she could into Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s ear as she tried to stifle the volume of her orgasm that ripped through her lush and womanly body, her tail quivering in spasms, her body clenching around Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s stiff cock.\n\u0026ldquo;Arrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel groaned as his release came, pulsing up from deep within, locking their bodies together in a passionate embrace. As they both quivered in the free-fall tumble of their love, he reached for Petra\u0026rsquo;s beautiful face with his hands, their bodies still twitching, and kissed her deeply. He then turned and kissed Xing who was still coming down from her own orgasm, their bodies surrounded by the milk released from the girls.\n\u0026ldquo;Her name will be Michelle,\u0026rdquo; he whispered again. Both women nodded happily.\n07 - Sharks, Submarines, and Salvage The moonlight filtered down from the chimney hole, high above the pool. It glimmered on the surface of the pool that dominated the medium sized cavern at the bottom of the tall chimney room, sending soft sparkles of moonlight bouncing around the rocks and walls. Pat sat, breathing heavily, on the edge of the pool, finishing off a chuck of dried fish as she admired the flashing moonlight reflected from the gently churning pool from which she had just emerged.\nShe was hungry after her long swim today, the last trek of her two-week trip with John to explore and survey several of the many shipwrecks they had discovered within a few days swim of the island. The two of them had returned only moments ago, and Danni and Phoebe attacked John with a welcome that made it clear that John would be eating later-much later. Pat enjoyed one quick, magnificent, orgasm at John\u0026rsquo;s hip while Danni quivered on John\u0026rsquo;s cock, and Phoebe occupied John\u0026rsquo;s other hip. Now, herself temporarily sated, Pat enjoyed her brief solitude and her late-night meal.\nPat smiled with the recent memory of John\u0026rsquo;s feeble protestations that he was hungry as Phoebe pulled herself onto his still stiff cock. He was silenced by her feverish kisses as she pushed herself onto him. Pat looked at the sparkling surface of the pool, and saw that the entire pool was now clouded by wisps of white that swirled in every corner of the pool, and within denser clouds of white, she could see flashes of color and shapes. Danni and Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s passion had ignited the other pods, and everyone was making love.\nPat gazed up into the moonlight, feeling the cool light as it played along her delicate features, and watched as the gently roiling water cast shimmering reflections of the moon that darted across the high cavern ceiling. She listened to the sound of the water lapping along the edges of the pool and her own flukes as they trailed in the water. She felt her long red hair as it curled along her shoulders, cascaded down her back, and felt one thick lock that fell gently across her left breast. Her body was still quivering from her reunion orgasm, her breasts still tight with milk. She looked down at her body, feeling her own soft thick hair shift along her gills, shoulders, and breast. She gazed along her feminine shoulders and followed the swell of two large mounds that dramatically sloped away from her once male chest, ending at two small domed areolas at the ends of her large breasts, each tipped with a fat nipple that still leaked her mermaid\u0026rsquo;s milk. Even from this angle she thought her breasts were beautiful.\nShe flicked her stray lock of hair back over her shoulder and swung her shoulders in the sheer joy of being female, feeling her heavy breasts sway and tug at her chest. As her breasts slowly came to a rest, she continued her gaze down to where her flat stomach merged with her shimmering green tail, admiring the sweep of her waist inwards down from her breasts and than back out to the generous swell of her hips. She ran her free hand along her tiny waist, down to the joint between her human and mer halves, teasing herself along that line, tracing the slight texture differences that marked the joining. Her abdomen jerked and twitched, echoing her recent orgasm, as she caressed herself across her tummy. Her whole body felt alive with sensation, even her dorsal ridge that was pressed to the cave floor by her own weight quivered in delightful feelings.\nShe continued her gentle trickling of her fingertips down along her hips to her pelvic fins, which were really flippers-except that they looked just like her tailfin, shimmering green fins with strong bony ridges that could support her considerable weight, following one of the spines outward to the pink fringe that fluttered along the trailing edge. Her pelvic and mid-tail fins were shaped like traditional dolphin flippers (their pectoral fins), and they felt like little limbs. Pat didn\u0026rsquo;t know what they felt like when she compared her feelings now to her past human memories, both male and female memories. They felt like \u0026hellip; very short arms, she decided as she stroked the length of her pelvic fin. For the next several minutes, she savored the swells of pleasure that still pulsed through her feminine body, the muscles that joined her fins to her body/tail twitching and jumping as she continued her self-stimulation.\nVery pretty fins, she thought to herself as she caressed the dusting of pink along the edges, which was matched with similar pink fringes along her dorsal ridge and along the trailing edges of her flukes. Her fringes were all sensitive, and her fin-muscles quivered pleasantly from the sensations her self-caresses caused along the ends of her long, strong fins.\nShe again marveled at her own new anatomy. Not only was she now a female of the species, but also she was a whole new species. Her three sets of fins/flukes were incredibly tough for appendages that could still sense touch, temperature, and texture. Many times, she caught herself scrambling over rocks, along the sand on the beach, or over the cave floor, worried that her fins would prove fragile. The salamander gait the mers used on land was not nearly as beautiful as their swimming gaits, and Pat smiled as she thought how John always looked like he would damage himself as he launched himself over rocks, sand, scrub trees, and whatever else was in his way. Their fins weren\u0026rsquo;t fragile, however; pelvic, mid-tail, and flukes were all as tough as nails, seemingly impervious to the sharp coral, rough sand, or jagged rocks.\nAs Pat ran her hands back up along her stomach to her breasts, she thought about how all her skin and scales were durable, especially considering how soft they felt. Ah, the miracle of the Lotus Effect, she thought, remembering her (well, then his) college science courses. Millions of tiny nanostructures made her skin, scales, and even her hair hydrophobic, tough, and yet soft and sensitive to touch at the same time. Her breasts were especially sensitive, she thought to herself as she hefted one in her palm, cradling her heavy breast in her hand.\nShe marveled yet again at how soft her breasts were, enjoying the ripple of motion across her chest, her nipple stiff and tight in the evening air. She noticed that the milk that was leaking from her distended nipple was not behaving like water did. Her own milk clung to her breast, sliding down her areola, running through her fingers until small drops of milk fell onto her tail. She reached down to the pool, and dribbled some water across the top of her breasts, where it immediately formed little balls that quickly rolled down her cleavage, falling from the side of her round breasts, rather than from underneath, balling up once again when they hit her tail, and rolled off her body onto the cave floor, where it pooled as water normally did, though she could see a thin line of air between her scales and the water that had fallen off her when she rose from the pool. Her milk, however, slowly slid down her tail, and then oozed into the water, creating a wispy trail of white. Her milk was very different from human milk, she surmised, and had molecular properties that made it different than water, which never stayed on her skin or scales for very long. Even now, just moments after leaving the water, her hair that tumbled down her back was dry. Thank goodness they hadn\u0026rsquo;t ended up with a dolphin\u0026rsquo;s fragile skin, she thought to herself. The mix of the original fish goop, Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s rich imagination, and blind luck, apparently, had given them some incredible skills and advantages.\nShe decided to save that puzzle for another time, and finished the last of her fish. Pat twirled her flukes in the water as she caressed her breasts again, collecting the milk that still oozed from her nipple, and brought it up to her lips to cleanse her pallet. She shivered with pleasure as her hand grazed her swollen nipple, and she squirmed with renewed need as she thought of Danni, Phoebe, and John below, still swirling, still entwined together. She rather enjoyed the fact that not only was Danni and Phoebe frantic to see them again, but also that she was frantic to see her sister-wives too. It was good to be loved. She wondered if she or her sister wives would follow Petra in motherhood, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything she was going to rush into. They had all been having sex nearly constantly, but only Petra had become pregnant thus far. Pat wondered how that was possible.\nWell, there was only one way to find out. Pat grabbed another chuck of dried fish, and slipped back into the water. John would get his meal, but he would have to eat and work at the same time. Pat didn\u0026rsquo;t think that he would mind.\nThe next morning, everyone gathered at the beach by the lagoon after breakfast to hear Pat and John\u0026rsquo;s report.\n\u0026ldquo;We found lots of useful things,\u0026rdquo; Pat began, \u0026ldquo;most notably a relatively new Russian submarine down at about 300 meters that looks like it sunk recently. We think it is a two-day swim to reach the site, a little over 350 nautical miles to the wreck. There was a crack along the starboard side, which is probably why it sank. We opened the hatch, and there was neutral pressure. We didn\u0026rsquo;t explore much, but it looked like things were intact. The crack along the hull looked like metal fatigue, so we think the reactor is still safe, for now. Wait \u0026hellip; wait \u0026hellip; I know you\u0026rsquo;re all excited, just keep quiet for a sec, and let me finish.\u0026rdquo;\nShe looked around as everyone settled back down. Although Angara had stopped translating for Agba in the last two months as his skills in English improved, they were now speaking excitedly in Spanish. Angara\u0026rsquo;s white hair and tail sparkled in the morning sun, flashing as she gestured to Agba, her former lesbian lover now merman/pod mate. Agba had grown more and more comfortable in his role as a pod leader, and now matched MuSu in fighting skill. (MuSu had been teaching everyone a version of shaolin kungfu that he had adapting for mer-selfdefense.) Agba\u0026rsquo;s silver and black stripes served as the visual transition from Angara\u0026rsquo;s nearly pure white to Liga\u0026rsquo;s nearly pure black. Liga, who had gained some enhancement of her English as she went through her transformation from a male gang member into their newest mermaid, gave her pod mate a poke to get his attention. Agba turned, arched an eyebrow at Liga who jerked her head towards Pat. Agba smiled a small apology to Pat.\nPat\u0026rsquo;s gaze then turned to MuSu as she noted that both he and Xing had also improved their English skills quickly, so much that they were now practically native speakers. However, like Agba\u0026rsquo;s pod, when excited MuSu and Xing broke into Chinese, but that wasn\u0026rsquo;t a problem because everyone was learning Spanish and Chinese. And in the process, the mers had learned a great deal more about their own capabilities.\nAll the Mers had discovered that their enhanced mer-senses-their ability to sense the environment and the living organisms around them, their ability to recognize the electrical charges/identities not only of one another but also of all living things, their enhanced hearing and sight both on land and underwater-also seemed to help them learn from one another-new languages, swimming skills, martial arts, etc. Pod mates learned more quickly from one another, which explained why John and Agba\u0026rsquo;s pod could not speak Chinese as fluently as MuSu\u0026rsquo;s and Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s pods (Xing being a native Chinese speaker too), and why all the pods except Agba\u0026rsquo;s could only speak passable Spanish, Peter/Petra having only a modest command of Spanish before her transformation. Pat had nevertheless encouraged everyone to learn all their languages because they could never be sure who among them might make contact with the outside world, though they had all agreed to try and avoid any such contact until they were better prepared.\n\u0026ldquo;I know we have discussed this many times,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued, \u0026ldquo;but I want to say again that I am against harvesting any kind of weapons.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And we will repeat,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said evenly, his violet eyes flashing, \u0026ldquo;that we must have something to fall back on if we are threatened by humans. We cannot defend ourselves by hiding forever.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pat just needed to say that,\u0026rdquo; John interjected. \u0026ldquo;I know how you feel, Gabriel, and frankly I agree with you.\u0026rdquo; He shot Pat a loving smile, and continued. \u0026ldquo;When we worked for Greenpeace, we never carried weapons. But, we were just a pain in someone\u0026rsquo;s butt, not a challenge to their entire world view.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said firmly. \u0026ldquo;I hate to know this the way that I know this \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Everyone nodded, understanding that he was referring to his former life as a female missionary for a fundamentalist Christian religion. \u0026ldquo;But \u0026hellip; some people will make it their mission to destroy us, even though we don\u0026rsquo;t threaten them in any way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Other than forcing them to re-think everything they thought they knew about the world,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with resignation. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t disagree with you, I just can\u0026rsquo;t bring myself to have a weapon, other than the potentially non-lethal one in my tail.\u0026rdquo; It didn\u0026rsquo;t need saying, but everyone was acutely aware that among them all, only Pat could claim to never having killed anyone.\n\u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t make a big deal about it,\u0026rdquo; she continued, \u0026ldquo;but I hope we can find some peaceful way to make our debut into the rest of the world.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we\u0026rsquo;re not likely to be discovered soon,\u0026rdquo; Rikki offered. \u0026ldquo;You two were here for ages before any of us came along.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, that\u0026rsquo;s why we are pretty sure that someone else will be along shortly, because some of our friends know where John and I went, and that we had only planned on spending a year here \u0026hellip; maximum. It\u0026rsquo;s getting close to that now, and so some one will show up,\u0026rdquo; Pat finished.\n\u0026ldquo;If it is a friend,\u0026rdquo; John explained, \u0026ldquo;we should be o.k. Though I am sure our changes will surprise them,\u0026rdquo; he said with a smile to Pat. \u0026ldquo;Not only is Pat a girl now, but also we\u0026rsquo;re mers! However, if our first visitor isn\u0026rsquo;t a friend, like say Alberto\u0026rsquo;s boss-what\u0026rsquo;s his name \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; he looked at Emma.\n\u0026ldquo;Malaki,\u0026rdquo; she answered. Emma and her sisters had discovered where Alberto had hidden all his papers on the now destroyed yachts that lay at the bottom of their lagoon. With MuSu\u0026rsquo;s help, they had recovered not only extensive records of his operations but also a large stash of cash that they had carefully dried out in the various caves that riddled the western side of their island. With Agba\u0026rsquo;s pod helping to translate some of the documents, they had only finished going through all the papers just before Pat and John left on their expedition. In fact, the scope and reach of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s crime empire was a major factor that caused Pat and John to seek additional resources that they could use to protect themselves.\n\u0026ldquo;Probably not his real name,\u0026rdquo; Agba offered. \u0026ldquo;Malaki means \u0026ldquo;big,\u0026rdquo; and it could be his gang name, not his real one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Whatever his name, Alberto owed him some big money, which we now have most of, thanks to the triplets. He won\u0026rsquo;t let those millions vanish without a search,\u0026rdquo; John concluded.\n\u0026ldquo;MuSu helped too,\u0026rdquo; Cleo chimed in, snuggling next to her pod mate on the sand.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, but you girls discovered where the safe was, and it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing Emma is on our side. She would have made an excellent criminal,\u0026rdquo; Pat teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Between our enhanced hearing and our mer-senses, that safe didn\u0026rsquo;t stand a chance,\u0026rdquo; Emma said dismissively.\n\u0026ldquo;It still takes a keen mind to puzzle it out,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe praised her fellow young scientist. She and Emma were Pat\u0026rsquo;s best students, though Agba was also showing surprising aptitudes despite having been raised a female Filipino with little training and background in science. \u0026ldquo;So, what is the plan?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked, turning to Pat, her own sister-wife.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we think we should make an expedition to bring back as much of the equipment and supplies that we found as we can,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;All four pods?\u0026rdquo; asked Gabriel, looking at the still not yet visibly pregnant Petra.\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;First, it means that we can carry back more stuff, and second, we will probably be safer that way. With just Pat and I, many larger sharks got curious, more curious than I was comfortable with. Lastly, we can go at different paces, to test our limits and capabilities long before visitors force us to do things we cannot.\u0026rdquo;\nIt was because they were the youngest.\nAs part of the experiments that Pat, Phoebe, and now even their own Emma were always creating and doing, MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod had been \u0026ldquo;volunteered\u0026rdquo; to test the limits of their mer-physiology on this trip. Emma herself had volunteered them in \u0026ldquo;the name of science.\u0026rdquo; Only Cleo was really complaining. MuSu was always ready for anything, especially physical challenges, and Rikki would do anything if it were a dare. Cleo, however, was content to simply be a mermaid, and to not trouble herself with any of the details.\n\u0026ldquo;But Emma,\u0026rdquo; she whined, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t like to sweat.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re mers,\u0026rdquo; Emma chided. \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t sweat underwater. We use our dorsal ridge to radiate heat generated from within our bodies into the water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, whatever,\u0026rdquo; she continued. \u0026ldquo;But why ever must you always be poking at me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because you\u0026rsquo;re just like me, being my exact twin,\u0026rdquo; Emma patiently explained. \u0026ldquo;I am just trying to understand who we are and what we mers can do. Besides, if you don\u0026rsquo;t complain, I promise to let you have first dibs on MuSu after we get there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s my turn anyway,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said with a shy smile at their pod-mate.\n\u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s Emma\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; Rikki interjected.\nMuSu gathered Cleo into his arms and gave her a kiss that curled both their tails.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright,\u0026rdquo; she said breathlessly, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll stop complaining.\u0026rdquo;\nEmma was taking mental notes even as she watched the beauty of her sisters and MuSu as they sliced through the water. In return for not having to carry any supplies on the way to the sub, her pod was given the task of swimming as fast as possible for as long as they could. Everyone else would catch up once they were within sight of the Russian sub. After some experimentation, they discovered that if they swam in a diamond formation with MuSu at the front, two sisters with their heads just behind the tips of his outstretched pelvic fins, and the third sister at the rear of the diamond formation slightly below MuSu\u0026rsquo;s direct wake, the girls could all draft off of MuSu\u0026rsquo;s powerful strokes.\nEmma was currently at the back of the diamond, and they were all swimming hard, but she was not expending nearly as much effort as the rest of her pod, because she was drafting off of three vortexes. They also discovered that if they stretched their arms forward, they could leverage their entire bodies into each stroke and that their elbow fins helped stabilize and steer themselves with only the slightest adjustments. Further, if they cupped their hands, they created a bulb of sorts that improved their bodies' hydrodynamic properties, similar to how the big knob at the bow of big ships improves their speed and stability. For the girls, stretching their arms forward had the added benefit of lifting their breasts closer to their chests, making them somewhat more hydrodynamic. It was still thrilling for Emma to feel the water powerfully rushing past her freely swinging breasts.\nTheir pelvic fins were extended nearly ninety degrees out from their bodies, creating a large flat surface from which their powerful flukes leveraged each up and down stroke of their tails, which allowed their upper bodies to be more relaxed. The short, strong, frequent strokes that created and sustained this high speed were more difficult to keep up than the long, full body strokes they had been used to, but they had been swimming at top speed for over two hours, and while the effort was taking its toll, Emma didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like she needed to slow down yet.\nEmma compared her view of MuSu\u0026rsquo;s flashing yellow and black tail with her sisters' blue and white tails. She was surprised by the clear differences between the male and the female stroke. MuSu\u0026rsquo;s shoulders were square to water, his arms forming a powerful V shaped bow. His strong back was visible to her on each down stroke, his dorsal fin fully extended upward, but his head and shoulders stayed at a constant attitude. His tail stroke began in his pelvis and undulated down his tail to his flukes in a single waveform, each stroke a shallow parabola. The girls, however, had much greater movement in their smaller bodies, only their outstretched fists stayed at a constant attitude while their head and shoulders moved as part of each stroke. Their tail strokes started high in their chests, undulating down their bodies in a double waveform, each stroke a sine curve. Emma decided that it was sexy, and while she didn\u0026rsquo;t know it yet, all the Mers had spent many a moment while swimming simply observing their mermaids swim because it was sexy.\nEmma imagined that at slower speeds, she could make her body appear even sexier, much like female gaits on dry land could be varied. For now, however, she would simply try to keep swimming fast, and later she could talk with her sisters about how they might drive MuSu to complete distraction. She admired the way that even these unconscious strokes of Rikki\u0026rsquo;s and Cleo\u0026rsquo;s showed off each part of the female mer-anatomy: first the breasts and waist, then the hips and upper tail, then finally the delicate base of their tails and their dramatically decorated flukes. Oh, yes, they could work on making their slow swimming sexy. Yes indeed.\nEmma watched as Cleo\u0026rsquo;s dark brown hair fluttered along her back, admiring her sister\u0026rsquo;s beauty and grace, knowing that it was mirrored exactly in her own recently feminized body. As she watched Cleo\u0026rsquo;s body undulate only a few feet from her, she noted that if she wanted to, she could touch each of her pod mates easily, but she would lose some her hydrodynamic properties and they would have to stop this particular experiment-their \u0026ldquo;as hard and as fast and as long as we can go test.\u0026rdquo; Instead, she let MuSu\u0026rsquo;s wake wash over her and felt herself buoyed by the draft of her powerful pod-mate. She heard the signal from Rikki, a slight vocal pulse in their high, female register, and Emma shifted her stroke in a brief burst of energy to replace Rikki on MuSu\u0026rsquo;s flank while Rikki dropped back to the bottom of the formation.\nStealing a glance at MuSu as she fell into place with her outthrust hands just behind the outermost tip of his extended pelvic fins and her head about even with his mid-tail fins, Emma could tell that her podmate was enjoying the power and exertion, seeking the outer limits of their endurance, and he barely looked winded. He was beautiful, his striped tail flashing, his shorter, darker hair pressed back along his upper shoulders, protecting his upper gills from the sunlight that caressed their bodies as they sped through the water a few meters below the surface. Emma watched the many muscles that rippled in graceful, powerful coordination down MuSu\u0026rsquo;s strong, thick tail, only a few decimeters away from her own fins, and she felt herself become aroused. She wondered if MuSu knew how sexy his muscles were, how much his shining, flashing tail with its dramatic yellow and black stripes, and his lightening yellow highlights along his elbow fins, his dorsal ridge, and his fins and flukes, all turned her on.\nIt was a good thing they were supposed to be doing this experiment, she thought to herself, otherwise they might be the last pod to reach the submarine. God, she just wanted to eat MuSu up, slide her body against his, press her breasts into his washboard stomach, and suck at his tiny male nipples.\nAaaarrrgggghhhh. Just swim! She yelled at herself silently.\nFour hours later, MuSu finally slowed down, his body shaking with fatigue. They surfaced, gulping in the air even as their gills stayed stiff in the water, drinking in the oxygen they craved from both the air and the water. Emma knew that MuSu had expended the most energy, maintaining his lead of the pod, but even so, she herself was glad to stop and rest. After only a few minutes of heavy breathing, their pulses returned to normal, and they began to look around. Emma could see a small atoll a few kilometers further along which she recognized as the half waypoint to the sub from the map Pat had shown her that morning. Emma had a photographic memory, which is why she was the head navigator in her pod.\n\u0026ldquo;MuSu,\u0026rdquo; she said, tapping him on the shoulder as they all relaxed, bobbing in the light surf with their heads above the surface. \u0026ldquo;There is the atoll that marks the half way point,\u0026rdquo; she pointed ahead of them. MuSu rose on his tail, his pelvic fins above the water, his rippling muscles along his tail and abdomen flexing as he kept his head nearly two meters above the surface of the water. His athletic display reignited a wave of desire that washed through Emma and the other girls like wildfire. As he sank back down, he noticed the lidded eyes of his pod-mates and smiled, enjoying his own sexual power reflected in they eyes of his beautiful trio of identical mermaids.\n\u0026ldquo;How about we stop there for lunch and a bit of fun?\u0026rdquo; he said with a wink and a leer at the girls. Just as Emma reached for him, he twisted away and headed towards the small island. The girls, giggling, gave chase. This was one of their favorite games, and MuSu easily kept himself just out of reach of the girls. Within minutes, they were all swimming at top speed again, but this time they were leaping and twisting in the water, and if anyone had been looking, they would have sworn that dolphins were at play, except for the visible human parts and the brilliant blue and white patterns on the smaller creatures, off set by the dramatic tiger strips on the larger one. Only when they got to the island did MuSu allow himself to be caught.\nPat glanced over at Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s pod, the three of them swimming steadily off to her right. They were probably making about 15 knots per hour, which was respectable, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to tire Petra or risk any complications with her now three-month-old pregnancy. Petra sensed Pat\u0026rsquo;s look, and flashed her a thumbs up. Pat again marveled at how even Petra, with her extraordinary large breasts and her pregnancy, could still slip through the water with such ease and grace.\nPat turned her attention to her own pod, and felt the comforting presence of everyone\u0026rsquo;s electrical signatures, no one signaling any distress. She could tell the mood and health of her pod mates, she had discovered, but she could only sense strong emotions in the other mers. She extended her senses further to her left and found Agba\u0026rsquo;s pod swimming easily. Everyone was doing well, even though they had been swimming steadily for several hours. They hadn\u0026rsquo;t caught up to MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod, and she didn\u0026rsquo;t know how far or how fast they had been able to swim. They looked fast when they left, but she wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how long they could keep up such a furious pace.\nShe concentrated on her pod mates, sensing Danni and Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s languid strokes, each of them focusing on John\u0026rsquo;s lead. John\u0026rsquo;s powerful tail set their pace, and Pat warmed at the memory of their frenzied reunion last night. Poor John had been forced to make love to each of them twice, and Pat had sensed a driving need in their efforts that seemed different. She remembered back to the strange tug she felt on her second coupling with John. She was looking into John\u0026rsquo;s eyes as he stroked in and out of her, and she wondered what color eyes any child of theirs would have as she gazed into his steel grey eyes. Would she have green eyes, like her own, or blue or grey or something else? She knew, both intuitively and scientifically, that all their children would be female, and a select few would transition to males. So focused was she on that image, on her daughter\u0026rsquo;s eyes, that a strange tug, deep within her tail, surprised her.\nPat had never felt that muscle before. It was a pleasurable tug, deep and strong, almost like a cramp, but it triggered an even more intense orgasm that kept her impaled, quivering and twitching, on John\u0026rsquo;s pumping cock for several minutes. Her internal muscles had rippled along his cock, ripping his own orgasm from him, and then kept them together in a suction so strong that John couldn\u0026rsquo;t separate himself from her even after he had finished coming. Pat had lost consciousness during the orgasm, and it took several minutes before she recovered.\nWhen Danni had asked what she was doing to have such a tremendous orgasm, Pat explained that she was thinking about Petra and wondered what color the eyes of any child she and John might have would be. Evidently, both Danni and Phoebe were able to think similar thoughts and achieve similarly strong orgasms. As with Pat, both girls had lost consciousness during their orgasms. John, exhausted, was barely able to finish the fish Pat had brought for him before he fell asleep.\nAs she looked at her pod, she could still sense the glow from both Danni and Phoebe. She knew she was glowing too. No \u0026hellip; wait \u0026hellip; it was more than a glow.\nPat closed her eyes, and focused on each of her sister wives with her mer-senses, and then herself, and then Petra. She nearly stopped swimming in shock, but instead, she savored a new kind of warmth that spread through her body. Well, how about that, Pat thought to herself. She had discovered the secret to mermaid fertility. They had to \u0026ldquo;will it\u0026rdquo; \u0026hellip; and so they had. She and her pod mates were pregnant; their electrical signatures had each changed, just like Petra\u0026rsquo;s. She would share the news with the others that evening when they reached the atoll. For now, she savored her secret all by her self.\nEmma thought that the morning marathon would have tired everyone out, but she wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to complain. Cleo had managed to tackle MuSu in the shallow water of the lagoon, and the two of them were pounding into each other in the surf. It was Cleo\u0026rsquo;s reward for not complaining, after all. Now Emma watched as Cleo and MuSu rolled and swam in the one meter of water, laughing and moaning, switching positions and rhythms without ever uncoupling. Emma was on the beach and Rikki was braiding her hair, their flukes resting in a several centimeters of water as the gentle surf washed along their tails barely reaching their pelvic fins.\n\u0026ldquo;I can hardly believe our lives,\u0026rdquo; Rikki mused as she ran her fingers through Emma\u0026rsquo;s soft, lush hair. \u0026ldquo;We live in a beautiful tropical paradise, and all we do is eat, swim, and have sex.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can hardly believe I\u0026rsquo;m finally your sister,\u0026rdquo; Emma said as she closed her eyes to concentrate on the feelings of Rikki\u0026rsquo;s fingers in her hair.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re more than my sister,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said, shifting her stroking to include Emma\u0026rsquo;s softly sloping shoulders and dramatically thin waist. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re my sister-wife, my best friend, and my lover,\u0026rdquo; she whispered into Emma\u0026rsquo;s ear, brushing aside her long brown hair, licking her ear lobe.\nEmma shivered with desire, and leaned back into Rikki\u0026rsquo;s caresses. \u0026ldquo;We are the only ones among all the pods who are truly \u0026lsquo;sister-wives,\u0026rdquo; Emma observed.\n\u0026ldquo;I love you, Emma,\u0026rdquo; Rikki whispered as she nuzzled Emma\u0026rsquo;s neck. \u0026ldquo;I always loved Martin, but I love you more than I thought possible.\u0026rdquo;\nEmma tilted her head back and found Rikki\u0026rsquo;s soft full lips with her own, and nibbled at her lips. She teased with her tongue along Rikki\u0026rsquo;s white teeth and ruby lips. Emma gasped as Rikki held her face firmly and kissed her with increasing passion, her tongue pushing into Emma\u0026rsquo;s mouth, searching, caressing, exploring. They kissed passionately for several moments before Rikki turned her body and lowered both of their shoulders to the damp sand.\nThey faced each other, on their sides, their breasts pressed into one another\u0026rsquo;s as they ran their hands along each other\u0026rsquo;s flanks. Emma watched as her now delicate, feminine hand traced the bulge of Rikki\u0026rsquo;s breast out from her rib cage, and let it fall along the dramatic indentation of her waist, accentuated by their posture on the beach. She watched as her hand rose along the swell of Rikki\u0026rsquo;s hips, and noted the barely perceptible change in texture from skin to scales as tanned skin merged with blue and white spots. One set of their pelvic fins was pressed to the sand, while the other flapped and teased at each other\u0026rsquo;s in the air. Emma grabbed Rikki\u0026rsquo;s fin and stroked along the yellow fringe that decorated the trailing edge. She gasped with pleasure as Rikki mimicked her actions on her own fin. She was so happy that her tail was such a source of pleasure.\nAs they held each other\u0026rsquo;s face with one hand and kissed, their other hands found each other\u0026rsquo;s vent, their labia now swollen with blood and passion. The nub of their clitorises were hard and wet, not with water but with their own fluids. Emma gasped into Rikki\u0026rsquo;s unceasing kisses as she felt two fingers ease into her vagina while Rikki\u0026rsquo;s thumb flicked across her clit. She eased two of her own fingers into Rikki\u0026rsquo;s molten vent and ran her thumb across her sister-wife\u0026rsquo;s clit, which caused her to moan too.\nEmma backed away from Rikki\u0026rsquo;s frantic kisses to look at her beautiful identical twin. Emma looked into Rikki\u0026rsquo;s large, oval blue eyes that sparkled with passion. Their noses were only centimeters apart, their lips open, their breath hot upon each other\u0026rsquo;s faces. Emma stroked her sister\u0026rsquo;s lush, chocolate brown hair, feeling its softness and texture, even as her other hand continued to push in and out of her sisterwife\u0026rsquo; s dripping vagina. She closed her eyes briefly, savoring the wonderful sensations caused by Rikki\u0026rsquo;s fingers as they pumped in and out of her own sopping wet hole. Emma loved the way her new body responded to sex, the rippling of her body outward from her womb, resonating in her breasts that swelled with milk, her nipples extending, hardening.\nShe opened her eyes with a gasp as Rikki pushed their breasts together, rubbing her leaking nipples on Emma\u0026rsquo;s own satisfyingly stiff and equally leaky nipples. She twisted her flukes across Rikki\u0026rsquo;s and doubled her efforts to bring her sister-wife to orgasm, but gasped herself as Rikki added another finger to her efforts. She too added a third finger and sought the hard knob of Rikki\u0026rsquo;s G-spot that was just at the tip of her fingers inside her vagina. As their breasts continued to slide and push against one another\u0026rsquo;s, Emma could feel her own orgasm beginning to build, and she fought to hold it off until Rikki began to twitch. Suddenly both girls were drenched in breast milk as their orgasms ripped through their bodies and cum flooded their fingers as they jerked on the beach, their hands buried within each other\u0026rsquo;s pulsing vaginas. Their flukes were at full extension, quivering in the noon sun, spraying light, color, and water in all directions, the sound of their fluttering flukes nearly overwhelmed by their screaming orgasms.\nAfter a few moments, when they finally stopped shaking, two pairs of hands grabbed their flukes and pulled them into the surf. Laughing, Emma turned to MuSu as Rikki turned to Cleo.\n\u0026ldquo;See, I told you that you could have first dibs,\u0026rdquo; Emma laughed.\n\u0026ldquo;Depends on whom I wanted first dibs with,\u0026rdquo; Cleo teased as she pulled Rikki into a deep kiss.\nA few strong strokes later, Emma was moaning into MuSu\u0026rsquo;s shoulder as he rolled with her in the surf, feeling herself shudder around his stiff and unflagging penis. As she convulsed in yet another orgasm, she faintly heard her sister-wives each crying out in their own.\nThere were hundreds of small atolls scattered throughout the South Pacific, some of the larger ones could even support human life, if it was carefully husbanded. One such atoll had two humans who were precariously clinging to life. Their experimental, secret submarine had suffered a catastrophic failure of the hull about eight weeks ago. No one knew why the hull had failed, but only ten crewmembers managed to escape. There had been no time-the water flooded the sub within seconds-and only those crewmembers in the scientific module at the bow had managed to make it out.\nThere had been six scientists and about 60 crewmembers on the vessel, but only the scientists had escaped along with four other crewmembers. They discovered that they escape pod they were able to launch as the sub plummeted to the ocean floor lacked adequate food and water, and the emergency beacon would not work. Some of the standard survival equipment was missing, and they had no means of fishing. They had drifted for two days before they managed to land the pod/raft on this very small island, and were pleased to discover that the atoll had a small, natural spring and a few palm trees. They set up a camp, scavenging the escape pod for materials, and they hoped against hope that they would be found. The ranking crewman, who was not an officer, explained that there was little chance of rescue. The sub was at the beginning of a two-month, clandestine, special ops tour for surveillance and reconnaissance. Their superiors wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even know to look for them until long after they had run out of food.\nThey struggled on the small island, growing weaker and hungrier as time passed. Several crewmembers were lost to sharks while they were attempting to hunt fish, and the other two had simply gone mad and swam out to sea. It hadn\u0026rsquo;t helped when they learned that their guns were nearly useless to hunt fish. Bullets never reached their targets, and so they were forced to go into the water to try to collect food with knives and crudely made spears.\nAs more time passed, and hunger drove them further out to sea to search for food, the remaining scientists had became food themselves, as the sharks were particularly aggressive. Now, there were only two left.\nAlexander and Grisha had been part of a \u0026ldquo;secret\u0026rdquo; team doing research on deep-sea biological and genetic experiments, but now they were quickly shrinking shells of themselves, nearly mad with hunger and thirst, surviving on what shellfish and seaweed they could collect. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough. They were slowly starving themselves to death. But the deeper water was too dangerous, a difficult lesson they learned as they watched their friends and crewmates disappear with a sharp tug beneath the waves. So, they had given up on trying to get larger fish, and now they were too weak to do anything other than wait for the end to come.\nAs they finished their lunch, MuSu and the girls decided to keep going. They felt a bit stretched, but they knew that hadn\u0026rsquo;t reached \u0026ldquo;their limits,\u0026rdquo; which was part of what they needed to know. How far and how fast could they push themselves? The answer might be the difference between life and death in the future.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s try something different,\u0026rdquo; Emma said as she finished un-braiding Cleo\u0026rsquo;s hair. All the girls loved to play with one another\u0026rsquo;s hair, but Emma knew that if they left their gills exposed to the sun, it would be dangerous.\n\u0026ldquo;How so?\u0026rdquo; asked MuSu?\n\u0026ldquo;One of the things that seemed strange to me was how quickly we recovered from our fatigue when we surfaced,\u0026rdquo; Emma explained. \u0026ldquo;We were all pretty tired, but after only a few minutes of breathing the air, we all recovered enough to have some pretty awesome sex.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, what \u0026hellip; we should swim on our backs?\u0026rdquo; asked Rikki\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Emma explained. \u0026ldquo;I think we should develop a rhythm, sort of like the dolphins do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But they have to breathe the air,\u0026rdquo; Cleo observed, \u0026ldquo;They don\u0026rsquo;t have gills.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Emma agreed, \u0026ldquo;but I think that we are still mammal enough that if we regularly breathe the air, we will be much faster and last longer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we risk being seen?\u0026rdquo; MuSu observed.\n\u0026ldquo;True,\u0026rdquo; Emma agreed. \u0026ldquo;But this is the South Pacific, and that isn\u0026rsquo;t very likely. If we are spotted, we are likely to have enough warning to get below and stay there. From far away I bet we look more like a large fish than we think we do. After all, we\u0026rsquo;re mostly tail.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; MuSu agreed, looking down his nearly three meters of strong, shimmering, mer-tail. \u0026ldquo;We are about the same size as large dolphins or sailfish.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We look like sailfish,\u0026rdquo; Emma corrected. \u0026ldquo;You look like a dolphin. Sailfish rarely reach your length, and we must weigh at least as half as much as you do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, what should we try, before we get into an argument about who weighs what?\u0026rdquo; Rikki asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s follow MuSu\u0026rsquo;s lead, since he does most of the work,\u0026rdquo; Emma explained. \u0026ldquo;We can draft just like we did this morning; we will just know that every minute or two or whatever, we will all breach and take a big breath of regular air.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll expel whatever air is left in my lungs right before I head for the surface, so that can be a signal,\u0026rdquo; MuSu suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;Remember, build up our speed slowly, because we will reach our top speed before you do,\u0026rdquo; Cleo worried.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you worry,\u0026rdquo; MuSu with a kiss, \u0026ldquo;I can sense each of you clearly, and I know the exact point when you all have reached your top speed. I know I could go faster, but I suppose that\u0026rsquo;s why you draft my wake.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We were all doing about 30 knots this morning,\u0026rdquo; Emma observed, \u0026ldquo;if my calculations are reasonable. It took us about six hours to go almost 200 nautical miles. That is faster than most boats go,\u0026rdquo; she finished impressed with their own speed.\n\u0026ldquo;That is faster than dolphins can go without drafting on boats,\u0026rdquo; MuSu added. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to Pat, miss smarty pants,\u0026rdquo; he finished as Emma raised her eyebrows in surprise. \u0026ldquo;They usually swim at about 10 knots and can only go 25 knots for short periods of time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can go faster than that!\u0026rdquo; Emma urged.\nThey all wiggled their way off the beach and into the water. Emma made a few more observations and indicated a direction for MuSu. They all nodded, sensing directions in the same way they sensed the shape of the sea floor or the presence of sharks several hundred meters north of their current location.\nMuSu built up speed slowly, as Cleo had asked, and soon they had reached their previous top speed. Now, rather than swimming several meters below the surface, they were within a meter of the surface, swimming in tight formation. With a burst of air and a flick of his tail, MuSu was headed for the surface and the girls stayed glued to their formation.\nTheir hydrophobic skin, scales, and hair caused the water to fall off them as they launched into the air, all four creatures arcing gracefully above the water. They traveled for about two meters through the air before MuSu curved back into the water. He remembered watching dolphins draft the boats as he (well, back then he was a she) traveled from Hong Kong to Macau, and so he took only a few quick strokes and headed back for the surface.\nThe speed was exhilarating, Emma thought! They were swimming with enormous energy, cresting the surface every few strokes, keeping their bodies parallel to the water, stretching out each leap in shallow arcs above the water, feeling the cool water enfold them as they sliced back into its embrace; then leaping forward into the air, the water falling away from their bodies, their hair staying plastered to their backs as they leapt from wave to wave to wave. They were all breathing easily, effortlessly, as they sliced through the air and water, laughing and swimming, winking at each other as they cruised through and above the water. Duh, she thought to herself. The air was much less dense than the water, and therefore it was even easier to maintain their high speed, because they were spending as much time as possible in the air.\nFour hours later, they had reached the location of the submarine, and they hardly seemed winded. They had discovered how extraordinary a marine mammal that mers actually were, and they were so energized by their discovery, that they decided to keep swimming past the location of the sub. They had made a 370 nautical mile trip in about ten hours, and they were exhilarated. Emma estimated that their top speed was about 40 knots, and that MuSu and the other mermen could probably reach 50 knots or more on their own.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, they were here earlier today,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, pointing to the distinctive trail left by a mermaid salamandering across the sand, disappearing suddenly where the waves had smoothed over the sand. \u0026ldquo;High tide was earlier today, sometime in the early afternoon, so they were here before then. I would say a little after noon.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which means that they were swimming incredibly fast for a very long time,\u0026rdquo; Pat concluded. \u0026ldquo;What time do you think it is now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I would guess early evening, say 8 PM,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, looking at the sun hovering a few degrees above the horizon.\n\u0026ldquo;Which meant that we swam \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Geesh, don\u0026rsquo;t you ever stop being a scientist,\u0026rdquo; teased Danni as she snuggled up to Pat and gave her a quick kiss.\n\u0026ldquo;I like it,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Brown-noser,\u0026rdquo; Danni teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Blonde,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe taunted.\n\u0026ldquo;Look who\u0026rsquo;s talking,\u0026rdquo; Danni said smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;Girls,\u0026rdquo; Pat warned, \u0026ldquo;we are in the middle of something?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right, sorry,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;Um, that means that we were doing just over 15 knots to go 188 nautical miles in about 12 hours.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;And that didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to tire us out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean didn\u0026rsquo;t tire Petra out,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said indicating the now resting Petra, her former uncle who was now several months pregnant.\n\u0026ldquo;I feel great,\u0026rdquo; Petra said from her lounging spot on the sandy beach, finishing up some squid that Gabriel had brought for her. Xing was playing with Petra\u0026rsquo;s hair while Gabriel and Agba had gone fishing, Angara and Liga lounged nearby. John was the only male mer present.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I mean that it didn\u0026rsquo;t tire US out,\u0026rdquo; Pat repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean us?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe teased, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m younger than either of you old ladies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She means tire you out because all three of you are pregnant,\u0026rdquo; Xing said blithely as she braided Petra\u0026rsquo;s hair.\n\u0026ldquo;What!\u0026rdquo; John sputtered, rising from the sand on the other side of Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, dear,\u0026rdquo; Pat smiled. \u0026ldquo;last night \u0026hellip; all three of us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But how \u0026hellip; why \u0026hellip; when?\u0026rdquo; he continued.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought you guys were different this morning,\u0026rdquo; Liga said, \u0026ldquo;but I thought it was because I am still learning how to be a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re doing great,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;I noticed it this morning too, and I think I\u0026rsquo;ve put together some important clues.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my GOD! You\u0026rsquo;re right!\u0026rdquo; Danni squealed, opening her eyes, \u0026ldquo;I can feel it \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m different inside!\u0026rdquo; She rolled over Pat and tackled John, kissing him soundly. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to be a mother!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What important clues?\u0026rdquo; demanded Phoebe, who sounded both excited and frightened at the same time?\n\u0026ldquo;Petra,\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, \u0026ldquo;do you remember anything different when you were making love to Michael?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean, different?\u0026rdquo; asked Petra.\n\u0026ldquo;Did you have a particularly memorable orgasm a few days before he died?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked gently.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I did!\u0026rdquo; Petra answered, remembering.\n\u0026ldquo;Did you feel anything strange in your tail just before you orgasmed?\u0026rdquo; Pat continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I think I did,\u0026rdquo; Petra answered, thinking. \u0026ldquo;I felt some sort of muscle cramp in my tail, but I thought it was just the passion I was feeling and I was being too rough.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And were you thinking about having a child?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I was always thinking about that,\u0026rdquo; Petra answered, \u0026ldquo;but that time, I was thinking about Michael\u0026rsquo;s eyes, and what would happen if we did have a child, you know, what color the baby\u0026rsquo;s eyes would be.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe breathed. \u0026ldquo;That IS how it worked! We really are pregnant.\u0026rdquo; She fell into Pat\u0026rsquo;s embrace. \u0026ldquo;What are we going to do?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Have a baby,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered calmly, stroking her sister-wife\u0026rsquo;s nearly white blond hair. \u0026ldquo;But at least we will know what to expect, thanks to Petra.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s it?\u0026rdquo; asked Xing, incredulous. \u0026ldquo;You have to think of the eyes? I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting a child with Gabriel for months, but I never think of eyes, I always think of tail,\u0026rdquo; she finished, running her hands along her own forest green and lavender tail.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Xing, you must have first go with Gabriel tonight,\u0026rdquo; Petra gushed. \u0026ldquo;Between your hazel and his violet eyes I can only imagine a wonderful, beautiful playmate for Michelle that you might have,\u0026rdquo; she finished as she caressed her own belly, even though there was no outward sign that she was pregnant.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, now we finally know what constitutes mermaid birth control,\u0026rdquo; John concluded. \u0026ldquo;That must be why no one got pregnant despite all the sex we were having.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;I think he\u0026rsquo;s right,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Right? Of course I\u0026rsquo;m right,\u0026rdquo; John concluded. \u0026ldquo;I knew something was different last night, and now I\u0026rsquo;m never opening my eyes during sex again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, don\u0026rsquo;t you dare,\u0026rdquo; Danni demanded as she began tickling her podmate.\n\u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t make me,\u0026rdquo; John gasped as he writhed on the sand under her merciless attack.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe she can\u0026rsquo;t, but WE can,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, lifting herself away from Phoebe and joining Danni in the attack.\n\u0026ldquo;I think I could live with that,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe mused. \u0026ldquo;I want to be a scientist,\u0026rdquo; she concluded as she winked at Petra and Xing and joined her sister-wives in tickling the now nearly helpless John.\n\u0026ldquo;Stop \u0026hellip; top \u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip; please,\u0026rdquo; he pleaded as the three mermaids squirmed and rubbed themselves all over him as they ground him into the sand. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m getting sand in places I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; he complained.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem,\u0026rdquo; Danni said with a wink to Pat and Phoebe. The girls clasped hands and rolled all four of them into the water. They disappeared beneath the surface laughing and giggling.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t wait until our men get back,\u0026rdquo; Xing said with passion and purpose in her voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Me too,\u0026rdquo; said Liga as Angara lifted a surprised eyebrow at her. \u0026ldquo;Well, I think it must be why I got changed, to give you and Agba children.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Quién dice que yo no desean a niña?\u0026rdquo; Angara asked with a smile and a kiss for Liga.\n\u0026ldquo;Looks like everyone will be pregnant shortly,\u0026rdquo; Petra mused. \u0026ldquo;Perhaps we ought not to tell the triplets, and maybe they won\u0026rsquo;t get pregnant. Someone has to get food for the rest of us.\u0026rdquo;\nIt was near sunset when the remaining Russians concluded that they had finally gone completely mad.\nGrisha had stretched out his increasingly thinning body on the beach, his head propped up against one of the few palm trees on the atoll. He had stumbled down to the water earlier in the day, searching for food of any kind, hoping for a half-eaten fish to wash ashore. After several hours of nearly fruitless searching, he had retreated to the scant shelter he and Alexander occupied. Grisha had been a big man, nearly 6' 4'' (193 cm), almost too big to fit onto the submarine, but at 50 years old, he was the leading scientist in his field, and he had insisted that he be allowed to carry out the experiments he had designed. When he first squeezed his bulk into his submarine berth, he weighed nearly 300 pounds (136 kg). Now, he was lucky if he weighed 200 lb (90 kg).\nHe looked over at the sleeping Alexander, who was nearly a foot shorter (173 cm), and weighed about half as much as he did. Grisha didn\u0026rsquo;t think Alexander would make it through the night, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t relish the thought of spending his last few days on earth next to a rotting scientist, even if he had always respected Alexander\u0026rsquo;s work.\nHe was about to close his eyes when he saw a school of large fish approaching from the south. They were swimming like dolphins, leaping and skimming along the surface of the water, headed directly for the island. They weren\u0026rsquo;t dolphins, however, the colors were all wrong, and it looked like the creatures had brown skin at their noses, pale skin along their mid-flanks, and brightly mottled blue and white skin along their longish tails. The largest one had black and yellow tiger stripes. How could that be? They were large, perhaps three or four meters long. He was a geneticist, not a biologist, like his surviving crewmate.\n\u0026ldquo;Alexander, my friend,\u0026rdquo; Grisha whispered, his voice dry and strained, \u0026ldquo;do those look like dolphins to you?\u0026rdquo;\nWith a supreme effort, Alexander lifted his head from the sand and gazed out at the sea. He could see the flashes of color and light as a small pod of brightly colored sea creatures burst from the sea, and he swore he could hear laughter, female laughter.\n\u0026ldquo;We have gone mad, Grisha,\u0026rdquo; he whispered back, \u0026ldquo;those are rusalka.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Either we are mad, or we are saved,\u0026rdquo; Grisha said as he struggled to his feet. \u0026ldquo;Here, here!\u0026rdquo; he croaked. \u0026ldquo;We are here, save us,\u0026rdquo; he shouted in Russian.\nThe effort cost him is consciousness, and he fell to the ground in a heap. Alexander saw that the strange creatures had seen them as he felt his own consciousness slipping away, but not before he could make out the faces of three beautiful women who gazed at him in shock and surprise.\nHe smiled as he succumbed to the darkness, unsure if he would ever wake again.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, is it working?\u0026rdquo; Cleo asked impatiently.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Emma answered calmly. \u0026ldquo;I have no idea how long we were unconscious the first time we were fed.\u0026rdquo;\nMuSu looked over at the two girls who each cradled the head of a nearly dead Russian sailor in their laps. He and Rikki had scoured the small island, hidden the one handgun they found, and now Rikki was filling one of their canteens with her milk, massaging her young breast so that streams of mermaid milk shot into the plastic bottle.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve done all you can for the moment,\u0026rdquo; MuSu advised. \u0026ldquo;We will leave them the canteen and we should return after we meet up with everyone else; this is not something for us to try on our own.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But will it be enough to save them?\u0026rdquo; Cleo asked, her mothering instincts coming to the fore.\n\u0026ldquo;It only took us two hours to reach this island,\u0026rdquo; Emma argued. \u0026ldquo;We can stay overnight, to see if they regain consciousness, and at least to force them to drink a little more of our milk. We can easily swim back long before the others will reach the submarine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They will die if we don\u0026rsquo;t save them,\u0026rdquo; Cleo added.\n\u0026ldquo;They may die anyway,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said. \u0026ldquo;Alright, we can\u0026rsquo;t sleep in the water around this island, there are too many sharks along that reef, which is probably where the rest of the crew ended up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why didn\u0026rsquo;t they bother us?\u0026rdquo; asked Rikki, replacing the top on the now filled canteen.\n\u0026ldquo;Because we are as fast as they are,\u0026rdquo; Emma surmised, \u0026ldquo;and they\u0026rsquo;ve never seen a mer before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They might attack us if they are hungry enough,\u0026rdquo; MuSu thought, \u0026ldquo;but let\u0026rsquo;s not give them the chance. First, finish the food I brought for all you nursemaids.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter they finished eating, they arranged themselves on the beach, well above the high tide mark, in a star formation. They found that when in strange places it was a good idea to have their tails (and thus their mer senses) pointing in multiple directions. While their mer-senses didn\u0026rsquo;t work as well out of water as in, they could still sense when someone or something approached. When they were in the water, sleeping entwined around MuSu, there was a dorsal ridge facing each direction of the compass. On land, their fringes along their flukes and fins would have to suffice. They also knew that their maximum air time was about eight hours, and then they would begin to feel too dry and that would wake up to seek the water. The day\u0026rsquo;s efforts and excitement had worn them out, and the nooner had taken the edge off their sexual drives. So, with only kisses all around, they quickly fell asleep.\nBy the next afternoon, the Russians had not yet regained consciousness, but neither had they died. Emma half sensed and half hoped that their milk was having the desired effect. Her mer-senses seemed to suggest that their health was improving, but with anyone other than her pod mates, it was tough to tell. They had dribbled more milk onto their lips, and both men seemed to respond, enough so the contents of the canteen slowly disappeared into their bodies. The girls refilled two canteens in case the men awoke while they were gone, and returned to the water.\nAs MuSu and his girls began the swim back to the sub, Emma began to construct her justification and argument for Pat and John, their de facto leaders. After all, two pods were short of the optimal ratio, and she was sure she could convince anyone of the benefits of becoming both a female and a mermaid.\nMuSu kept a slightly slower pace, probably about 25 knots, but with the new technique of flying along the surface of the water, even that speed seemed effortless.\nThey had been waiting for several hours, floating about five meters below the surface, several hundred meters above the submarine, before the rest of the pods arrived. Emma wasted no time not only making a full report of their findings concerning mer-physiology, stamina, swimming techniques, and top speeds but also the news about the Russian sailors they had found, probably the only ones surviving from the sub below.\nPat advised the triplets of her own discovery concerning children, and the relief in their eyes gratified her. They couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop having sex, but they could exercise some control over when they had children. Pat giggled as MuSu recoiled in horror as Cleo playfully batted her eyes at him. It was the first time she could recall him losing his cool. All three girls were adamant, however, about not starting a family yet, especially with everyone else getting pregnant.\nThe triplets reluctantly agreed to wait until the next morning before returning to the atoll. Throughout the night, each pod took up guard duty, but the night passed without incident, and in the morning, they all headed for the atoll and the Russians.\nThirty-five was too young an age to die, Alexander thought to himself, as he sensed a bright light filling his consciousness. But he could also feel warmth emanating from that bright light. He could also feel something on his chest, and the sand beneath his head, and \u0026hellip; yes, the sound of the waves as they caressed the beach. He realized that he was feeling the sun as it rose in the east. He didn\u0026rsquo;t think he would ever see another, and yet here he was, slowly awakening to beautiful sunrise. He had an odd taste in his mouth, but he felt better than he had in a long time. He was ravenously hungry, but as his eyes blinked open in the morning light, he felt truly alive for the first time in several weeks.\nHe sat up, marveling at his own returning strength, and felt the canteen that had been placed on his chest slide down to his lap. How had that canteen gotten there, he wondered. And how did Grisha manage to get to the spring a hundred meters behind them? He saw a second canteen perched on Grisha\u0026rsquo;s chest, and saw that his fellow scientist was still asleep. He carefully opened his canteen and smelled the sweet smell of ambrosia. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what it was; it smelled faintly of flowers and salt, perhaps milk, but that was impossible. He carefully raised the canteen to his lips, and as the warm, sweet liquid poured down his throat, he swore that he could feel energy and life returning to his body with each small sip.\nHe pulled the plastic bottle from his lips, shocked at how he was feeling, and then turned to the ocean, where he could see more than a dozen heads bobbing in the water a few meters from shore. They were the most beautiful creatures he had ever seen, four men, and nearly a dozen women, each more beautiful than the next. The one with flaming red hair waved at him, and he waved back, shoving his now working foot into the side of Grisha\u0026rsquo;s still sleeping form.\n\u0026ldquo;Wake up, Grisha,\u0026rdquo; he urged. \u0026ldquo;We have company!\u0026rdquo;\nIt was fortunate that Grisha spoke Chinese; otherwise, they would have been days in explaining everything to the Russians. Alexander could ask for beer and the bathroom in English, and Grisha was not much better. But Grisha\u0026rsquo;s Chinese was good. Both men had gained strength and mobility throughout the morning as they listened to Pat and John while they slowly finished their canteens. Pat explained the history of the mers, and how they came to be, corrected only occasionally by Xing when Pat\u0026rsquo;s still fledgling Chinese failed her.\nGrisha had no problem understanding the story of the mers and what was already happening to him and his fellow countryman, whether they liked it or not. There was a tense moment, however, when Alexander finally understood that the milk he was drinking was a change agent, one that was likely to take him down a path of femininity.\nA frantic conversation in Russian between the two men erupted, occasionally interrupted by angry questions directed at the mers, suggesting that perhaps Agba or Gabriel switch back to female. Even Petra was surprised by the strength of Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s refusal.\nAfter another ten minutes of heated conversation, there were several moments of tense silence, while Alexander glowered at Agba, Gabriel, and then Grisha, again and again. He finally smiled at Emma, said something in Russian, and drank again from the canteen.\n\u0026ldquo;You saved my life,\u0026rdquo; Grisha translated in Chinese.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re sorry that you have to become girls,\u0026rdquo; Emma said in her own halting Chinese. \u0026ldquo;I used to be a boy, and this is much better.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We shall see,\u0026rdquo; Grisha returned with little emotion.\nThe two men talked again in Russian for a few minutes, and then Alexander nodded at Agba, lifted his canteen in salute, and then downed the contents. Agba nodded with respect, while Angara and Liga looked approvingly at their new pod mate. Everyone sighed in relief for several reasons. First, because the Russians seemed reconciled to their situation, second because Grisha and Alexander had come to an agreement about who would go to which pod, and finally (but not the least factor for relief) was because an important new knowledge base would be added to their growing community.\nThe mers returned to the sea to look for a protected area in which the transformations might occur, and after several hours of searching the land shelf of the atoll and several other smaller islands, they found a small underwater cave that although shallow, offered some protection from the surrounding sea. It was in about five meters of water, and if the Russians followed the \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; patterns of transition, as had the other recent mers, they would have proto gills by the next morning.\nGrisha waited on the beach for the return of the mers. As predicted, the next morning both men had immature gills on their backs, and Alexander had insisted that he go first. He had apparently been thinking about his decision all night, and if any of the tales the mers had told were true, then he would be able to communicate with his new family and community right after his transition, and he was tired of waiting for Grisha\u0026rsquo;s slow and cumbersome translations. He wanted to speak to these fascinating and beautiful new people, even if the price was his own masculinity. Grisha didn\u0026rsquo;t entirely believe him, but it was enough, Alexander could go first.\nAlexander had gone off with the rest of the mers, surprisingly eager for his new life. Grisha had stayed behind, still struggling with what was about to happen to him. He understood genetics, and he suspected that Pat had stumbled upon an important discovery, one that transcended all his previous research. Hell, this discovery transcended his gender, his own country, and even his own species. Nevertheless, Grisha was not as eager to become a mermaid as Alexander, even if he was to be paired to the incredible Petra-a fine Slavic name-and the delicate and beautiful Xing. Frankly, Gabriel scared him, especially after he angrily refused Grisha\u0026rsquo;s suggestion that Gabriel return to his former gender. Grisha had rarely seen such fire and power in anyone\u0026rsquo;s eyes, and wondered what could make a former female, Christian missionary, become such a dynamic and powerful merman.\nHe wondered for a moment how much of a factor the ratio of mass to mermaid and mermen contributed to the way he was feeling. He had always been a big man, while Alexander was slight. Perhaps that is why Alexander chose the smaller Filipino pod, as he or she would probably end up as a large female in that pod. Well, in that case, he would probably be the equal of Petra, who was the tallest and most voluptuous of all the mermaids. What would he look like, he wondered. Pat had told him that he should be thinking of some one he knew, that he would become something like that woman. He had no idea what he should look like.\nHe distracted himself from his upcoming transformation by puzzling out the mechanisms of the milk that still sloshed in the canteen they had left with him while Alexander under went his change. Grisha\u0026rsquo;s own work had involved transgenic adaptations in various sea animals. He would attempt to isolate single genes, like the ability to generate bioluminescent light that many deep-sea fish had, and then insert them into the fertilized eggs of other fish so that the resulting gene would be \u0026ldquo;turned on\u0026rdquo; in the resulting adult. These \u0026ldquo;transgenes\u0026rdquo; were typically inserted into eggs using a glass needle, but the method was not reliable and rarely resulted in a successful birth. However, when it was successful, the new organism passed on the new trait to its offspring with out any problems.\nGrisha suspected that Pat\u0026rsquo;s experiments with the original fish goop had resulted in a transgenic agent that merged biological, chemical, neurological, and some yet undiscovered processes into a change agent that was incredibly powerful and had limitless possibilities. He could create bacteria that produced medicine, or bio-computers capable of augmenting the human brain. Well, now, that was a thought more interesting to him than what color his tail might be. What if he focused on becoming incredibly bright, a super computer brain, while he underwent the change? If having that knowledge and those abilities meant becoming a girl-a mermaid-then he would pay that price, he decided. He was unsure of Alexander\u0026rsquo;s, well \u0026hellip; now probably Alexis', motives, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t trouble himself with any of the details. If what Pat said was true, her breasts held the secrets to eternal life and the salvation of mankind.\nLife as a girl, huh? Like many ambitious scientists, he had never managed to couple himself to anyone who seemed compatible, but he had had several girlfriends and lovers. He mulled over his impending changes and thought that he could probably adapt. He especially liked that all the pods were bi-sexual, though secretly, he wished that he could be the male. Petra was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen, human or not, and he was very glad when Alexander had picked the smaller pod to join. He suspected that if anything ever happened to Agba, Alexander would be eager to make the transition to merman. He knew that such thoughts entered his mind concerning Gabriel.\nHis thoughts were interrupted by the sight of a striking female face that rose from the water a few meters from the beach. Her feminine face shone with a bright inner light, her deep blue eyes were set wide apart above strong cheek bones and full lips, hinting at her Russian heritage, while her blonde hair cascaded down her shoulders.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you coming, Galina?\u0026rdquo; the woman asked in perfect Russian.\nGrisha smiled at the imaginatively mangled feminine version of his name, but he liked it.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Alexis,\u0026rdquo; he said, guessing at what the former biologist had done to his name, and he rose to stride into the water. \u0026ldquo;I am coming.\u0026rdquo;\nIt took twenty minutes to reach the cave, which was at the far end of the land shelf for this small island. Grisha watched with fascination as both Agba\u0026rsquo;s and Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s pods escorted him through the water. He was naked, and his hairy and now thin body felt like a feather being pulled along by Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s strong strokes. Petra and Xing swam along side, near the surface, while Agba\u0026rsquo;s pod with their newest addition swam below them, warding off the many sharks that had already claimed his friends and countrymen.\nThe sharks seemed genuinely spooked by the mers, and Grisha wondered if the mer\u0026rsquo;s bio-electro-chemical systems had something to do with that. Sharks had very sensitive electroreceptor organs, and apparently, the mers shared a similar sensitivity. Whatever the reason, the sharks shied away from the two pods even as they dragged along their still vulnerable human.\nGrisha noted that his gills were already working, but he still needed to turn on his side to take a breath of air. When he turned back to face down, he could see Alexis swimming with her new pod mates. She was the largest mermaid in that pod, about a foot (30 cm) longer than the white and pink female and the black and white female. Alexis was still a few centimeters shorter than Agba, but his silver and black tail was wider, stronger, and longer than hers. Alexis' blond hair flowed down her back, her tiny waist, and over her now wide (and pink) hips. Her dorsal ridge, the ends of her flukes and fins were all tinged with white highlights while her long and graceful tail matched the pink highlights of the white-tailed female.\nGrisha examined the coloration of his future pod mates, and suddenly thought about his mother. She had been a redhead, not like Pat\u0026rsquo;s bright and rich red, but lighter, almost a pale reddish blond, with clear blue eyes. She loved the rich colors of the forest and farm, and Petra and Xing\u0026rsquo;s coloration would have made her smile. He remembered that she used to wear a dark maroon dress to church that enhanced her pale, freckled skin and her feathery red hair. He smiled, as he remembered his now dead mother, and thought yes, I finally know what I will look like.\nPetra, perhaps sensing his resolution, caressed his arm, and signaled that he should take a final breath before they plunged down 10 meters to the cave below. He would have enough air for about ten minutes, but his transition would soon override that need. He looked upward at the blue sky, untouched by clouds, breathed deep his last breath as a human male, and turned for the bottom.\nGabriel pulled him into the center of the cave where all the other mers had arranged themselves in a circle. The sensual charge in the cave was palpable, and all the mers were bioluminescent, pale light shimmering up and down their dorsal ridges and along their flukes and fins, augmenting the dim light filtering from above. He felt his heart begin to pound, not because he was in 10 meters of water and the pressure was intense, but rather because he could sense the power and majesty that these creatures exuded. He struggled to maintain his focus on the super smart brain he would have as Petra gathered him to her enormous breasts, and said, \u0026ldquo;Welcome Galina, drink from me and receive your tail.\u0026rdquo;\nAs his lips slowly closed the distance to her out thrust nipple, he felt light headed and dizzy. He tried to remember his mother, but found he could not.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait,\u0026rdquo; he said, wasting some of his air.\nPetra sensed something was wrong, and Grisha watched as her chest rose and fell quickly, and then she pulled him to her mouth as though to kiss him. He was surprised when she blew a lungful of air into him.\n\u0026ldquo;Go ahead, talk,\u0026rdquo; She urged, \u0026ldquo;I can keep giving you air.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You can?\u0026rdquo; he asked, stunned.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, but let\u0026rsquo;s not waste too much time here,\u0026rdquo; Petra cautioned. \u0026ldquo;What is the problem?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t hold the vision in my head,\u0026rdquo; he said softly, only Petra could hear him. \u0026ldquo;Too dizzy, too much \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Another lungful of air was forced into him.\n\u0026ldquo;My mother \u0026hellip; maroon dress, light red hair, blue eyes,\u0026rdquo; he whispered and then received another lungful of air. \u0026ldquo;Maroon tail \u0026hellip; your size,\u0026rdquo; he finished.\n\u0026ldquo;My size?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked. \u0026ldquo;All of my size?\u0026rdquo; she asked, sweeping her gaze along her breasts and hips.\nHe nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright everyone,\u0026rdquo; she said in her mermaid\u0026rsquo;s silvery voice, \u0026ldquo;His mother\u0026rsquo;s coloring, a maroon tail, blue eyes, and light red hair; now concentrate.\u0026rdquo; She gave Grisha/Galina another breath of air, and then pulled him back to her breast.\nGrisha/Galina could feel the shift in energy in the cave, and everyone started humming. He found Petra\u0026rsquo;s large breasts irresistible, and he closed his lips around her large nipple. The milk literally gushed down his throat, and he could feel a new energy building within his naked body. He frantically gulped her milk as it literally poured from her breasts. He could feel new strength in his body after only a few minutes, and the pressure from the water seemed to lessen. By the time he had finished her other breast, he could tell that his gills were working just fine, and that his journey toward womanhood, or rather mermaid-hood, had begun in earnest.\nPetra could see that Grisha/Galina\u0026rsquo;s dark brown eyes had lightened, and his/her body looked healthier. She could also tell that motherhood had increased her potency, and she gave the changeling a gentle push towards Xing, and resumed humming.\nGrisha/Galina floated towards Xing, who was about over a foot shorter than Petra, and took the raven-haired Asian beauty into his arms and kissed her. \u0026ldquo;My last kiss as a man,\u0026rdquo; he said with a bit of difficulty. Xing smiled and blew a bit of air into her future pod mate and said, \u0026ldquo;But not your last kiss from me, Galina. Drink from me and receive your tail.\u0026rdquo;\nAs he drank, \u0026ldquo;Galina\u0026rdquo; gave himself over to the vision that both pressed upon her from without, the combined focus and energy of the mers, and pressed outward from within his/her own changing consciousness. He gently sucked on Xing\u0026rsquo;s breast and was surprised to find that her milk gushed with the same force as Petra\u0026rsquo;s. Xing could also feel her increased potency, as the previous night\u0026rsquo;s sex with Gabriel had proved fruitful. Ignorant of Xing\u0026rsquo;s impending motherhood, Galina encircled his still male arms around the delicate Chinese mermaid, and drank deeply from her, focusing on the vision of the redheaded, blue-eyed, maroon mermaid who was very smart. Galina remained the scientist, cataloguing what he/she could feel within his/her body and what he could sense, with growing clarity, that which the mers were projecting onto him.\nAs he/she moved from Xing to Pat, Galina could feel his body hair falling away, as his male skin began to tighten and shrink. Pat invited him to receive \u0026ldquo;her\u0026rdquo; tail, and as Galina pulled deeply from Pat\u0026rsquo;s large breasts, nearly the equal to Petra\u0026rsquo;s, he could begin to feel the power of the mermaid\u0026rsquo;s milk begin to build within his body. After Danni invited \u0026ldquo;her\u0026rdquo; to receive her tail, Galina\u0026rsquo;s body began to convulse as the milk\u0026rsquo;s power began to attack her male body, breaking it down, and reforming it into a female one. Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s breasts added more power, more change agent, and Galina could feel his bones shrinking, their mass becoming less and less. His entire body ached, but the power of the milk kept the pain from being too great. Even as the pain of bones changing throbbed throughout his body, Galina could feel a renewed vigor flow through his veins. He was getting younger even as he was changing into a woman.\nAs Galina turned to John, the largest merman in the group, he could tell that she was about to turn a corner from which there would be no turning back. He could feel the powerful focus of all the mers that hung in the water all around him, their humming seemed to carry the strength of their vision through the water, vibrating through his body, shaping his bones, cells, even his consciousness, to their will. He decided to not fight the force of the mers, but rather sought to keep a focus on his desire to be a genius. It was hard to keep that focus, as the force of fifteen mers bore down on him.\n\u0026ldquo;Welcome Galina, drink from me and receive your tail,\u0026rdquo; John sang as Galina floated towards his incredible cock, thrusting stiffly upwards from his tail, over 35 centimeters (14'') extended outwards at a 45 degree angle. The moment he/she reached out with his/her increasingly delicate hand and took him into HER mouth, she felt the change within. Galina throbbed within her, and soon would be made real. John exploded into her immediately, and she nearly choked as she swallowed it down. Even as his semen pushed down her throat, Galina could feel further changes beginning in her body. Her hips were now pushing outwards, slowly, steadily, painfully, while her shoulders were narrowing, and her rib cage was shifting and shrinking. In seconds, John was done, and Galina was fully in the grip of her transformation.\nAs she floated to Alexis, she could feel her abdomen tightening and her reproductive organs begin to change. After Alexis sang her invitation, Galina could feel her former fellow scientist\u0026rsquo;s milk begin to force her testicles change into ovaries. Alexis swooned with her first feeding, and focused her thoughts on how Galina would become a sexual goddess. Galina felt the force of Alexis' thoughts, and struggled to remain focused on her super brain, but the strong feelings generated by her penis withdrawing into her body nearly overwhelmed her.\nAs she moved to Angara and then Liga, the milk continued to build and do it\u0026rsquo;s work. Galina could feel that she was now a woman internally, and her chest began to feel tender and swollen. As she put her hand to Liga\u0026rsquo;s breast, she could see that her hands had fully changed, each finger small and delicate, her index fingers had lengthened and were now her second longest finger. She gave Liga\u0026rsquo;s breast a light squeeze as she began to drink. After a few minutes, Galina could feel her hair pushing out from her scalp, and tickling down her soft, sloping shoulders. As she drifted towards MuSu, she could feel her budding breasts begin to swell, and as each spurt of his semen rushed down her increasingly eager throat, she could feel an echoing pulse push through her breasts as they grew. When she turned to the triplets, she was a complete woman, a strawberry blond match for Petra, with tremendously large breasts, a slim waist, and full rounded hips from which her shapely feminine legs hung, ending in small, delicate female feet.\nBarely able to concentrate, Galina hung in the water, feeling her now youthful and female body as the water and the mental focus of all the mers pressed in on her from all sides. As she turned in the water to face one of the triplets, she felt the delayed tug of her enormous breasts pull against her chest, and the water push between her legs, caressing her new vagina. Her long, hairless legs brushed against each other, and she felt her ankles touch, but water still flowed in between her thighs, her legs now separated by her wide hips. She could feel the still strong forces of the milk swirl within her body, and there were more mers from which to drink.\n\u0026ldquo;Galina, my sister, drink from me and receive your tail,\u0026rdquo; one of the triplets sang-Galina could not yet tell them apart. As she pulled on the beautiful breast of the blue and white-tailed mermaid, Petra and Xing floated further down in the water, and began to stroke her legs. Galina moaned into the girl\u0026rsquo;s breast, and began to feel the power for her ultimate transformation begin to build. As milk poured down her throat, she could feel her long beautiful legs stiffening under the ministrations of her soon-to-be-sister-wives.\n\u0026ldquo;Galina, my fellow scientist, drink from me and receive your tail,\u0026rdquo; another triplet sang. Galina vaguely remembered in her near trancelike state that Emma was the young scientist among the triplets. She tried to acknowledge this link, but she was unable to speak. Emma pulled her to her breast, and Galina drank. Her body had stopped shifting and moving as the power built for her penultimate change. Her legs were now frozen, stiffly pointing towards the cave floor, only a meter or so below her toes. Petra and Xing were still stroking her soft, feminine legs, humming along with the rest of the mers as Galina drained one and then the other of Emma\u0026rsquo;s breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;Galina, drink from me and receive your tail,\u0026rdquo; the last triplet sang. Galina could feel powerful forces gathering within her body, as invisible waves of energy rushed up and down her body. She could still feel the combined forces of the mers as they collectively focused their energies on her, and Galina could only manage a whisper of a thought towards her smarter brain. She drank from the girl\u0026rsquo;s breasts, and felt the power build exponentially. When she pulled away from the last of the triplets, her body and mind were fully in the grip of her transformation, and she could feel herself finally desire the final change that was to come.\n\u0026ldquo;Gabriel,\u0026rdquo; she sang for the first time into the water, \u0026ldquo;give me my tail!\u0026rdquo;\nPetra and Xing shared a knowing look as they turned Galina in the water to face their pod mate. They could feel the incredible forces locked within Galina\u0026rsquo;s body as they guided her stiff form to where Gabriel floated in the water, his long stiff cock pointed rigidly into the water.\nAs the beautiful Galina slowly floated towards him, Gabriel drank in the vision before him. She was nearly as tall as Petra had been before she became a mermaid, and her body was nearly identical, but there were some differences. Her pale reddish blond hair curled down to her hips, while her deep blue eyes shone with the power and passion of this incredible transformation. Her breasts were the same high, full globes topped with large, protruding nipples, and her waist was the same tiny circumference flowing out smoothly to equally wide hips. Her legs were now vibrating in the water as Petra and Xing guided their future sister-wife to his cock.\n\u0026ldquo;Come, my sister-wife, drink from me and receive your tail,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel sang in his rich baritone.\nWhen his cock slipped past her lips, Gabriel felt the most intense orgasm he had ever felt rip through his body. He arched his back as the waves of pleasure surged through his body, starting deep in his tail and rising up through his cock, and exploding again and again into Galina\u0026rsquo;s mouth. Petra and Xing left Galina\u0026rsquo;s rigid and quivering legs to help hold Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s arms steady as he pumped his seed into their newest mermaid.\nWhen Gabriel stopped spurting, Galina pulled back \u0026hellip; moaning. She felt her arms being pulled out from her body by some outside force, stretching them out horizontally, while her toes were stiffly pointed towards the bottom. She hung suspended in the middle of the circle, surrounded by the pods who were all humming a low tone into the water, their bioluminescence growing as the sensual power of the final transformation built. Galina could feel herself frozen in the water, her entire body rippling with the energies that had been fed to her by the fifteen mers around her.\nShe catalogued the feelings even as they rushed through her like a lover\u0026rsquo;s caress, each more pleasurable than the next. She knew her eyes were open, but all she could see was a beautiful mermaid with long strawberry hair, piercing blue eyes, large heavy breasts, and a sweeping maroon tail tinged with deep blue fringes. This vision seemed to float in the water as though a mirror was before her, and that image was slowly drifting towards her. She could still feel the others around her, supporting her, controlling her change, and \u0026hellip; a new feeling \u0026hellip; she could feel Petra, Xing, and Gabriel loving her. A love \u0026hellip; a feeling she had never before known, flowing through her body as the vision drifted towards her. The great waves of movement rippled through her body, building in intensity, her whole being was now vibrating with power.\nGalina felt a great urge to push, and she moaned loudly into the water as she pressed with her entire body, pushing down. In the middle of the push, she felt her new womb spasm with the most intense pleasure she had ever known, and as the wave of pleasure flowed down her legs, she could feel them knit themselves together into a single unit, thousands of nerves, blood vessels, and cells pulling apart and pushing together, waves and waves of energy pulsing through her legs and lower torso. Then she felt her still pulsing womb slowly sink down a few inches as her still new and unexplored vagina and other internal parts also moved forward and down. She could feel her gills tingling, her enormous breasts out thrust into the cool water, her hair flowing down her back, and she could feel the presence of the others, helping, guiding, loving. She could feel her entire body vibrating, filled with the power of the mermaid\u0026rsquo;s milk.\nGalina felt the need to push again, and so she did, and this time felt the bones of her legs break and fuse, merging into a new single structure, longer and fuller than it had been before. Her tail was finally arriving. It hurt as her bones reformed into multiple pieces, but the power of the milk made it bearable. Her bones settled into their new positions, and she began to feel new muscles snaking up from the bottom of her tail, up through her pelvis, anchoring themselves throughout her body. Thin strands of thread twisted their way up through her upper body, while in her tail, thick ropes of muscle throbbed and grew. She could feel new organs developing, as a sense of hollowness expanded underneath her growing dorsal ridge, and she felt herself become slightly more buoyant.\nAnother push, and she felt a tremor snake down her body, and felt her feet expand out into two enormous flukes that spread out into the water. Another push, and two fins pushed out from her mid-tail, and two more at her hips, each filling with bone, muscle, and nerves. The tremendous energy that had built within her body\u0026rsquo;s core now pushed outward, and her skin began to tingle and twitch. Another smaller push, and a hot tremor flashed up through her torso and flowed out through her arms. She could feel webbing form in between her fingers and new fins push out from her elbows, as new nerves and tissue filled them. She could feel these new nerves hook up with the rest of her body, and Galina understood where the mers' electroreceptor organs were located, along the trailing edges of her fins and flukes and along her dorsal ridge.\nAnother tremor bubbled up from her belly, washing up through her torso, neck, face, and skull. Galina could feel her skin changing, and a tickling along her tail told her that her scales were filling in, covering her lower body with color. Finally, a final push pulsed from deep within her, and her entire body convulsed, so strongly that she arched backwards in a great release of ecstasy. Her tail curled back above her head and quivered in the faint light of the cave. She found that her eyes could focus again, and she could see her dark, richly shimmering tail, floating a few centimeters above her head, now sparkling with its own bioluminescence. It was gorgeous, a rich, deep maroon that flickered with light, and her fringes were a rich, royal blue that she hoped would match changed her eyes. Suddenly, she was free from the grip of the transformation, and she relaxed in the water, her hair gently swirling around her body.\nEmma was wrong; it was better than any orgasm \u0026ldquo;he\u0026rdquo; had ever had.\nThe entire group floated wordlessly in the water admiring Galina\u0026rsquo;s beauty, her long and powerful tail that was now flashing and glowing in the cave as her newly born female passion began to build within her. She could feel many dramatic changes in her body, too many to catalogue. But even as she felt a new kind of horniness rise within her, she discovered that all her senses had improved, and that she could see all the mers more clearly. Already John and MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pods had retreated to various corners of the cave, and had entwined themselves together. Agba took Alexis' hand, and with Angara and Liga, he led them to another part of the cave where the three mers surrounded their new pod-mate, Agba\u0026rsquo;s stiff cock was clearly visible as Alexis shyly reached out to caress it. Galina was shocked to see everyone making love, right in front of everyone else. But that shock passed, as she recognized that her own passion was still rising, still building, and soon it would be beyond any control she might muster.\nThe combination of this realization with the new sensation of being able to \u0026ldquo;sense\u0026rdquo; her own new pod mates caused her to turn her attention to Gabriel, Petra, and Xing, who were waiting for her to recover, each of them filled with need and passion. Even as she recognized that she would lose this battle, Galina attempted to \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; her own changes one more time. As she quivered in the water, she extended her senses out from the cave to the surrounding sea, and found it strangely absent of fish. She could feel all kinds of smaller animals, but the larger fish were further away than she expected. This strangeness was something to explore later.\nGalina focused on her own tail, feeling the water moving over it. She finally dropped her hands to her side, feeling where her skin and scales joined, tracing the swells and dips of her soft, unnaturally smooth skin. She could feel where her hair brushed the top of her tail, she flexed her flukes, and they spread out below her like a Chinese fan, sending faint sparkles of color in every direction. She looked up and smiled at Petra, who was now approaching her new near physical twin.\n\u0026ldquo;You are beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Petra said softly, \u0026ldquo;so beautiful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I had good model,\u0026rdquo; Galina said in broken English, surprising herself with her new knowledge.\n\u0026ldquo;Your English will improve quickly,\u0026rdquo; Petra explained as she reached out to trace the swell of Galina\u0026rsquo;s large breasts. \u0026ldquo;And you will teach us Russian.\u0026rdquo;\nPetra ended the conversation and Galina\u0026rsquo;s attempts to catalogue the feelings of her new body by pulling her into a kiss. Galina swooned with the sensation of Petra\u0026rsquo;s lush lips sliding past her own, their bodies pressed to one another\u0026rsquo;s, their large breasts preventing their tummy\u0026rsquo;s from actually touching. Galina reached around Petra and tried to press their abdomen\u0026rsquo;s together, but their pillow-like breasts were too large. Galina didn\u0026rsquo;t mind, as the pressure of their beautiful, full breasts pressed into one another\u0026rsquo;s was nearly overwhelming.\n\u0026ldquo;But we won\u0026rsquo;t need words for a while,\u0026rdquo; Petra gasped, and kissed her again.\nGalina could feel Xing swim up next to her as Gabriel waited patiently for his wives to come to him. Galina could feel the passion that had been rising leap to a new level as Xing\u0026rsquo;s breasts brushed her elbow fins. She didn\u0026rsquo;t think her own breasts could get any bigger, but as Petra\u0026rsquo;s tongue swirled around her teeth, lips, and tongue, and Xing pressed herself along her side, Galina could feel her breasts tighten with passion, and her large nipples stiffened into Petra\u0026rsquo;s, the crinkly flesh twisting and turning as Petra ground herself against her new mate. Xing\u0026rsquo;s small hands were stroking Galina\u0026rsquo;s sides, running along her hair, and then Galina nearly exploded in an orgasm as Xing ran her hand lightly up her gills along her dorsal ridge.\nThat new lift in passion caused Galina to turn to Gabriel, whose cock was extended obliquely from his obsidian tail, pulsing with strength and power. Galina gave up all thoughts of ever being a man again, and pushed herself towards her new mate, filled with a desire she had never before felt. Petra and Xing swam quickly to stay with her as she made a direct line for Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s cock.\n\u0026ldquo;This Galina\u0026rsquo;s,\u0026rdquo; she murmured as she stroked it with her small hand.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s yours and mine and ours,\u0026rdquo; Xing corrected her as she resumed stroking Galina\u0026rsquo;s flanks and breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s plenty to share,\u0026rdquo; Petra said with a giggle, \u0026ldquo;trust me, I know. Go ahead, take a taste,\u0026rdquo; she urged.\nGalina looked up at Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s dark face, now softened by her new desire for him, and felt her heart quiver as she looked up into his flashing violet eyes. She looked back at the impressive cock that was centimeters from her face, and she opened her mouth, and slid her lips slowly over the glans of his cock, pushing back his foreskin with her teeth. After a few slow strokes, she lifted herself up and still holding his cock in one hand, kissed him for the first time.\nGabriel held Galina\u0026rsquo;s face gently in his large hands as their tongues danced together. She felt her passion build higher still as she felt his strong hands caress her ears and face as they kissed. She was dimly aware of Xing and Petra each rising along each side of Gabriel, still stroking her with one hand as they positioned themselves over his rising pelvic fins on either side. Galina guided his cock along her vent, feeling for the first time her swollen labia and clitoris as his stiff cock pushed through her furrow. She moaned into Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s kiss, and nearly swooned with lust. Petra and Xing steadied her, keeping her from slipping away from their quartet of love.\nShe broke from his kisses and looked down at her body, past her swollen breasts, her nipples tight and firm in the cool water, past her slender waist and flat tummy, to where she could now see her mons rising above the rest of her tail, eager and ready for Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s penis. She wrapped her tail around Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s, and began to aim herself for his cock. Once his head had pushed past her outer lips, she raised both hands to Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s neck, and looked deep into his eyes. Such pretty eyes, rich violet, shimmering eyes. How could she ever have feared this merman, she wondered.\nHe smiled at her, and began to push into her. Galina could feel the slow, steady power of his cock as it slipped into her molten depths. She leaned back, forcing her mons onto his advancing cock until a sharp pain stopped her. Her new hymen prevented her from further movement.\n\u0026ldquo;Go,\u0026rdquo; she whispered to Gabriel.\n\u0026ldquo;Go where?\u0026rdquo; he asked not quite sure what his new pod-mate meant.\n\u0026ldquo;In,\u0026rdquo; she urged, whimpering in her need.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah,\u0026rdquo; he smiled. \u0026ldquo;That has been the plan all along.\u0026rdquo; He pressed her head to his shoulder, gave a quick push.\nGalina stifled a scream as Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s powerful stroke ripped through her virginity and propelled his cock all the way into her body. She stayed rigid, pressed to his body, feeling his heartbeat against her breasts, her own heart pounding within, as his thick cock throbbed within her newly opened womanhood. After a few moments, she noticed that both Petra and Xing were watching her with lidded eyes, and then looked down to see each of their vents pressed against Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s vibrating pelvic fins. She became conscious of the vibrations that quivered along the length of Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s cock and how her own clit ached with pleasure.\nShe leaned back again, grinding herself in slow circles on his cock, slowly getting used to the feeling of this now welcome invader. She nodded her head after a few moments, and Gabriel reached down to her pelvic fins, and using them as handles, pushed her hips away from his. She shivered as she felt his strong cock slide slowly from her velvety grasp, and then gasped as he pulled on her fins impaling her to the hilt.\nThey began a rhythm, in and out, stroking long full strokes, as Galina felt her new breasts swell even further, and the whispers of an orgasm began to rise within her. She watched as Xing cried out, pulling herself lightly to Gabriel as milk spurted from her breasts, her face twisted in pleasure, her entire body twitching and jerking. Petra quickly followed, her enormous breasts filling the water with a cloud of white milk. Still, Galina felt Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s cock work its way slowly and gently in and out of her vagina, feeling the heat and tension rise. Soon, he was slapping himself against her, and now her clit began to throb, tingle, and buzz with each slap.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, uh, uh, uh,\u0026rdquo; she cried, as her body was filled with new sensations she never dreamed of experiencing.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Galina,\u0026rdquo; whispered Petra, pressing her own still spurting breasts against her new mate, \u0026ldquo;let it come, let it come,\u0026rdquo; urging her forward.\nPetra and Xing, now recovering from their own orgasms, shared a look, and then they each lightly stroked Galina\u0026rsquo;s gills together. Galina\u0026rsquo;s body imploded, and she arched her back against the incredible stimulation from her gills, forcing her mons hard against Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s cock. Her vaginal walls clenched around him as the spasms of her first female orgasm roared through her body, her breasts spewing milk into the water. Her eruption of milk was so thick and sudden that Gabriel could not see Galina\u0026rsquo;s face. Galina saw stars as she felt her body quake around Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s cock. Suddenly, his eyes flashed, and she felt his orgasm rise through his cock, through her vagina, and splash hotly, deep within her body. Her body crashed anew through another powerful orgasm, and she screamed her pleasure into the cave, not caring that fifteen other mers shared their space.\nWhat had she ever feared, she dimly though as she savored the long aftershocks of her multiple orgasms. If she had any inkling that this was what life as a mermaid would be like, she never would have let Alexander go first.\nTo be continued?\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/changes-in-paradise01-07/","tags":["mermaids","transgender","transformation"],"title":"Changes in Paradise: Part 01-07"},{"categories":["Mermaids"],"contents":"Homeland Security, US Navy, International Smuggling, and people who just love mermaids. The mers face new challenges and new mers.\nSeaman First Class Eric Edwards blinked back his fatigue as he poured through the complex spreadsheet that combined data from several classified military and civilian Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) systems for analysis. Algorithms that sifted through the millions of images of the earth noted 235 variances for the North American continent that were flagged as possible sites of increased drug trafficking or terrorist activities. He had made it through seventyfive flags in the past two days and had found nothing worth reporting. It was a tedious job, sifting through the satellite images, looking for the changes in human activity that had triggered the computer to signal that those locations should be examined more closely by specialists such as himself.\nEric didn\u0026rsquo;t consider himself a specialist. After several years of surfing and bumming around, working odd jobs, he had finally gone to technical school for computer programming, but dropped out when he couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford the tuition any longer. At twenty-six, joining the Navy had been difficult, but it gave him the technical training that he hoped would give him a career when he got out. The Navy did not, as he had first hoped with he enlisted four years earlier, keep him close to the ocean. He was stuck in an office building two hours from the ocean and another five hours from a decent surfing beach.\nHe stretched back in his chair, looking out from his cubical at the quiet hum of activities that characterized his otherwise normal looking office. The OHSCMCEOSDIS (Office of Homeland Security Combined Military and Civilian Earth Observing System - Data and Information System) looked much like any high-tech office in Northern Virginia, a booming suburb of Washington DC. If not for the smattering of military uniforms, a casual observer might think that the workers hunched over their desks wrote software. Eric took off his glasses, a necessary crutch now that he worked with computers, and cleaned them with a tissue. He replaced them and leaned to his left.\n\u0026ldquo;Lieutenant Commander Bennet?\u0026rdquo; he asked into the cubical wall.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes?\u0026rdquo; a soft voice responded, floating softly over the low wall that separated their cubicles.\n\u0026ldquo;How many?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Twenty-two,\u0026rdquo; the voice replied.\n\u0026ldquo;Seven PM?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe,\u0026rdquo; the voice hesitated. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got to finish thirty by today.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m at seventy-five,\u0026rdquo; Eric offered. \u0026ldquo;I can help you catch up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, that\u0026rsquo;s how you impress and seduce a fellow officer,\u0026rdquo; she teased.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not an officer, \u0026quot; he countered.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I know,\u0026rdquo; she teased. \u0026ldquo;Come and get a few, and I\u0026rsquo;ll take your proposal under advisement.\u0026rdquo;\nEric popped up from his seat and jogged around the cubical wall to the next entrance. A pretty brunette handed him a stack of folders as she smiled up at him.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re still working hard for a short-timer,\u0026rdquo; Sally teased.\n\u0026ldquo;I have other motivations,\u0026rdquo; Eric shot back. \u0026ldquo;Besides, you are technically only a week behind me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is IF I resign my commission,\u0026rdquo; she said with a smile.\nSally Bennett was four years younger than he was, but she had gone to college and was a Lieutenant Commander. She too was leaving the Navy, much to her father\u0026rsquo;s disappointment, but she was moving to Homeland Security, which kept her father from completely blowing his top. Her current job with Eric was part of her training for her new civilian career in counter intelligence. When she had arrived two months earlier, the athletic and friendly officer smote Eric with her first smile. They reported to different commanders, which they hoped would keep their relationship under the radar. They were well matched, despite their different ranks and educational experiences, and had similar interests and passions. Sally\u0026rsquo;s new job would take her somewhere else, but where they could not know. Eric had no idea what he would do when his time in the Navy was up. Despite those obstacles, their affair was a passionate one, and both felt the tug of something more serious, a tug that they felt sorely tempted to give in to.\n\u0026ldquo;Instead of moving to Homeland Security,\u0026rdquo; Eric suggested, \u0026ldquo;maybe you should come with me to California and learn how to surf?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I admire your persistence sailor,\u0026rdquo; Sally said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;Perhaps someday it will be rewarded.\u0026rdquo;\nSally was a petite woman with piercing eyes that danced beneath her rich, dark hair. She had learned how to scuba dive as a girl and was a natural in the water. She always resented the fact that the Navy didn\u0026rsquo;t allow women to become SEALS, as she could swim circles around most men she knew.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got four more weeks to make up your mind,\u0026rdquo; Eric offered. \u0026ldquo;My plane ticket for California is in one month.\u0026rdquo;\nEven at 30, the former surfer still looked and acted (when appropriate) like a beach bum, and sometimes, in the right light, he still looked like one. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you would totally love the feeling of being one with the water, feeling the power and rhythms of the waves,\u0026rdquo; he offered.\n\u0026ldquo;And I am sure that you would love scuba diving,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;They are both nice dreams, but you know how the Admiral has things planned out.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Admiral was Sally\u0026rsquo;s father, and try as she might; he was a hard man to resist. With great difficulty, she had tried to carve her own path, refusing to use her father\u0026rsquo;s reputation and influence to advance her own career. He nevertheless was a looming part of her life. When she had decided to resign her commission to move to Homeland Security, they had fought for weeks. Her father was convinced that Eric was to blame, that she hoped to follow him into civilian life. Nothing she could say could change her father\u0026rsquo;s mind, and he hung like a shadow over her relationship with Eric.\n\u0026ldquo;What area were you working on?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked, changing the subject.\n\u0026ldquo;North America. You?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;South Pacific,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Boring, eh?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, lots of hits in the Philippines, East Timor, but nothing we can identify as unusual,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll get started on these,\u0026rdquo; Eric offered, and he turned back to his own cubicle, five file folders tucked under his arm.\nPetra actually wished, in that moment, that she had never changed into a woman, or even a mermaid.\n\u0026ldquo;Aaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggg,\u0026rdquo; ripped from Petra\u0026rsquo;s throat as another contraction wracked her nearly exhausted body, her tail curling above her head, her arms clutched to her now swollen belly.\n\u0026ldquo;Do I tell her to breathe?\u0026rdquo; Gabriel asked nervously, looking over to Pat.\nPhoebe giggled.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Her gills are working fine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But there has to be something we can do?\u0026rdquo; Gabriel complained, feeling completely useless.\n\u0026ldquo;Relax,\u0026rdquo; Pat urged. \u0026ldquo;We all feel helpless, but this is something that mothers must do. We can keep her safe, and guard the birth, but her contractions make it too dangerous to get too close to her. She is cresting every few contractions to breathe air, so she’s fine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; complained Galina, rubbing her shoulder where Petra\u0026rsquo;s thrashing tail had walloped her earlier.\n\u0026ldquo;You were trying to help,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said, caressing her other shoulder, \u0026ldquo;Petra didn\u0026rsquo;t mean it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Galina said in the same ironic, monotone. \u0026ldquo;Still hurts.\u0026rdquo;\nPat smiled. Galina and Petra had become very close over the past several months, which wasn\u0026rsquo;t surprising given that Galina had modeled herself on Petra\u0026rsquo;s body, though her coloring was inspired by (his) own memories of (his) biological mother when she had been a male. Galina had been alone with Petra during the early contractions, before all the pods could make it back to the Moon Pool from all the different parts of the island. Petra would be the first mermaid to give birth, but she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the only mermaid mother for very long. Six other mermaids were now pregnant.\nAll four pods were gathered in the Moon Pool, waiting for the arrival of the newest mermaid. Petra\u0026rsquo;s long period of confinement was ending, and she had been in labor for nearly six hours. She had become pregnant with the only child of her now deceased pod-mate, Michael. Pat, Danni, Phoebe, Xing, Angara, and Liga were all pregnant now as well, but as with Petra\u0026rsquo;s pregnancy, none of the mermaids were showing any visible signs of pregnancy yet, though if Petra\u0026rsquo;s pregnancy was \u0026ldquo;typical,\u0026rdquo; all that would change in the last month of the eleven month gestation.\nMermaid pregnancies were apparently longer than human ones, but Petra had not gained much weight until her last two months, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until the last four weeks that her belly visibly changed. Her nipples had darkened as well, but otherwise, pregnancy did not seem to greatly alter Petra\u0026rsquo;s ability to swim, gather food, or any water-based activity. However, in the last four weeks she stopped leaving the water at all. It was just too uncomfortable to be on land, even lying on the beach was difficult.\nMoreover, the baby, as far as the three \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; scientists could tell—Pat, Alexis, and Galina were all well-educated scientists when they were men in their previous lives—mer fetuses did not curl up, as human ones did, but rather stayed lengthwise within the womb. Thus, Petra\u0026rsquo;s body had a long, modest bulge that extended from her sternum down to just above her vent, just shy of a meter in length. As she transitioned from her earliest contractions into the hard labor of one contraction about every two minutes, her tail had begun thrashing with the contractions, sometimes forward, but increasingly around her back. Her vent was dilating, and they could see flashes of lavender and black as Michelle\u0026rsquo;s tail prepared to emerge from Petra\u0026rsquo;s womb. Phoebe had worried that tail first was a breech birth, but Pat reassured everyone that marine mammals, which clearly the mers were, were born tail first.\nThe fifteen mers arranged themselves around the edges of the Moon Pool, keeping Petra from hurling herself against the rocks. Now, six hours later, it seemed like an unnecessary task. Although Petra was in constant motion, swirling in the water as contractions rippled through her torso and tail, Petra had never actually crashed into the walls or bottom of the pool. Galina had accidentally swum into one of Petra’s contractions, earning a stiff wack on her shoulder from Petra’s very strong tail. Petra crested the surface a few times, which gave everyone a scare, but she fell back into the water safely each time. There seemed to be an instinctual reserve in Petra that kept her from thrashing too far out of control.\nPetra had eagerly anticipated this day, but now that she was caught up in the struggle of actual childbirth, she wondered why. Her insides felt like someone had hooked up an electric socket to her womb and flicked on the switch every few minutes, making all her muscles clench and push down. She thought back to her own transition into a mermaid, and decided that the \u0026ldquo;push\u0026rdquo; she had to do then was nothing compared to this great effort now.\n\u0026ldquo;The tail is coming,\u0026rdquo; Pat exclaimed as she swam beneath the convulsing Petra.\nPetra arched backwards again into a circle, groaning her pain, her flukes stiffly quivering above her head, her now stretched open vagina pointed towards the bottom of the pool, trying to push little Michelle out into the world, into the family of mermaids and mermen who now populated this little island. Everyone could now see about ten centimeters of Michelle\u0026rsquo;s lavender and black tail, a dusting of dark green decorated the trailing edge of her 20 cm flukes. It was mottled, like the triplets, but with her mother\u0026rsquo;s and father\u0026rsquo;s coloring. It hung limply in the water, and Gabriel shot Pat a worried look.\n\u0026ldquo;Just be patient,\u0026rdquo; she reassured him.\nAnother contraction and the entire tail became visible, and Michelle\u0026rsquo;s stubby pelvic fins were now fluttering purposely in the water. Pat gave Gabriel a winning smile, and he smiled back, relieved that Michelle was moving on her own. Another contraction and her torso was visible up to her shoulders, and wisps of dark, black hair flowed down her back. Then, suddenly, a final contraction rippled through Petra\u0026rsquo;s torso and out squirted Michelle, her arms raised above her head as she eased into the water, a thin cloud of blood surrounding her. Petra sighed with relief as her body relaxed back to a straight line.\nPat quickly gathered up the two-foot long (60 cm) mermaid and got ready to bring her up to her mother\u0026rsquo;s arms, but little Michelle blinked, and squirmed free from Pat\u0026rsquo;s gentle embrace and headed straight for Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts, her umbilical cord still attached, trailing back into Petra\u0026rsquo;s vagina. Petra gathered her vigorously swimming daughter into her arms, and gazed in wonder at the beautiful creature she held. Michelle was somewhat rounder in proportion to an adult mermaid, less long and graceful, but her tail was fully developed, waving back and forth in the water energetically, her limbs and fins were clearly under her conscious control, her eyes open and bright, and locked in on her mother\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\nPetra swam slowly to the surface, the other mers following. Michelle gazed expectantly into her mother’s eyes, waiting. Petra, recovering very quickly from her painful contractions, pushed herself out from the pool and perched herself on a low shelf that was about a half a meter below the surface of the pool, the water reaching her belly button, but her head, shoulders, and breasts were out of the water. The rest of the mers bobbed along the surface, waiting.\n\u0026ldquo;Go ahead, little one,\u0026rdquo; Petra urged, \u0026ldquo;Breathe.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle gave a little cough, and took her first breath of air, wiggling her arms and tail in the simple joy of being alive. Her arms did not have the random movements of human babies; it looked like she was really stretching. She looked around at the pool, her eyes alert, watching everyone. She squirmed in her mother’s arms and flipped herself over pushing herself up onto Petra’s magnificent breasts. She found a nipple, and started to suck vigorously, staring into her mother’s eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, she\u0026rsquo;s got Michael\u0026rsquo;s eyes,\u0026rdquo; Petra sighed, inviting Gabriel, Xing, and Galina to come look at their newest pod member. \u0026ldquo;Just like I imagined so long ago. They are so blue it hurts.\u0026rdquo;\nGalina and Xing rose to either side of Petra on the shelf, while Gabriel leapt out and headed for the store of dried fish at the back of the cave. The girl\u0026rsquo;s all oo\u0026rsquo;d and ah\u0026rsquo;d at Michelle\u0026rsquo;s eyes, which were indeed, wide and blue, and her head was already covered in a rich, thick mane of black hair that reached to her tiny, chubby hips. Her tail was mottled, like the triplets, but hers was lavender and black, rather than blue and white, and her fins, flukes, and dorsal membrane were decorated with a light green fringe. As she tugged on Petra\u0026rsquo;s left breast, Michelle\u0026rsquo;s flukes curled under and around Petra\u0026rsquo;s right breast, brushing against Petra\u0026rsquo;s right arm.\nPetra would remember that first connection for the rest of her life. The feelings of motherly love, contentment, the supportive presence of all four pods as they watched the first moments of mother and daughter, the tug of Michelle\u0026rsquo;s tiny mouth, so unlike feeding other adults as they transitioned into mermaids or mermen, and the knowledge that the milk she was giving was now life giving, not tail giving. Petra felt the barest whisper of Peter, her former male self, rise up from within her memories, savoring this penultimate female moment of motherhood, feeling her magnificent breasts pump life giving food into her daughter\u0026rsquo;s eager mouth. Yes, she recognized, she was truly and completely a female now. She stroked Michelle\u0026rsquo;s soft hair, remembering the first moments she had first visualized the color of Michelle\u0026rsquo;s eyes three nights before Michael died, those same eyes that were now shinning brightly as the little mermaid sucked at her breast. Her daughter\u0026rsquo;s eyes were the same brilliant blue as Michael\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;Xing, Galina,\u0026rdquo; Pat prompted, \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s cut the cord.\u0026rdquo;\nGalina took the small piece of thread that Phoebe handed to her, and tied it around the cord where it left Michelle, while Xing tied hers a few centimeters out from Petra’s vagina. Once both were tied, Xing cut the cord with one of their surgical knives harvested from the submarine.\n\u0026ldquo;What about the placenta?\u0026rdquo; asked Petra, stroking her daughter\u0026rsquo;s hair as she suckled on her large breast.\n\u0026ldquo;Relax,\u0026rdquo; Pat assured her. \u0026ldquo;Normally it is expelled anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour after birth in humans. It should be similar for us. You\u0026rsquo;ll feel another urge to push or something like a cramp. It\u0026rsquo;s probably best to wait on this shelf and simply deliver it into the water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll start on the circulation,\u0026rdquo; Danni announced, taking on her increasing role as domestic goddess.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll help,\u0026rdquo; Cleo offered, and she joined Danni in swimming down the main tunnel. The mers had discovered that two well-placed mers near the front entrance could temporarily increase the gentle current that kept the water fresh throughout their system of underwater caves. The colder denser water rose up through the very large system of interlocking caves and pools towards the warmer interior of the mountain, but they could increase the circulation in the main tunnels and Moon pool by pushing water out the main entrance, rather than letting the mountain wick water up into the dormant volcano. When the Moon Pool was a bit too cloudy or the water seemed stale, a few minutes of strong mer-tail cleansing worked wonders.\nGabriel returned to his sister-wives and held Petra and Michelle in his strong arms. Xing and Galina each leaned back on Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s arms, and all four of them watched as Michelle fed.\n\u0026ldquo;You owe me five bucks,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, giving Pat a poke in the ribs.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t use money, goofball,\u0026rdquo; Pat said poking her back.\n\u0026ldquo;Michelle had a tail, fully formed, ready to go,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe countered. \u0026ldquo;You said she would be helpless, blind, and flailing, like human babies, unable to swim right away. I was right, and you were wrong.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alright miss-smarty pants,\u0026rdquo; Pat giggled, rubbing her own belly in anticipation of what was to come. \u0026ldquo;We are more like other aquatic mammals, like dolphins and whales, who\u0026rsquo;s young are born ready to go. What would you like instead of five bucks?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;First crack at John tonight,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said wiggling her eyebrows.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not my turn,\u0026rdquo; Pat teased back, \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s Danni\u0026rsquo;s, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have to ask her.\u0026rdquo;\nHank Connor scanned the island, searching for some sign of John and Patrick. His broad shoulders tanned by the sun, swung back and forth, while his now longish blond hair was gathered in a ponytail. He looked good for 47, and while he wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to win any body building awards, he had kept in good shape. Beside him, his wife Janice trained another set of binoculars on the island as well. Slowly they swept their gaze back and forth over the horizon, looking for any sign of human activity. Their colleagues might have hid on one of hundreds of small islands within a 500-km radius of the now inactive nuclear testing site.\n\u0026ldquo;It’s worth a closer look,\u0026rdquo; Janice concluded. \u0026ldquo;I don’t see any obvious signs, but there is enough canopy that they could be hidden in the jungle.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It’s better to check than to wonder,\u0026rdquo; Hank agreed, as he paused to look at his wife of twenty years as she searched the island before them with her binoculars. She was two years younger, and still trim despite three wonderful children, who where all helping on this trip. Hank had figured an \u0026ldquo;extended family vacation\u0026rdquo; was a better cover to search for their missing friends than simply leaving San Francisco for three months. He admired Janice\u0026rsquo;s long dark hair as it fell down her slim shoulders and toned body. Janice was a scuba instructor, and many hours in the water kept her in shape.\n\u0026ldquo;Robbie,\u0026rdquo; Hank shouted below, \u0026ldquo;Will you please hail the Sea Dancer and let them know we’ve reached 463.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Will do,\u0026rdquo; floated up from the hatchway.\n\u0026ldquo;If they weren’t such good guys, I’d have written them off a week ago,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;I almost wrote them off last year.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will find them,\u0026rdquo; Janice reassured her husband. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re not dead.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How can you know?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked. \u0026ldquo;You said the same thing last summer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I just do,\u0026rdquo; she said, still scanning the horizon. \u0026ldquo;Last spring we weren\u0026rsquo;t this well organized, we only had two weeks to look, and we didn\u0026rsquo;t have Bill and his crew.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It does help to have help,\u0026rdquo; Hank admitted. \u0026ldquo;We are covering twice as much territory in half as much time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And we have all summer,\u0026rdquo; Janice reminded him.\n\u0026ldquo;Not any more,\u0026rdquo; Hank warned. \u0026ldquo;We only have six weeks left.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Janice sighed. \u0026ldquo;But John is my brother-in-law, remember?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then we will find him,\u0026rdquo; Hank reassured her as he resumed scanning the island. \u0026ldquo;Or what\u0026rsquo;s left of him,\u0026rdquo; he thought silently to himself.\nJohn was Janice\u0026rsquo;s sister\u0026rsquo;s husband\u0026rsquo;s brother. Julie had married just out of high school, and her husband, Brian, was a cocky pilot for the Air Force. Brian\u0026rsquo;s little brother, John, had become a friend to Janice and Hank when he had helped on a Greenpeace mission nearly fifteen years ago. Over the years, Hank and Janice had mentored many young men and women as they learned to become activists for the earth, but John would always be their first. They would not easily abandon the search for him and his sidekick, Patrick.\nAfter a few more minutes, Janice lowered her arms to the railing of their sailing ship, Freedom III, a Martin 49 (15 m), resting herself as they cruised towards the small island with only a jib up, keeping their speed slow. She sighed heavily. They had been searching for John and Patrick for over nine weeks, methodically going through each of islands they had agreed, so long ago, that were the most likely sites to be both habitable and yet still yield enough evidence of environmental damage to bring to the World Court. They had only a few more islands marked on their original plans, but four of the six \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; islands that they had searched so far were not habitable, thanks to recent eruptions, earthquakes, or a lack of fresh water. If the primary target island, the first place they checked nearly two months ago, was not habitable, then it was possible that the two men had gone to an island not marked on their map. Or worse; they had died long ago. They only had six more weeks before they had to head back to California, so that the girls could start college in the fall. Rescuing in-laws was a hell of a way to spend a summer vacation.\n\u0026ldquo;How many more probable’s do we have left?\u0026rdquo; asked Janice.\n\u0026ldquo;Three, 463, 332, and 399,\u0026rdquo; Hank answered checking the heavily marked chart in his hand.\n\u0026ldquo;Sea Dancer confirms and will head to 332,\u0026rdquo; announced Robbie as he bounded up from below.\nRobbie was their eldest son, now twenty-two, had been an art major in college. Named for his maternal grandfather, Robert had favored his mother\u0026rsquo;s dark coloring and slim build. He was a dreamer, but a dutiful son, very much unlike his father, who had been a risk taker and troublemaker when he was a child. It had paid off handsomely, however, as Hank Connor had earned millions in the dot com revolution.\n\u0026ldquo;A week on 463?\u0026rdquo; asked Robbie.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, that should do it,\u0026rdquo; said Janice as she resumed scanning the island.\n\u0026ldquo;So, are we in for a day or two or longer?\u0026rdquo; asked Trevor as he stumbled up from the galley. He blinked in the sun and stretched his long and lanky body in a full body reach that sent his bones to snapping.\n\u0026ldquo;One week,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said, turning to greet the taller young man who slumped onto the starboard bench.\nTrevor Green was the boat\u0026rsquo;s resident geek, radio head, prankster, and a recent intern, as John had been so long ago. A strapping 25 year old, he had hooked up with Hank and Janice while he was still in college on a summer internship with Greenpeace. After graduating, he signed on as crew on their boat because they spent most of their time sailing along the California coast. When the call came for a \u0026ldquo;covert\u0026rdquo; search and rescue mission, Trevor was one of the few people Hank and Janice could trust. They were less concerned with discovery and more concerned about their twin daughters, Kate and Ann, who were both 17 and had inherited their father\u0026rsquo;s blonde good looks and rangy athleticism. Trevor was one of the few people the Connor\u0026rsquo;s had ever trusted around their daughters.\n\u0026ldquo;Why\u0026rsquo;d you let me sleep so late?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked grumpily.\n\u0026ldquo;Because someone forgot to wake anyone else up for their share of night watch,\u0026rdquo; Hank chided. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t stay up all night and still function the next day.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t, old man,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said good-naturedly, \u0026ldquo;but I can.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When you can beat him in a swimming race at 100 meters,\u0026rdquo; Janice teased, \u0026ldquo;then you can call him an old man.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Enough,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, kissing his wife gratefully. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get everyone ready for landfall.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sally,\u0026rdquo; Eric whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; she replied, ignoring his breech of protocol?\n\u0026ldquo;You need to see this,\u0026rdquo; he said tersely, unable to believe what he thought he was seeing.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be right there,\u0026rdquo; she replied.\nEric rubbed his eyes again but not from fatigue. He stared at the computer screen; the satellite image was slightly distorted from the extreme zoom his imaging program had created. Sally leaned over his shoulder and gasped.\n\u0026ldquo;Can you sharpen the focus?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve digitally enhanced this photo as much as possible,\u0026rdquo; he whispered. \u0026ldquo;Do I need to remind you that this was shot from a satellite 438 miles (705 kilometers) above the surface of the earth?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought these things could do license plates,\u0026rdquo; she complained.\n\u0026ldquo;Some can, but not the one that passed over this particular swath of the South Pacific,\u0026rdquo; Eric said, his fingers flying over his keyboard as a second image came into focus.\nThe shot showed one section of a small island. In the center of the shot was a curving beach that looked to be about 200 yards (183 m) wide, which only took up about two inches (5 cm) of screen space on Eric\u0026rsquo;s computer. In the center of the beach were four fuzzy humanoid shapes that appeared to be lying on the beach. Their lower halves were all brightly colored and vaguely fish-shaped.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not possible,\u0026rdquo; she whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; he breathed, not believing what he was seeing.\n\u0026ldquo;Have you crossref—?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; he interrupted, swiftly typing commands into his keyboard. \u0026ldquo;Here is a composite of images from the last two years. You can see similar patterns starting about a year ago: here, here, and here,\u0026rdquo; he said, his finger shaking as he pointed at the screen. \u0026ldquo;Just before that, there was this,\u0026rdquo; he said, as he brought up another photograph, \u0026ldquo;large group of men and a few women. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why this island hasn\u0026rsquo;t been flagged before.\u0026rdquo;\nThe two of them looked closely at the photograph, a large group of 20 or more were spread out on the beach while two large yachts were anchored in the lagoon.\n\u0026ldquo;They all look human,\u0026rdquo; Sally said.\n\u0026ldquo;But two months later,\u0026rdquo; Eric said, bringing up another photograph.\nOn the same beach, a similar number of figures were visible, however, their lower halves were brightly colored, sparkling in the sunlight, and vaguely fish-shaped.\n\u0026ldquo;Those cannot be real,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;They are real. There are too many sightings over too long a time to be faked. And that\u0026rsquo;s why the computer didn\u0026rsquo;t trigger a flag, it might not recognize \u0026ldquo;fish\u0026rdquo; on the beach as human activity.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not fish \u0026hellip; mermaids,\u0026rdquo; she said, barely believing what she was seeing.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; he whispered, his heart pounding, as he brought up the most recent picture. \u0026ldquo;Real mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Real mermaids,\u0026rdquo; she repeated, her chest rising and falling with her excitement.\n\u0026ldquo;A real merman too,\u0026rdquo; he said, indicating the larger, darker form next to the bright green, blue, and yellow forms.\n\u0026ldquo;When were these last two pictures taken?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Four days ago,\u0026rdquo; he answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Have you entered any protocols yet?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Seaman Edwards,\u0026rdquo; Sally said softly. \u0026ldquo;I order you to forget what you are seeing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Sir,\u0026rdquo; Eric answered, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;I want you to file all images, flags, documents, and references you have assembled pertaining to these records, protocol Blackgate,\u0026rdquo; she continued, her soft voice trembling.\n\u0026ldquo;That will erase all \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Eric said, confused.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s an order, Seaman,\u0026rdquo; she said tersely.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Sir,\u0026rdquo; Eric said reluctantly as his fingers began to fly over the keyboard, following the complex set of instructions for the Blackgate protocol. \u0026ldquo;I need the officer over-ride code.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Turn away,\u0026rdquo; Sally said, and she typed in a complex password. \u0026ldquo;You can finish now.\u0026rdquo;\nEric entered his own password, and then his finger hovered over the return key. \u0026ldquo;I have only two more weeks,\u0026rdquo; he said softly.\n\u0026ldquo;Trust me,\u0026rdquo; she whispered.\nHe turned to see her eyes twinkling, the smallest smile pulling at her otherwise blank and professional face. Holding her gaze, he depressed the return key. All pictures and records were erased, and the algorithms would now ignore any changes to this island. It was now a classified location; only a human intervention would pull up data on this island.\nPetra and Galina watched Michelle play in the tidal pool while Xing and Gabriel frolicked further out in the lagoon. Galina rested her head on Petra\u0026rsquo;s lavender lap, feeling Petra\u0026rsquo;s fin pressed into her own dorsal ridge. Michelle was climbing over Galina\u0026rsquo;s flukes as they trailed in the pool, while Petra enjoyed the warm sun that fell across her body. She savored feeling dry for the first time in months. It had been nearly two months since she had been fully out of the water for any significant period. Now, three weeks after her birth, Michelle was growing like a weed, putting on weight and length at an astounding rate, happily babbling and cooing nonsense noises.\nMichelle had been able to swim and feed right from the start. On land, however, her fins were a different story. Michelle looked and crawled with as much grace as any human baby. However, she rarely ventured further than a few feet from her mother, though she would stay with Xing or Galina without complaint while Petra took a break from feeding Michelle to gather food on her own, or to spend some \u0026ldquo;quality time\u0026rdquo; with Gabriel. Michelle wouldn’t drink from anyone else than her own pod-mothers, but she favored Petra, not surprisingly. Sometimes she fussed when Xing fed her, but Galina was particularly good at feeding Michelle while Petra and Gabriel made love or took some time to swim alone together, perhaps because Galina’s breasts were so similar to Petra’s. Everyone speculated on how quickly mermaids would mature because Michelle seemed to be developing at twice or even three times the rate of human babies. Everyone had also been surprised by how quickly Petra\u0026rsquo;s libido had returned, most especially Gabriel, though he wasn’t complaining. Xing, Galina, and Gabriel had fallen into an effortless routine of feeding both Petra and Michelle, and the other pods had helped, as they were able.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think you’ll want a baby?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked as she stroked Galina’s soft, strawberry red hair.\n\u0026ldquo;Someday, yes.\u0026rdquo; Galina answered after a moment, surprising herself. \u0026ldquo;After Xing delivers.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen she had first been faced with her transition, she had hesitated, and even secretly hoped that she would replace Gabriel someday. Now, nearly nine months later, she shuddered at the thought. She dearly prayed that no harm would ever come to Gabriel, and that she could remain a sister-wife to Petra and Xing forever.\nAs she lay with her head resting on Petra\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;lap,\u0026rdquo; she savored the wonderful feelings that her new body provided. She loved having Petra play with her hair, and she could feel Petra\u0026rsquo;s strong and smooth tail move beneath her head and neck. She glanced up and was rewarded with the impressive sight of Petra\u0026rsquo;s enormous breasts arching out into the air above her head. There had to be at least six or seven inches of breast, narrowing towards a very prominent and up-thrust nipple, now darkened by motherhood.\nShe glanced down, looking at her own equally impressive breasts, sloping down from her shoulders, the weight of her breasts pulling each nipple towards her sides. She hugged herself underneath her breasts, feeling her small waist, and forced her breasts together, each mounding up from her body, her own nipples were smaller and pinker than Petra\u0026rsquo;s but were equally prominent and stiff. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t see her own arms past the beautiful bulk of her breasts, and with her right hand she scratched her nails across the underside of her breast, watching the flesh move but unable to see her hand.\nGalina could also feel Michelle as she scrambled over her flukes, playing with her trailing fringes, running her tiny fingers along the bony ridges that gave each fluke their shape and support. Michelle\u0026rsquo;s warm little body felt good on her flukes, and she gently curled up the outer edges, cradling the infant mermaid in the center of her own wide and strong flukes. She raised her head up to look past her breasts and admired how beautiful Michelle was, her lush lavender and black tail nicely complimenting her own maroon and deep blue coloring. The bouncing movements of Galina\u0026rsquo;s flukes kept Michelle\u0026rsquo;s attention as she splashed and played in the water.\nGalina hugged herself tighter, feeling her strong stomach muscles tense as she bounced Michellein her flukes. She stroked her tummy and the line where her torso and tail were joined, enjoying the softness of her own skin and scales. She began to trace her nails up from her belly button to the center of her breasts, and then began to lift up her arm towards the peak of her nipple, but before she could reach her own nipple, Petra\u0026rsquo;s hand moved from her hair and gave Galina a gentle tweak, tugging on the large, pink nipple.\n\u0026ldquo;I hope Xing and Gabriel finish soon,\u0026rdquo; Petra said. \u0026ldquo;Then they can watch Michelle and we can have our turn.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Galina sighed, feeling her abdomen quiver in anticipation as her nipple stiffened even further in Petra\u0026rsquo;s grasp. \u0026ldquo;Our turn,\u0026rdquo; she whispered, reaching up to pull Petra’s other hand to her other breast.\n\u0026ldquo;These boxes can go over there,\u0026rdquo; Pat directed Phoebe, Emma, and Alexis to put the long box they were wrestling into one of the new \u0026ldquo;lab caves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There are two more boxes,\u0026rdquo; Alexis warned, pushing her end of the box out of the water up towards Emma, who together with Phoebe salamandered across the cave floor as directed.\n\u0026ldquo;Why didn’t you imagine mermaids who could have legs when they got dry?\u0026rdquo; asked Emma as she struggled with the heavy box.\n\u0026ldquo;If you tell me how to imagine the cell dynamics that it would take for such magic to work,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;If you had imagined magic, that might have helped,\u0026rdquo; Emma whined.\n\u0026ldquo;Magic would still require some sort of energy to work,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe prodded, \u0026ldquo;Sort of like you lifting your half of the box.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which I could do if I had legs,\u0026rdquo; Emma complained.\n\u0026ldquo;It would take less energy for you to lift this box than it would for you to transform your tissue and bone every time you got wet or dry,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe countered.\n\u0026ldquo;You’re a nerd,\u0026rdquo; Emma teased.\n\u0026ldquo;You’re still not lifting,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe shot back. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m pregnant, and I\u0026rsquo;m lifting.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There’s no more room,\u0026rdquo; Emma complained.\n\u0026ldquo;You sound just like your sister Cleo,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe teased. \u0026ldquo;Are you sure you\u0026rsquo;re not playing a practical joke on us by pretending to be Emma?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now that\u0026rsquo;s a low blow,\u0026rdquo; Emma shot back.\n\u0026ldquo;We wouldn\u0026rsquo;t confuse you with your sister if you stopped complaining and lifted your end of the box,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, stifling a giggle. She turned to Alexis. \u0026ldquo;Let’s go grab the next one,\u0026rdquo; she urged, and turned back towards the opening below that lead back to the Moon Pool.\nAlexis followed, watching Pat’s shimmering green tail flutter in the dim light of tunnel before her. The new network of seaweed lights were growing slowly, shimmering strands of bioluminescent sea grasses that Galina and Alexis had fashioned using mermaid’s milk as a catalyst for transgenic transformations. Thanks to the relative ease with which plant life was adapted by their new technique, namely using mermaid’s milk as primordial soup mix in which organisms were altered and joined until the desired trait appeared in a second generation. The large network of caves was now completely illuminated by bioluminescence.\nFor the past several months the five scientifically inclined mermaids had made great strides in adapting and using their secret weapon, mermaid milk, for a variety of new purposes. Their discoveries and inventions were greatly aided by the new equipment that the pods had slowly, but steadily transported from the Russian sub back to Mermaid Island. They now had fuel cells that powered their scientific equipment, which ran much more efficiently once Galina had used their mermaid milk to improve the efficiency of the proton exchange membrane inside each fuel cell. They had debated extracting the still intact nuclear reactor from the sub, but decided that they didn’t need electricity in large enough amounts to justify the effort and they didn’t want the increased danger of having the reactor on or near the island. Besides, it was too big to move with just mers pulling things along underwater.\nPhoebe and Emma were in awe of all the equipment on which they could learn and experiment. John and Patrick had brought some biological sciences equipment, scanners, microscope, etc., but the sub\u0026rsquo;s equipment was well beyond the scope and power of what Greenpeace could provide. Once everyone had learned basic Cyrillic, the equipment was not too complicated to use.\nSome of it had to be altered for mer use, however, like the larger microscopes that were a bit too tall for a salamandering mermaid to reach easily. John had built ramps that could allow the mermaids to reach the viewing lens without having to rise up on their flukes alone, which all of the mers could do for very brief moments, but their bodies were too heavy to be supported by only the bottom of their tails for very long. The younger mermaids spent hours gazing into the microscopes and bio-scanners, memorizing cells, molecules, and DNA strands. In fact, if anyone was puzzled as to where Phoebe or Emma might be, the lab was a good first guess.\nPat and Alexis pushed the last box through the water, back into the lab cave, holding it steady as they waited for Phoebe and Emma to finish stowing the second box at the back of the cave. The white-blue light from the LEDs they had strung together for this lab glowed brightly above them, while the pale green light from the altered sea grasses glowed dimly below. Only the lab cave had electrical lights, all of the mers preferred either their own enhanced sight, hearing, and mersenses or the bioluminescent lights the Russians had created in their own sleeping or home caves. The lab cave needed the bright clear light so that they could perform experiments and assess their data, and unlike the Moon Pool Cave, there was no sunlight or moonlight in this cave.\nThe new equipment that they were unloading was all fabrication machinery from the sub’s machine shop. When they had unpacked everything and set up the equipment, they would be able to weld, create bolts and other fasteners, and even cut steel. The first thing they were going to build was a variable buoyancy underwater sled. It had been hard work lugging back equipment from the sub, and some of the larger pieces had been dangerous to move, requiring two full pods, each working in perfect harmony, to get the large heavy pieces back to the caves. With the new sled, they could carry large, heavy loads over long distances with only one pod required to guide the sled.\n\u0026ldquo;Now we can start working on a new sled,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe gushed as she took her end of the box from Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;The next time we find a wreck that we can salvage,\u0026rdquo; Emma groaned as she took her end from Alexis, \u0026ldquo;it will only take a few days rather than a few months to transport stuff back to our island.\u0026rdquo;\nThe piece of equipment they most wanted to move first was the forward gun on the Russian sub. Despite Pat\u0026rsquo;s objections, Gabriel would have his weapon for protection, one that could rain havoc on anyone who was unwelcome to their island.\nLooking out from his office window on the 78th floor of the Petronas Towers, Malaki Dimaunahan felt both pride and frustration. He was proud of his far-flung business empire, which appeared to the authorities in Kuala Lumpur to be a legitimate import/export business. The vast majority of his wealth, however, did not come from the trinkets he shipped back and forth between several Asian countries and Australia, New Zealand, and South America, but rather came from his smuggling, prostitution, and drug businesses- for which his legitimate businesses was a cover.\n\u0026ldquo;Miss Chin,\u0026rdquo; he barked into the intercom on his shiny, black desk.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Mr. Dimaunahan,\u0026rdquo; an Asian accented voice replied in English.\n\u0026ldquo;Send for Tumibay,\u0026rdquo; he said softly.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir, right away,\u0026rdquo; the voice answered.\nIt had been a year since he ordered Alberto to lay low for a few months. After six months he got a bit worried and started looking for his cash to show up in strange places. After nine months, he had sent out discreet inquiries as to Alberto\u0026rsquo;s whereabouts. Now, the time for subtlety had passed. He needed to find Alberto and his money. If he didn\u0026rsquo;t, news of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s defection could inspire others to break free from Malaki\u0026rsquo;s control.\nMalaki walked over to the window and gazed down at the city below. Millions of people, from all over the South Pacific and Asia, seethed in the streets below. Tumibay would fly in from Fiji tomorrow or the next day, Malaki thought, fly back out to find Alberto two days after that, take a week or so to assemble and train a crew, and then another week or two to find Alberto\u0026rsquo;s hide-a-way, get Malaki\u0026rsquo;s money, and leave no loose ends. One-month tops, and Alberto would be history, and then news of his demise could be carefully distributed to keep others in line.\nHe was tired of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s recklessness, always in trouble with the authorities because he lacked finesse. Brutality had to be done delicately, carefully, so as not to arouse the suspicions of authorities whom you did not yet control. Malaki would miss Alberto\u0026rsquo;s special talent as a recruiter of prostitutes, who unfortunately did not last long in Malaki\u0026rsquo;s brothels. His clientele tended towards brutality as well, it seemed. He was confident, however, that someone else would rise to take Alberto\u0026rsquo;s place.\nMalaki turned to a wall safe, and opened the small, heavy door. He reached inside and took out a small radio-tracking device. He had waited until now to use the device to find Alberto because he risked tipping his hand to the rest of the thugs who worked for him. If word got out that there were bugs on each of his operatives' boats, then that advantage would be lost. It had cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to secretly install bugs on all those boats without detection. Now, with millions of dollars at stake, it looked like a good business decision to risk some exposure.\nTumibay would find Alberto and have Malaki\u0026rsquo;s money returned to him in a month. After that, Alberto and his ruthless gang would no longer be a liability.\nEric looked out across the plaza where he was drinking coffee, the \u0026ldquo;LA Times\u0026rdquo; paper opened to the classified ads. Young mothers with children in strollers chatted and played along the plaza where it dipped down into Lake Anne, business men and women bent over tables discussing charts, graphs, and papers, and an young girl played guitar on a park bench. Eric wanted to be depressed, but it was such a beautiful morning that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sad.\nHe had been depressed for several weeks—ever since that afternoon when he deleted the mermaid files, and Sally had stopped talking to him. She broke her dinner date with him that night, and the next day at work, she was busy in another part of the building. She remained unavailable the next day, and the day after that. Her only response to an email he sent her was one line: \u0026ldquo;Trust me.\u0026rdquo; He wanted to, but it was difficult. On his last day in the Navy, she came to his desk at the end of the day and offered him a handshake. She only shook her head softly to his raised eyebrow and left his cubicle quickly. Now, after two weeks waiting for his plane trip to become a reality, he was finally beginning to feel somewhat himself. For the last two mornings, he had come down to this coffee shop to by the out-of-town paper and scanned it for possible jobs.\nThe morning sun warmed his dark brown hair, and he returned to looking at the classified ads. As he scanned jobs that he really didn\u0026rsquo;t want, he wondered why Sally hadn\u0026rsquo;t returned his phone calls after she resigned. A mutual friend told him that she did, in fact, resign her commission. Eric hoped that she would make some time for him before she moved to her new job. If she was still sticking to her original plans, today was the day she was to start her training, and so he would never see her again. He had hoped or thought that they had shared something more, something that would require a goodbye at the very least.\nHe shook his head, and readjusting his glasses, he returned his focus to the newspaper. After a few moments of silent concentration, an envelope dropped from above his head onto his paper. Relying on his military training, he didn\u0026rsquo;t flinch. He pushed the envelope off the ad he had been reading, while noticing that return address on the envelope was for Qantas Airlines.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought you told me to forget everything—\u0026rdquo; he said calmly without turning around.\n\u0026ldquo;What was the latitude and longitude of that island?\u0026rdquo; asked a soft voice behind him.\n\u0026ldquo;I forget,\u0026rdquo; he answered with a slight smile.\n\u0026ldquo;I order you to remember,\u0026rdquo; the voice said.\n\u0026ldquo;Upon what authority do you so order,\u0026rdquo; Eric asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Upon this authority,\u0026rdquo; Sally said as sat in his lap and kissed him passionately for several minutes. Several times Eric tried to speak, but Sally pressed her mouth to his, twisting her tongue into his, nibbling on his lips, and holding his face to hers.\n\u0026ldquo;3 degrees, 23 minutes, and 51 seconds south, and 174 degrees, 40 minutes and 52 seconds west,\u0026rdquo; said Eric breathlessly when she finally let him go.\n\u0026ldquo;The plane leaves tomorrow morning,\u0026rdquo; she said, recovering from the passion of the kiss herself. \u0026ldquo;What do you need to travel to Fiji?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You,\u0026rdquo; he answered, reaching back for another kiss.\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously, we\u0026rsquo;re going,\u0026rdquo; she said standing up and straightening her skirt.\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously, you\u0026rsquo;re all I need,\u0026rdquo; he said, picking up his coffee and waving her to sit down. \u0026ldquo;My passport is current, I travel light anyways, and I\u0026rsquo;ve got all my discharge pay and my savings. I can throw a few things in a suitcase, and buy a surfboard when we get to Fiji.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How can you be so easy about all this?\u0026rdquo; she asked. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not complaining, but it seems so incredible to me. I treated you like shit for the past four weeks. Aren\u0026rsquo;t you going to ask me why?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No. You\u0026rsquo;ll tell me if I need to know,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;How do you feel about me?\u0026rdquo; she asked tentatively.\n\u0026ldquo;Then or now?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Both,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;We have something really special, like a perfect wave,\u0026rdquo; Eric answered slowly, thinking. \u0026ldquo;I guess I\u0026rsquo;m still something of a beach bum, just taking it as it comes, hoping for a good day on the water. I was upset for the past week or so that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even say goodbye, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter now; you\u0026rsquo;re here. Besides, you did ask me to trust you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are something special, the very last person I ever expected to meet in the Navy,\u0026rdquo; she giggled, leaning across the table to kiss him again.\n\u0026ldquo;Ditto,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;How much money do you have?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Now, that\u0026rsquo;s a personal question coming from a girlfriend who hasn\u0026rsquo;t spoken to me in over a month,\u0026rdquo; he teased.\n\u0026ldquo;We couldn\u0026rsquo;t risk being discovered,\u0026rdquo; she said earnestly, leaning towards him, her blouse opening to reveal the swell of her shapely breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;Discovered doing what?\u0026rdquo; Eric asked, trying not to look at her cleavage.\n\u0026ldquo;My father already blames you for everything, you know, resigning my commission, changing to a civilian job,\u0026rdquo; she said with a sigh.\n\u0026ldquo;I know all that,\u0026rdquo; Eric said. \u0026ldquo;Is that way you didn\u0026rsquo;t speak to me for the last month?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Partly,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;I needed to make sure that the last thing my father might suspect was that you were connected to what we are about to do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Eric,\u0026rdquo; she said, caressing his face. \u0026ldquo;I am asking you to help me run away from everything my family wants for me, and to help me to become a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Eric asked, his eyes flashing back to Sally\u0026rsquo;s. \u0026ldquo;You think you can become a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If they\u0026rsquo;re real, they had to become mermaids some how,\u0026rdquo; she argued.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, they\u0026rsquo;re real,\u0026rdquo; Eric reassured her. \u0026ldquo;Those photographs showed mermaids on that beach at least fifty times over several months at all hours of the day, and a few at night. No one stays in a mermaid costume that long.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then, Neptune or whatever or whomever can cast the same spell on me,\u0026rdquo; she said, with a far away look in her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;On us,\u0026rdquo; Eric said softly, taking one of her hands in his. \u0026ldquo;That was a childhood fantasy for both of us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; she said, remembering. \u0026ldquo;We discovered that secret the first time we made love. You wanted to make love in the water, but the pool was too cold.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too cold if we were mermaids and mermen,\u0026rdquo; Eric said, laughing. \u0026ldquo;But I am not ready to believe in Neptune or magic.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then how are there mermaids on that island?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; he said lightly, picking up the envelope and standing up. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go and find out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wonderful,\u0026rdquo; she said, springing up into his embrace.\n\u0026ldquo;Fifty thousand dollars,\u0026rdquo; he whispered as they hugged fiercely.\n\u0026ldquo;Seventy-five thousand,\u0026rdquo; she whispered back.\n\u0026ldquo;That will buy us some really good surf boards and scuba equipment,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Hopefully, we won\u0026rsquo;t need it,\u0026rdquo; she said.\nGalina and Petra floated in the sand bowl that lay in the middle of the south lagoon, the \u0026ldquo;mermaid’s lagoon\u0026rdquo; as the pods all called Pat and John’s original landing spot. The bright sunlight sparkled along their dark rich tails, still bright in the clear water of the lagoon, ten meters below the surface.\nGalina admired Petra’s flowing hair, her shapely shoulders from which hung two incredible mounds of feminine flesh, their large and dark nipples rising another two centimeters from her areola. Galina looked down at her own set of matching breasts. Her nipples were slightly smaller and pinker, because she had not yet become pregnant. But Petra’s breasts had not fallen or sagged in pregnancy, another benefit of being a mermaid, she supposed. Using her pelvic and mid-tail fins, Galina pushed herself towards her sister-wife, each fin swirling back and forth, like a Chinese fan dance, moving as slowly and as seductively as possible.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Petra urged. \u0026ldquo;Today it is my turn.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Galina said firmly. \u0026ldquo;You always give. Today, I will give to you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But,\u0026rdquo; Petra protested.\n\u0026ldquo;You know I am right,\u0026rdquo; Galina whispered as she began to slowly rub her body along Petra’s lush contours. \u0026ldquo;Now be quiet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ha,\u0026rdquo; Petra giggled as she felt Galina’s breasts brush against her tummy.\n\u0026ldquo;You know what I mean,\u0026rdquo; Galina admonished her. \u0026ldquo;You are allowed to moan only,\u0026rdquo; she said pushing her breasts into Petra’s small waist, using her tail to circle around Petra’s long and beautiful body. She felt Petra\u0026rsquo;s hand begin to stroke her tail as it slid past her fingers.\n\u0026ldquo;No touching,\u0026rdquo; she warned, as she felt Petra\u0026rsquo;s fin swing back to brush against her. \u0026ldquo;Fins too!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re no fun,\u0026rdquo; Petra whined.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll show you fun,\u0026rdquo; Galina whispered as she swung her own pelvic fin along Petra\u0026rsquo;s waist, rippling her fin against Petra\u0026rsquo;s hip like fingers drumming on a tabletop.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, don’t make me wait,\u0026rdquo; Petra complained, \u0026ldquo;No one but Michelle has kissed me since last night. You and Xing are each up to three orgasms since then.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I said quiet,\u0026rdquo; Galina teased as completed her first circuit around Petra\u0026rsquo;s quivering body. She lifted her face up and nibbled the underside of Petra’s overhanging breast as she curled herself around her lover.\n\u0026ldquo;Ohhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Petra moaned, feeling the tensions in her body begin to build as Galina expertly swirled around her body, brushing her with tail, fins, fingers, tongue, and breasts. Petra could feel her flukes begin to quiver, as her passion built within.\nGalina ran her fingers along Petra’s waist as she circled around her lover, tracing the changing contours of the shimmering line that joined her waist to her tail. Her fingers rose up slightly as the line arched up around the edge of her hip into Petra\u0026rsquo;s small waist, and she could feel Petra\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fins fluttering in the water as she passed by. Her fingers then traced the line back down slightly as it crested around Petra\u0026rsquo;s muscles that used to be her rear-end, and then sharply rising all the way up her back like a widow’s peak as it followed her dorsal ridge nearly three-fourths of the way up her spine towards her neck. There, just between her shoulder blades, an especially sensitive patch of forest green fringe marked the top of Petra\u0026rsquo;s dorsal ridge.\nPetra arched backwards, hoping to force Galina\u0026rsquo;s fingers to brush her sensitive fringes, but Galina held her course. She continued tracing her fingers along the line of scales and skin, following the other side of the dorsal ridge back down to Petra\u0026rsquo;s prominently curving backside. She was tempted to deviate slightly towards one of the two dimples that sat the base of Petra\u0026rsquo;s gills, above her tail, punctuating the small of her back. Instead, she followed the line up over the other hip, above her other pelvic fin, until it returned to the concave swell of Petra’s belly. Galina admired how quickly it had returned to its previous shapeliness after Michelle’s birth, and the way it was now jumping at her feather light touches.\nPetra was a bundle of nerves, all seeking release, her body consumed with need, at the same time she savored the slow, gentle seduction her pod-mate was forcing her to endure. Galina let her fingers fall down to Petra’s fins, and traced the dark green fringes along the trailing edges, watching as Petra’s movements became more frantic, seeking release from her slowly building seduction. She put her now slender hand along side Petra’s swollen vagina, her clitoral hood pulled back, the nub of her large clit exposed to her view. She could feel Petra’s heart beating, the blood flowing through her tail, and as she lay her head centimeters from Petra’s vent, she could see each heartbeat in the nearly imperceptible movement of her labia. Galina put her other arm around Petra, holding her tail gently to her body, her own breasts pressed around Petra’s tail.\n\u0026ldquo;Ohhhhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Petra moaned as Galina’s hand pushed over the top of her mons, causing her to arch her body towards Galina’s gentle pressure. \u0026ldquo;Uh, uh, uh,\u0026rdquo; she urged, \u0026ldquo;More \u0026hellip; more \u0026hellip; more,\u0026rdquo; she pleaded as Galina began making small circles with her palm pressed to her vent. Petra reached up with her own hands and began stroking her own breasts, pushing them together, remembering the days when she was a young boy, dreaming of a bra, stuffing his mother’s nylons in a discarded bra, wishing he had been born a girl. Petra ran her hands out from under her magnificent breasts to her nipples where Michelle fed every few hours, day and night, feeling her large nipples now dark and thick, poking into the water. She pulled on her nipples, rolling each in her fingers as Galina slipped two fingers into her vagina.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god YES,\u0026rdquo; Petra urged, pulling fiercely on her own breasts, moving her massive endowments back and forth in her grasp, feeling the water caress each breast as she moved them back and forth in the bright, tropical water.\nGalina savored the heat that surrounded her fingers, added two more to the mix, and moved her face to the top of Petra’s vent so she could begin to caress her clit with her tongue. She kept her other hand wrapped around Petra’s wide hips for leverage, and bore down on her clit, her tongue flicking and sucking her throbbing nub.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, mmyyyyyyyy goooooooooood,\u0026rdquo; Petra wailed, as an orgasm crashed through her body, her breasts now spilling milk into the sea. As soon as the waves of passion seemed to slow down, she felt Galina shove her entire hand into her, filling her up nearly as completely as Gabriel’s penis. Galina’s tongue returned to her clit, and Petra felt an even larger orgasm rise up from her depths and overtake her body. \u0026ldquo;Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, Gaaaaaaliiiiiiiinnnnnnna\u0026rdquo; she screamed, as waves of pleasure surged through her body, twisting and turning up and down her torso, pulsing around Galina’s hand, now trapped within her spasming vagina.\nGalina held on for dear life, feeling Petra’s cunt walls ripple over her hand, knowing and savoring the pleasure she was giving to her podmate. After many minutes of shaking and quaking, Petra finally calmed down. It was at that precise moment that Galina began to twist her hand back and forth, deep within Petra’s steamy depths, brushing the thick knob of nerves that was her G-spot with her knuckles and thumb.\nPetra lost consciousness after a few minutes, a smile frozen on her face.\nHank stretched towards the morning sky, pushing his toes into the cool sand not yet warmed by the sun. As he slowly went through his yoga routine, a sun salutation, he calculated how much time they had left. It would take them about three weeks to make the crossing from 463 to 399, and assuming it took another week to comb through that island, and assuming that they didn\u0026rsquo;t find any evidence of John or Patrick, that would give them two more weeks to make it back to civilization. The Sea Dancer was still at 332, as it was a much larger island and took time to comb through dense jungle that could cover all trace of human activity in a very short time. They could meet Bill and the others in Australia or even back in San Francisco.\n\u0026ldquo;Can I join you?\u0026rdquo; his son, Robbie, asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; he answered.\nFor several minutes the two men stretched, bent, squatted, stretched, and arched their way through the sun salutation together. From her vantage point further up the beach, Janice noted the way Hank made the exercise seem manly, while Robbie made it seem beautiful. Everything her son did, he made it into a work of art. Janice pushed aside the thought, which she did not think often, that Robbie\u0026rsquo;s gracefulness and beauty seemed at odds with his gender, which as far as anyone knew, was a straight male. Robbie had dated, but never very seriously. She had once confronted him in high school, hoping to support him if he was gay. He had only smiled at her, and thanked her for her love, but reported that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t gay. She walked slowly towards the two men in her life.\n\u0026ldquo;Do we ship off to 399 or do we head back to Australia?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;339,\u0026rdquo; said Hank in between stretches. \u0026ldquo;We should be able to be there for a few days, and then call in a seaplane for the girl\u0026rsquo;s flights.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The girl\u0026rsquo;s flights?\u0026rdquo; asked Robbie.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve decided that if we don\u0026rsquo;t find them on 399,\u0026rdquo; Hank said relaxing for a minute on the sand, \u0026ldquo;I think the four of us should continue search for another month.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Hank,\u0026rdquo; Janice gushed. \u0026ldquo;That would mean so much to me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Robbie?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a graduate, and currently unemployed,\u0026rdquo; Robbie answered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m at your disposal.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get everyone together, and get going,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, rising to embrace his wife.\nThe morning sun glinted across the sea, spilling across the eastern horizon, the impossible blue of the sky melting into the shimmering white-caped blue of the endless waves and water. The chug-a-chug-achug of the old engine throbbed in the vastness of the ocean, as the one-meter swells slapped against the old metal hull of the ancient fishing boat. One hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars might purchase a heck of a surfboard, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t go far with ocean going vessels, thought Eric ruefully as he trained his binoculars across the horizon.\n\u0026ldquo;Morning lover,\u0026rdquo; Sally said brightly as she emerged from the galley below, two mugs of coffee in her hands.\n\u0026ldquo;Morning sunshine,\u0026rdquo; Eric said, gratefully reaching for the steaming cup of joe. They had traded watches for the past two days, heading steadily but slowly for the small island in the vastness of the South Pacific Ocean.\n\u0026ldquo;That crazy old man was wrong,\u0026rdquo; Sally observed as she watched the sun rise over the water.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; asked Eric, slipping his arm around her slender waist, marveling again at the beauty and strength this smart and driven woman possessed.\n\u0026ldquo;The hunk of metal and bolts didn\u0026rsquo;t sink, and we\u0026rsquo;re not lost,\u0026rdquo; she said, checking the compass and her notes on the navigational map on which she had charted their progress.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but I did lose my glasses,\u0026rdquo; he noted ruefully.\n\u0026ldquo;I’ll tell you if there is anything interesting to look at,\u0026rdquo; she giggled.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you still think we got a deal on this hunk of junk?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Ask me tomorrow,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Why tomorrow?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Because we will be there,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;I hope those mermaids are nice?\u0026rdquo; he observed.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll bet you do,\u0026rdquo; she teased, elbowing him in the stomach. \u0026ldquo;Are you sure you don’t mean pretty?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I’ve lost my glasses, remember? Besides, you\u0026rsquo;re the only mermaid I want,\u0026rdquo; he protested. \u0026ldquo;More to the point, we only have ten thousand dollars left, and a short wave radio that might not work. If the mermaids don\u0026rsquo;t welcome us, we could be in deep trouble. Marooned on an island, with no hope of rescue, because no one in the world knows where we have gone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In two days, my father will have us tracked to Fiji where we bought the boat, and someone will tell him that we were headed north from there with a weeks worth of food and some camping equipment,\u0026rdquo; she answered. \u0026ldquo;If he gets really upset, it will only take about a month to have the entire South Pacific scoured for our bodies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Your dad will be upset,\u0026rdquo; Eric said. \u0026ldquo;You know that he will come looking for you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; she sighed. \u0026ldquo;But that just means that the mers will have been warned, and we will have joined them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t think we can just be changed into mermaids,\u0026rdquo; Eric worried.\n\u0026ldquo;Our satellites have been taking pictures of the earth for forty years, and really good pictures for the last twenty,\u0026rdquo; she argued. \u0026ldquo;If those mermaids had existed before a year ago, someone else would have spotted that pattern. We wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been the first.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps,\u0026rdquo; Eric agreed. \u0026ldquo;What will it be like, do you think, to be a mermaid?\u0026rdquo;\nSally thought for a long moment, finishing her coffee, watching the sea as it slowly slid by their old, slow boat.\n\u0026ldquo;It will be like diving, I hope, only better. We will float in a world of beauty without worrying about air, feeling the water caress our bodies like a lover,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;It would mean that I could simply be, be \u0026hellip; simple, in a way, instead of always feeling like I had to do things to please my father.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What kind of mermaid do you want to be?\u0026rdquo; he asked, stroking her waist.\n\u0026ldquo;A pretty one that you like,\u0026rdquo; she said, leaning back into him.\n\u0026ldquo;What does a pretty mermaid look like?\u0026rdquo; he prodded.\n\u0026ldquo;She would have brown hair and brown eyes, slim shoulders, breasts slightly larger than my own \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yours are perfect,\u0026rdquo; he said, lifting one hand to gently cup her B cup breast.\n\u0026ldquo;Keep doing that,\u0026rdquo; she murmured.\n\u0026ldquo;But what would your mermaid part look like?\u0026rdquo; he reminded her.\n\u0026ldquo;My tail would be long and strong, with wide flukes, colored like a neon damsel, you know, the small tropical fish?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, what\u0026rsquo;s a neon damsel look like?\u0026rdquo; he asked, still stroking her breast, feeling her nipple harden under his fingers through her tee shirt.\n\u0026ldquo;Their tails are a deep royal blue, but not dark, shimmering with lighter blues and highlighted with silver edges,\u0026rdquo; she answered, her breath quickening as she imagined herself as a mermaid. \u0026ldquo;And it would be graceful and beautiful to see flashing in the sea or curled around yours.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What will my tail be like?\u0026rdquo; he asked, feeling himself become aroused by Sally\u0026rsquo;s obvious passion and the erotic possibilities of becoming something else, a creature of myth and magic.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; she squealed as she felt Eric\u0026rsquo;s rising penis brush her hip. \u0026ldquo;Let me look at you and see what it ought to look like.\u0026rdquo; She turned in his grasp, her back to the gunwale, the rising sun glowing through her hair. She pulled her tee shirt off with a single motion, setting her small but shapely breasts free in the morning air, their dark brown nipples crinkling up and jutting forward.\n\u0026ldquo;Take off your pants,\u0026rdquo; she urged as she tugged open her own shorts and pushed them off.\nEric quickly freed himself of his clothes and gathered Sally into his arms. His now stiff cock pressing against her belly, her breasts pressing into his ribs as her head rested on his chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Your tail,\u0026rdquo; she said, pushing her body into his, rubbing her breasts on his body, and pressing her belly along the length of his cock. \u0026ldquo;Your tail should be the same, don\u0026rsquo;t you think?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why the same?\u0026rdquo; he asked as he stroked her rounded ass, feeling her soft skin beneath his fingers.\n\u0026ldquo;Uugh, that feels good,\u0026rdquo; she hissed as his strong and broad hands kneaded her butt. \u0026ldquo;Because we will be mates,\u0026rdquo; she said as she reached between them to guide his stiff penis towards her crotch.\n\u0026ldquo;Mates,\u0026rdquo; Eric said, savoring the sound. \u0026ldquo;Not husband and wife?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No: mates,\u0026rdquo; she answered as she rubbed the tip of his cock along the length of her wet slit. \u0026ldquo;Remember, we are running away from all that middle class crap? Now, lie back on the deck,\u0026rdquo; she ordered. \u0026ldquo;I want to make love like a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\nEric sank to the deck, lying on his back, feeling the warm deck on his back. Sally followed him down and laid her body on his, her hand guiding his cock between her legs. She trapped him between her thighs, her juices lubricating him as she ground her legs against his, her toes reaching to his ankles.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t move your legs,\u0026rdquo; she whispered. \u0026ldquo;Pretend you already have a tail.\u0026rdquo;\nShe moved forward so that Eric\u0026rsquo;s natural angle was working to her advantage, and then slowly twirled her hips until the tip of his cock had lodged itself between her swollen pussy lips.\n\u0026ldquo;Imagine our bright, colorful tails entwined with each other, floating in the warm tropical water, and then \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she said as she sank herself onto his cock, her legs sliding along his as she pushed herself down on his cock.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhhhh,\u0026rdquo; he groaned as she lowered her upper body down to his, her breasts flattening out against him. He brought his hands up to her hips and helped her slowly move up and down along his cock, keeping her breasts pressed to his chest and her feet pressed to his ankles. He held his legs tight, straight, and stiff, feeling the slippery, warm, wet junction where their bodies were joined. He could feel her internal muscles begin to twitch as her orgasm quickly built up steam.\n\u0026ldquo;Your tail is quivering with need,\u0026rdquo; he whispered, pressing her hips into his own. \u0026ldquo;Your flukes are spreading out like a peacock\u0026rsquo;s tail, full of blue’s and greens, flecked with silver.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ohhhhhh, God,\u0026rdquo; she moaned as her orgasm crashed through her body, her vagina clutching at Eric\u0026rsquo;s penis as her thighs quivered stiffly along Eric\u0026rsquo;s outstretched legs. \u0026ldquo;So, goooooood \u0026hellip; sooo good,\u0026rdquo; she whimpered, her breasts pressed into his chest, her mouth buried in his neck.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhhhh,\u0026rdquo; groaned Eric as his orgasm ripped up from his crotch, splashing hotly in Sally\u0026rsquo;s depths, their legs both quivering with the restraint of pretending to be tails.\nAs they lay there recovering, the engine began to sputter.\n\u0026ldquo;Damn, we have to switch gas tanks,\u0026rdquo; Eric muttered.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we must,\u0026rdquo; Sally lamented, reluctantly pulling herself off her lover. \u0026ldquo;Is this the last one?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we should have just enough gas to reach the island,\u0026rdquo; he answered, not bothering to put his swimsuit back on as he headed for the stern. \u0026ldquo;If those mermaids don\u0026rsquo;t like us, we\u0026rsquo;ll be stuck because we will be out of gas.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A boat?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; answered Agba, \u0026ldquo;and headed this way. Angara thought she sensed something new in the water, and it was the boat. We caught up to it early this morning, and it is headed directly for this island.\u0026rdquo;\nAgba\u0026rsquo;s pod had been out for the past two days searching to the southwest for new shipwrecks and continuing the careful mapping the surrounding sea floor. The four of them had rushed back once they had triangulated the boat\u0026rsquo;s movements and determined that it was headed straight for the island.\n\u0026ldquo;What kind of a boat?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;A old fishing boat,\u0026rdquo; Liga answered. \u0026ldquo;The Maria, out of Suva, Fiji.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Only two on board, we think,\u0026rdquo; Agba continued. \u0026ldquo;We didn\u0026rsquo;t want to get too close and be spotted. They looked like a young couple, Caucasian, not native fishermen at all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe they are honeymooners who got lost?\u0026rdquo; Alexis offered.\n\u0026ldquo;No honeymooner would leave Fiji in an old fishing boat by themselves,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe stated.\n\u0026ldquo;No honeymooner puts a boat that old on a dead reckon for this island,\u0026rdquo; Pat said thinking. \u0026ldquo;They know where they are headed, just like John and I did.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; John offered. \u0026ldquo;We need to plan a welcome for our guests.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We need to hurry,\u0026rdquo; Agba said. \u0026ldquo;They will be here by mid-day.\u0026rdquo;\nThe lagoon was beautiful, the white sand stretching out like lovers arms, enfolding the clear, sparkling blue water. The small volcano looked inactive, and the jungle seemed lush and fruitful. The small beach huts at the edge of the jungle looked sound, and recently fixed.\n\u0026ldquo;If we\u0026rsquo;re stuck, we could do a lot worse,\u0026rdquo; Sally observed sat down next to the hut with a sigh.\n\u0026ldquo;We are definitely not the first ones here,\u0026rdquo; Eric observed, looking out over the lagoon. \u0026ldquo;Look, there\u0026rsquo;s a radio mast over there, about one hundred yards out,\u0026rdquo; he said, pointing.\n\u0026ldquo;Should we get back to the boat and check it out?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We are here for the mermaids, not the boat,\u0026rdquo; Eric said.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you see any mermaids?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Only one,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Where?!\u0026rdquo; she asked excitedly, scanning the lagoon.\n\u0026ldquo;Right there,\u0026rdquo; he said, pointing at her.\n\u0026ldquo;Will you stop,\u0026rdquo; she pouted. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve been here all afternoon, searched over half the island, and we haven\u0026rsquo;t seen a single mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; he said, sitting down next to her. \u0026ldquo;Maybe we just have to wait.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just getting frustrated,\u0026rdquo; she complained.\n\u0026ldquo;I know, but we don\u0026rsquo;t even know if the mermaids speak English,\u0026rdquo; he said.\nSally seemed to sense something, and lifted her head, trying to orient her hearing.\n\u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; Eric asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; she said, as she rose to her feet, and walked down the beach to the water. Eric followed her. She stood at the edge of the water, her hands on her hips, her brown hair fluttering in the late afternoon breeze. Their boat was anchored only a few yards off the beach, and they had swum ashore because they lacked a dinghy.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey listen you mermaids and mermen,\u0026rdquo; she shouted into the air. \u0026ldquo;I just want to become a mermaid too!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, why didn\u0026rsquo;t you just say so sooner,\u0026rdquo; Pat said brightly, poking her head around the edge of the boat, causing both Sally and Eric to jump back in surprise.\nThe two humans watched with awe as a small group of mers emerged from behind their boat and began to swim gracefully towards the shore. As they salamandered up the beach, Sally and Eric slowly backed away, giving them room to arrange themselves in a semi-circle before the two of them. They noticed that the mermaids seemed particularly ungainly on land, but the merman seemed very agile.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m Pat,\u0026rdquo; the one with the green tail began, \u0026ldquo;and this is my pod, John, Danni, and Phoebe,\u0026rdquo; she continued, indicating each.\n\u0026ldquo;Pod?\u0026rdquo; asked Eric.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a long story,\u0026rdquo; John said, offering his hand to Eric, who took it gingerly. \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you tell us about yourselves, and then we can talk about us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, you erased all records of us from the system?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, as she watched the stars begin to twinkle in the evening sky.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Sally answered, beginning to lose her voice after hours of answering and asking questions. \u0026ldquo;I knew that if we made an official report, we would never have this opportunity.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we don\u0026rsquo;t know how long this window will be open,\u0026rdquo; Eric said. \u0026ldquo;It will only be a matter of time before someone else spots the unusual features of this island.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because her father will see to that,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry to put you all in danger like that,\u0026rdquo; Sally said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just that I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to be a mermaid, ever since I was a little girl.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you\u0026rsquo;re with her on this one?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Eric answered, taking Sally\u0026rsquo;s hand in his own.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we knew that someone would eventually discover us, and we\u0026rsquo;ve tried to become better prepared,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Maybe having a member of the family, so to speak, well placed in the American Navy would be to our advantage.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Sally offered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure my father would do what he could to insure that we could be undisturbed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not,\u0026rdquo; John said.\n\u0026ldquo;Neither am I,\u0026rdquo; said Danni. \u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t think that should be the reason we say no to Sally and Eric.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What reason is there?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;No reason,\u0026rdquo; Danni said. \u0026ldquo;I think the more mers we have, from more places, the less likely it will be that anyone of us will be targets for circus or exploitation or extermination.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She has a point,\u0026rdquo; Sally added. \u0026ldquo;The more mers there are, the less likely that we can be wiped out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You both realize that we don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand the transformation ourselves,\u0026rdquo; Pat warned. \u0026ldquo;That there may be consequences that we don\u0026rsquo;t yet know about?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Sally answered. \u0026ldquo;But the chance to achieve a life-long dream is worth that risk.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then wait here,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;We will be back in the morning after we talk to the others.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Others?\u0026rdquo; asked Sally. \u0026ldquo;How many others are there?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will see you in the morning,\u0026rdquo; John said firmly, as the four mers waddled back into the water.\nSally and Eric watched as the mers slipped into the sea, the moonlight sparkling along their shimmering tails. A few yards out, the golden blond mermaid surfaced and gave them a big thumbs up. \u0026ldquo;Keep cool,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;It will work out in the morning,\u0026rdquo; as she disappeared back beneath the waves with a flick of her tail.\nTumibay stood firmly on the bridge of his sleek and powerful yacht, the wind rushing over his shiny, bald, head. His crew of six, hand picked men from his own family scurried around the boat as it roared through the water. In the morning, if the data from the tracking device was accurate, they would find Alberto. Tumibay didn\u0026rsquo;t like technological gadgets much, but the South Pacific was too big a place to simply go searching for a misplaced pearl. Not that Alberto was a pearl, but the five million American dollars was a worthy pearl. Perhaps Malaki would let him keep some as a reward for so neatly tying up all these loose ends.\nIt would have never occurred to him to think that Malaki wouldn\u0026rsquo;t value his work, or that he, himself, might someday become a \u0026ldquo;loose end.\u0026rdquo; No, Tumibay was a good and loyal employee, and he enjoyed his work. That was the feature that most scared people who knew him; Tumibay really, really loved his work. He loved thinking about killing, planning how to kill, and planning on how not to get caught killing.\nHe lovingly reviewed his plans for the next killing as he stood on the dark deck, the ocean spray misting in his face. When they got within a few hours of the signal, they send word of their position back to Malaki, use the sea anchor and wait until nightfall, slip into their scuba suits, and sneak up to the island under the cover of darkness. He fingered the knife he always wore hidden on his thigh. Strength, stealth, and steel—that\u0026rsquo;s what Tumibay understood. Silent steel, sharp steel, cold steel—it could solve problems that a loud, hot bullet could not. Mostly, it could kill.\nThe decision had been quicker than Pat thought. The pods all agreed that they should add Sally and Eric, the sooner the better. The question was how and when.\n\u0026ldquo;If they were still human, they could help set up the gun,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said.\n\u0026ldquo;If we need them to set it up, how are we going to operate it once it is set up?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;The gun is automated,\u0026rdquo; Alexis explained. \u0026ldquo;We would operate it from the lab via computer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we need to run wires, power, and a targeting device,\u0026rdquo; said Gabriel. \u0026ldquo;They would be useful during that stage.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They are people, with dreams and hopes and desires, who are soon to be mers, if we ever get our act together,\u0026rdquo; Pat reminded everyone testily. \u0026ldquo;Not useful tools to help us set up a gun.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; said Gabriel sheepishly. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean it that way. We can do it ourselves, but it will take John and I three times as long to run cables as it would for Eric to do it by himself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we be back at the beach, talking to Eric and Sally about all this?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni. \u0026ldquo;They don\u0026rsquo;t even know about all of you yet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s right,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, putting a calming hand on her pod-mate\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. \u0026ldquo;We won\u0026rsquo;t have the gun here for many weeks, and I think they should be able to decide if they want to remain human while we build the sled and salvage the gun.\u0026rdquo;\nTumibay trained his telescope on the island in the far distance, a blue haze hovering around the volcano in the early morning light. He knew that if he could see the island, then Alberto might be able to see him. He would wait. In the meantime, there was equipment to be checked, reports to be radioed back, plans to be made, and knives to be sharpened.\nThe mers had all introduced themselves over breakfast, which consisted of a mix of the supplies Sally and Eric had brought and fresh fish and seaweed from the sea.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought I would miss this stuff,\u0026rdquo; Danni mused as she crunched on a piece of chocolate. \u0026ldquo;But it’s not that good.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes it is! I do miss this stuff,\u0026rdquo; Rikki complained as she looked longingly at the last pieces of chocolate disappear into her sisters' mouths. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you have any more?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, Cleo,\u0026rdquo; Sally said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s all we brought.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m Cleo,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s Rikki, and thanks for the chocolate. It\u0026rsquo;s been ages.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, Sally\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;When you become a mermaid, we\u0026rsquo;re easy to tell apart.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, um, Emma, right?\u0026rdquo; asked Sally.\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;Thanks from me too,\u0026rdquo; she said licking her fingers, \u0026ldquo;for the chocolate.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Have you made a decision?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat. \u0026ldquo;About when you would like to transition?\u0026rdquo;\nEric and Sally looked briefly at each other before turning to Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Can we have the day to think about it?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Take as long as you like,\u0026rdquo; Danni urged. \u0026ldquo;After all, there\u0026rsquo;s no going back.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That we are aware of,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe observed quietly.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve never tried,\u0026rdquo; said Phoebe. \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know if we can go the other way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not going to try,\u0026rdquo; said Danni, stroking her pelvic fins. \u0026ldquo;I am staying exactly as I am.\u0026rdquo;\nThe other mers joined in a similar chorus.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that you should,\u0026rdquo; said Phoebe. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m only saying we don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s possible.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As interesting as such speculations might be,\u0026rdquo; Pat interrupted. \u0026ldquo;Some of us are pregnant and uncomfortable on this beach. Besides, there\u0026rsquo;s work to be done while we wait for Eric and Sally to make up their minds.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Work?\u0026rdquo; Cleo complained.\n\u0026ldquo;We need to harvest their boat for useful equipment, the remaining gasoline, and then tow it out into the ocean and sink it,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained.\n\u0026ldquo;Gabriel, Galina, why don\u0026rsquo;t you join Pat and I on the boat,\u0026rdquo; John suggested. \u0026ldquo;We can salvage the equipment while MuSu and the rest of the girls shuttle it back to the beach. Agba, why don\u0026rsquo;t you take your pod out to the reef and keep watch?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think you two boys can handle the boat, while Pat and I collect food for dinner,\u0026rdquo; Galina said as she watched Pat waddle down to the water. \u0026ldquo;I think Pat will be more comfortable in the water.\u0026rdquo;\nEric and Sally walked back down the jungle path towards the beach huts where the mers were now gathered. They had spent the rest of the day moving their radio, parts of the engine and boat that might be useful, and the remaining gallons of gasoline up to the chimney near the old hot tub and lowering them down to the mers below. The sky was now dark, and the stars were beginning to come out. They could see the shimmering tails of the mers on the beach. It was a beautiful sight, but it was also plainly visible, especially to a seaplane that might be searching for an Admiral\u0026rsquo;s daughter.\n\u0026ldquo;It will be only a matter of time before we are spotted,\u0026rdquo; Sally mused.\n\u0026ldquo;You said we,\u0026rdquo; Eric noted.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I guess I did,\u0026rdquo; Sally said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to be a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When?\u0026rdquo; asked Eric. \u0026ldquo;We need to tell them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, part of me says now,\u0026rdquo; she said with a sigh. \u0026ldquo;But I know that we can help prepare this island for unwelcome visitors if we wait.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, we wait?\u0026rdquo; asked Eric.\n\u0026ldquo;We become a team player,\u0026rdquo; Sally concluded.\n\u0026ldquo;I love you,\u0026rdquo; Eric said, planting a kiss on her lips. \u0026ldquo;Besides, if we wait, we get to be alone for a while longer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s so special about that?\u0026rdquo; teased Sally.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll show you after the mers go back to their caves,\u0026rdquo; Eric promised, wiggling his eyebrows.\n\u0026ldquo;So, we will do what ever is best for everyone,\u0026rdquo; Sally finished.\n\u0026ldquo;We are not certain that waiting is best,\u0026rdquo; Pat offered. \u0026ldquo;But it would be useful,\u0026rdquo; she finished with a wry glance at Gabriel.\n\u0026ldquo;We really appreciate your help,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel added. \u0026ldquo;Your experience in the Navy will be an asset as to where we should set up things, and stuff like that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We weren\u0026rsquo;t trained in artillery,\u0026rdquo; Eric offered. \u0026ldquo;We were computer geeks, or at least I was.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;All officers have some training in basic Navy tactics,\u0026rdquo; Sally said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll do what I can to help.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A Navy officer as a mermaid, who would have dreamed of such a thing,\u0026rdquo; Danni exclaimed, rubbing her belly. \u0026ldquo;Oh, Petra, I am beginning to understand why you stopped coming out of the water in your last month.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How close are you?\u0026rdquo; asked Sally.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re nine months, nineteen days, and two hours pregnant,\u0026rdquo; stated Phoebe. \u0026ldquo;But we think gestation is eleven months.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How can you be so sure, right down to the hour, but not know how long gestation is?\u0026rdquo; asked Sally.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a long story,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, \u0026ldquo;that we can share with you later. For now, we all ought to get some rest, and we need to take over from Agba\u0026rsquo;s pod.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We can do it,\u0026rdquo; Emma offered, as Cleo groaned. \u0026ldquo;None of us are pregnant,\u0026rdquo; she said as she shot a look at her sister, \u0026ldquo;and we\u0026rsquo;re not that tired.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Speak for yourself,\u0026rdquo; Cleo complained.\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, Emma,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll remember this one, I promise. Tell Agba to bring his pod back to the beach. We can spend the night here with our new guests.\u0026rdquo;\nSuddenly all the mers stiffened.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; asked Eric, rising to his feet.\n\u0026ldquo;Agba called,\u0026rdquo; Pat said tersely as all the rest of the mers launched themselves towards the water. \u0026ldquo;Hide in the jungle, don\u0026rsquo;t come out until you see us,\u0026rdquo; she ordered as she turned to the water.\nSally and Eric were rooted in place, watching the mers race to the water. Now that she knew why some of the mermaids seemed so graceless on the land, she marveled at how graceful they looked now, even the pregnant ones, when urgency motivated their movements. When the last of them disappeared into the water, they turned for the jungle, grabbing one of their small tents for shelter.\nThere were four of them, coming swiftly, using some sort of powered under water sled. Agba sent out the call, and then ordered the girls to hide among the rocks and reef. One of the four scuba divers on the sled raised his head, as though he had heard the high-pitched squeal that Agba emitted. The diver looked around, and saw a few dolphins in the dim sea beyond him. The sled slowed, and turned towards the opening in the reef that would allow them entry into the lagoon.\nTumibay signaled a halt, waiting for the sled to stop, trying to feel the presence of anyone in the water. He took a small periscope from the sled and floated towards the surface. He raised the scope to his eyes and extended the pole upwards into the air. He scanned the distant beach. He tried to steady the scope in the waves, zooming in on the apparently deserted sand. An old fishing boat that couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been Alberto\u0026rsquo;s was floating in the lagoon. That tracking device must be malfunctioning, he cursed silently.\nNo, the signal was strong, and that boat belonged to someone, but Alberto\u0026rsquo;s boat was nowhere to be seen, but it was here somewhere. Perhaps he had deliberately sunk the boat to avoid detection, Tumibay thought. That would explain the ancient fishing boat, which no drug lord would be caught dead sailing. Where was Alberto, he wondered? There were no sentries or lookouts, and all seemed quiet. Too quiet! He signaled everyone one to freeze. That instinct had saved his life many times in the past, and so he was content to float a few meters above his crew, alternating from the periscope to the water around him and back to the scope. Waiting.\nSuddenly, he saw a flash of silver and white, glowing in the dim water, just past the reef. It looked like a girl. Alberto\u0026rsquo;s sister, he thought to himself. What was she doing hiding underwater? He signaled to his crew to go around the other side of the reef while Tumibay slowly dropped towards the reef from above.\nAgba watched as the four strangers spotted Angara, and struggled over what to do. He could sense the approaching mers behind him, but they were still a minute or two away. The strangers would spot Angara before they arrived. As the sled neared Angara\u0026rsquo;s blind side, he sprang into action.\nHe sped towards the leader, still floating above, giving another shrill squeal that surprised the strangers. They all hesitated as they tried to assimilate the noise a dolphin might make with the vision of the young Filipino male rushing towards them, either being pushed by a very large fish, or being half fish himself. Tumibay dropped the scope and pulled his knife from its sheath, the long blade flashing in the dim sea. Agba veered away, trying to spear him with his barb, but he caught the air tank instead. The loud clank mirrored the sharp pain that ran up his tail as his barb bent against the metal tank.\nTumibay had turned his body, putting his tank between him and the strange creature as it sped by. He saw flashes of black and pink stir beyond the now visible white-tailed creature, but he dove down to what was clearly a mermaid, who was trying to hide among the coral. He grabbed the white hair and pulled the creature up to his chest, his knife resting on her throat. The young male fish/man turned and faced him, his young and handsome face twisted in horror. The other two creatures emerged from hiding as Tumibay\u0026rsquo;s own men struggled to overcome their awe.\nFor a long moment, Agba hung in the water, his beloved Angara frozen in the stranger\u0026rsquo;s grasp, her eyes full of fear. The tension was broken when a spear pierced his tail, a shot \u0026gt;from the men below. Despite his pain, and what seemed to be poison on the barb, Agba shot forward and pulled the stranger\u0026rsquo;s hand from Angara\u0026rsquo;s throat.\n\u0026ldquo;Flee,\u0026rdquo; he urged her, feeling his own strength begin to wan as the burning pain from the wound spread up from his tail.\nAngara twisted from the stranger\u0026rsquo;s grasp, and struck with her barb, catching him on the leg. Tumibay felt the barb enter his thigh, but he used the adrenaline that surged through him to yank his arm free from the merman\u0026rsquo;s grasp, and plunged his knife into the sea creature\u0026rsquo;s chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Nooooooo!\u0026rdquo; Angara screamed as she stabbed the stranger a second time, her barb sinking into Tumibay\u0026rsquo;s other leg. She saw blood starting to leak from Agba\u0026rsquo;s chest and swam towards him. \u0026ldquo;Ahhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; she screamed again, as another spear pierced her side, entering her chest between her ribs, just below her breast. She could feel the sharp pain of poison as it spread into her body.\nLiga and Alexis both launched themselves at the men in the sled, but even as they moved towards them, Gabriel, John, and MuSu swam past them at blinding speeds and each speared one of the men with their barbs.\nAngara pulled the knife from Agba\u0026rsquo;s chest, and tried to staunch the wound, but it was too great, and the poison was working on both of them.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, my love,\u0026rdquo; Agba struggled. \u0026ldquo;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t protect \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are poisoned,\u0026rdquo; Angara said softly, even as Liga and Alexis rose to their side, ignoring the paralyzed stranger floating next to them. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t touch,\u0026rdquo; she warned Alexis as her sister-wife reached for the end of the spear protruding from her ribs. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s poisoned, and you \u0026hellip;might \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get them back to the caves,\u0026rdquo; Liga urged.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Agba said sadly, reaching for his three pod-mates. \u0026ldquo;Encima \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; he whispered and then went limp in the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Mi amor,\u0026rdquo; Angara said softly, and she too stopped moving.\nThe rest of the mermaids arrived, too late to help.\n\u0026ldquo;NO!\u0026rdquo; Alexis argued. \u0026ldquo;It will not help anything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But they did it,\u0026rdquo; Liga argued, pointing at Petra, Gabriel, and Xing barely visible in the darkness. The sky had darkened as a storm approached. There was no longer any starlight or moonlight to illuminate the mers as they gathered on the beach with their dead and their prisoners in the middle of their circle. \u0026ldquo;They got to bury Michael and kill Alberto,\u0026rdquo; she cried.\n\u0026ldquo;Burying Michael did not help,\u0026rdquo; Petra said softly, cradling the fitful and squirming Michelle in her arms.\n\u0026ldquo;Killing Alberto helped,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said. \u0026ldquo;But giving Michael’s body to the sea now seems merely selfish.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then let me at least kill him,\u0026rdquo; Liga breathed, moving towards the now comatose Tumibay.\n\u0026ldquo;Liga, my flower of joy,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, her breath catching. \u0026ldquo;Don’t \u0026hellip; don’t kill \u0026hellip; I need you to be my flower.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Your flower that does nothing but smell pretty,\u0026rdquo; Liga fumed. \u0026ldquo;What good is that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Beauty and love need no justification,\u0026rdquo; Pat said firmly, quelling Liga’s growing anger. \u0026ldquo;Would you go back to being Lakan?\u0026rdquo;\nLiga blanched at Pat’s suggestion. \u0026ldquo;No, never \u0026hellip; please never go back to that,\u0026rdquo; she said, suddenly afraid.\n\u0026ldquo;We will create a just punishment for our intruders, but we need information from them,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued carefully. \u0026ldquo;Information that we cannot get if they are dead.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And we need information from our dear Agba and Angara,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, softly stroking Liga’s dark black hair. \u0026ldquo;Information we cannot get if they are drifting in the sea or buried beneath a pile of rocks 200 meters down.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I just \u0026hellip; just \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Liga broke down into heaving sobs, and buried her face in Alexis’ shoulder.\n\u0026ldquo;I know, my joyful flower,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said softly. \u0026ldquo;I know. I am pregnant too.\u0026rdquo;\nLiga pulled back, \u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You cannot see?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked.\n\u0026ldquo;When?\u0026rdquo; Liga asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You cannot tell?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked, stroking Liga’s cheeks in the moonlight.\n\u0026ldquo;Um \u0026hellip; none of us knew,\u0026rdquo; said Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Not until now,\u0026rdquo; Danni said.\n\u0026ldquo;Last night,\u0026rdquo; Alexis explained. \u0026ldquo;I had a sudden premonition, but I did not know why. Now, sadly, I know why.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh sister-wife,\u0026rdquo; Liga wailed anew. \u0026ldquo;Who will be the father to our children?\u0026rdquo;\nThere was a long silence as the two mermaids sobbed in each other\u0026rsquo;s arms.\n\u0026ldquo;I will,\u0026rdquo; Eric said. \u0026ldquo;If you’ll have me.\u0026rdquo;\nAll the mers turned to Sally and Eric where they sat on the beach. Sally took Eric’s hand in hers, and gave it a squeeze.\n\u0026ldquo;This is why I know that I love you,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;I won’t force myself on you,\u0026rdquo; Eric explained. \u0026ldquo;And I’m supposed to wait until after we get done with the gun.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; Petra exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;No \u0026hellip; they will need you sooner than that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In a few days, their need will be overpowering,\u0026rdquo; Xing continued. \u0026ldquo;Liga and Alexis must have a mate, and with both pregnant, neither can become the father without killing the fetus. They might go mad.\u0026rdquo;\nPat rubbed her own belly thoughtfully and looked across the sand at John. \u0026ldquo;I think Petra and Xing are right,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;I can feel my own needs changing with my pregnancy.\u0026rdquo; She turned to the two humans. \u0026ldquo;You did say that you would do what ever was best for everyone,\u0026rdquo; she reminded them. \u0026ldquo;Will you hold true?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You only ask because you do not know me,\u0026rdquo; Eric said evenly. \u0026ldquo;I will be true.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will,\u0026rdquo; Sally added.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you think Alexis, Liga?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\nLiga lifted her head from Alexis’ neck and looked at Eric, as though for the first time. Then she turned to Alexis and raised her eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;We do get some input, after all, on how he turns out,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said in a whisper only Liga could hear.\n\u0026ldquo;We would be honored to have Eric become our pod-mate,\u0026rdquo; Liga said softly between sobs.\n\u0026ldquo;And \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Alexis urged.\n\u0026ldquo;And Sally, too,\u0026rdquo; she said, sniffling.\n\u0026ldquo;And \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Alexis said gently.\n\u0026ldquo;And \u0026hellip; and \u0026hellip; we will allow Galina and Pat to perform an \u0026hellip; autopsy \u0026hellip; on Agba and \u0026hellip; and \u0026hellip; Angara,\u0026rdquo; Liga finished, sobbing again into Alexis’ shoulder.\n\u0026ldquo;And Angara’s child,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;That’s right,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;She was nine months pregnant.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She was nine months, nineteen days, and twelve hours pregnant,\u0026rdquo; said Liga, struggling to regain control. \u0026ldquo;Ten minutes more pregnant than me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The same as the others?\u0026rdquo; asked Sally.\n\u0026ldquo;No, it’s now the next day,\u0026rdquo; explained Xing. \u0026ldquo;Angara, Liga, and I were a day behind Pat, Phoebe, and Danni. They are now nine months, twenty days, and who cares how many hours pregnant.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fourteen,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;But who’s counting.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are,\u0026rdquo; Emma said lightly. \u0026ldquo;You nerd.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do we do?\u0026rdquo; asked Sally.\n\u0026ldquo;First, you will need to feed from Alexis and Liga, and that will get the process started,\u0026rdquo; Pat instructed. \u0026ldquo;The four of you can stay here with the other prisoners tomorrow when we take Tumibay back to the lab for some special treatments.\u0026rdquo;\nTumibay struggled to move. He had been dreaming, he was sure. As his eyes focused on the fire that danced before him, and in the fire\u0026rsquo;s light, he caught glimpses of the creatures of his nightmare. Half human, half fish, with terrible jewel-like eyes that seemed to bore through to his soul.\n\u0026ldquo;He is moving,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe announced.\nThe mers crowded around Tumibay, whose name they now knew thanks to the three men who accompanied him. The prisoners all had only one dose of mermaid venom, and proved all too eager to talk to these creatures of mythology, especially when two of them seemed to speak perfect Filipino. Tumibay, thanks to his double dose, had come back to consciousness hours after his crew.\n\u0026ldquo;Hello, Tumibay,\u0026rdquo; Pat said in Filipino. \u0026ldquo;I’m Pat, and I’m a mermaid.\u0026rdquo; She continued as she watched the poor man struggle to both regain control of his body and assimilate the news she was telling him. \u0026ldquo;We know lots about you, and your boat is now at the bottom of the sea.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What happened to my boat?\u0026rdquo; Tumibay said, without meaning to say anything.\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued evenly. \u0026ldquo;You speak and understand English. That will make things so much easier.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck you,\u0026rdquo; Tumibay spat.\n\u0026ldquo;Not likely,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Though I’m sure you’d like to,\u0026rdquo; she said as she pushed her impressive breasts into his face. \u0026ldquo;You see, the problem is that I’m pregnant, and I can’t really fuck you the way that you deserve.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That would be my job,\u0026rdquo; John said with a menace that no one could mistake. \u0026ldquo;But I’m pretty sure that you don’t want me to fuck you, right?\u0026rdquo;\nTumibay turned his attention to the merman who spoke and calculated the damage the tall, long, and broad shouldered mer could do to him.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Good to hear,\u0026rdquo; John said with a smile that wasn’t friendly. \u0026ldquo;Because I’m not very good at being nice to strangers that I’m fucking.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, we have a few questions,\u0026rdquo; Pat said lightly. \u0026ldquo;Care to answer some of them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What questions?\u0026rdquo; Tumibay asked, seeing for the first time his men trussed up along the beach, each squirming in the dim light of the fire.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, don’t worry about them,\u0026rdquo; Pat reassured him. \u0026ldquo;They are all still alive and healthy, but they couldn\u0026rsquo;t answer all our questions.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What questions?\u0026rdquo; Tumibay asked again, trying to regain some ground.\n\u0026ldquo;Who do you work for? Why are you here? What do you want?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\nTumibay looked at Pat, trying to gage her resolve. He looked again at his men.\n\u0026ldquo;What happened to my boat?\u0026rdquo; he repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Your men were kind enough to let us know where it was,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;And when we tried to contact them, they fired guns at us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Silly men,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe added. \u0026ldquo;Bullets don’t penetrate water.\u0026rdquo;\nTumibay turned to look at the pretty, blue-tailed mermaid. \u0026ldquo;But mermaid nails can rip through some surprisingly dense materials,\u0026rdquo; she said brandishing her beautiful but sharp nails.\n\u0026ldquo;A fiberglass hull?\u0026rdquo; Tumibay said, betraying his disbelief.\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing to it,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, licking her fingers.\n\u0026ldquo;Long story short,\u0026rdquo; Pat interrupted, holding up a small electronic device. \u0026ldquo;You’re stuck, no tracking devices left (your men told us about those), and you have two choices; talk or die.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I will die,\u0026rdquo; Tumibay said without emotion.\n\u0026ldquo;That’s fine,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;It may take a few days. I hope you’re not in any hurry to die.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; he asked with the slightest tension in his voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi,\u0026rdquo; Galina said as she leaned over him from above his head. \u0026ldquo;I don’t think we’ve been introduced. I’m Galina, a former Russian scientist with experience in bio-psychological response systems.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Huh?\u0026rdquo; Tumibay said growing more worried.\n\u0026ldquo;Torture,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, laying on a thick Russian accent she no longer actually had. \u0026ldquo;You do know what I mean?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck you,\u0026rdquo; Tumibay repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Have it your way,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with a smile.\nEric was nervous at first, approaching Alexis who was clearly a beautiful woman, with her blond hair, blue eyes, bright smile, and inviting breasts. He kept glancing over to Sally, hoping for some signal that everything would be alright. He was moving swiftly from being just Sally\u0026rsquo;s mate to becoming a pod-mate to three mermaids. The shift in his head was tectonic, and he was struggling with his emotions.\nSally, on the other hand, eagerly shed her clothes and curled herself up into Liga\u0026rsquo;s petite lap, gazing up into her rich dark eyes, slightly Asian, and her thick but straight black hair. She happily began drinking from her breast, noting that it looked much larger that it actually was as she wrapped her hand around the round, full breast. It must be Liga\u0026rsquo;s petite frame, she thought as she pulled on the stiff nipple, feeling the sweet warmth of mermaid milk slide down her throat. She herself was only a little taller than the small Filipino mermaid must have been when she was a woman, er, man. Sally hoped that she looked as spectacular when she became a mermaid. Maybe her breasts would grow so that they looked similarly large on her own slightly larger, though still petite frame.\n\u0026ldquo;Eric?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked.\nEric shifted his gaze from Alexis who held her arms out to him back to Sally, who was eagerly drinking from Liga\u0026rsquo;s breast. He blushed.\n\u0026ldquo;Eric,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s alright. You\u0026rsquo;ll see. Sally, will you tell him it\u0026rsquo;s alright?\u0026rdquo;\nSally lifted her head from Liga\u0026rsquo;s breast so she could talk, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t turn her lips away. \u0026ldquo;Seaman First Class Edwards, I order you to suck on Alexis' breasts. In fact, I order you to enjoy doing so.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;See,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said gently, with a touch of sadness. \u0026ldquo;It will all be alright. She will be in charge!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Men are never in charge,\u0026rdquo; Liga said thoughtfully as she stroked Sally\u0026rsquo;s hair, enjoying her first time as a feeder, feeling the amazing sensations of love and sensuality sweep through her body. \u0026ldquo;I think Sally will make an excellent pod-mate, but I will miss Angara.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We both will,\u0026rdquo; Alexis agreed. \u0026ldquo;But we can make a new family with Eric, if he will let us be in charge.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Edwards!\u0026rdquo; Sally ordered, dropping her mouth immediately back onto Liga\u0026rsquo;s nipple.\n\u0026ldquo;I give up,\u0026rdquo; Eric said, dropping his own pants and sinking onto the sand next to the beautiful blond mermaid.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s usually best if that happens early in the relationship,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;It saves a lot of trouble later. Now drink like a good boy, and if you\u0026rsquo;re really good, you\u0026rsquo;ll get an extra special reward later.\u0026rdquo;\nTumibay blinked in the harsh light of the LED’s the burned into his eyes from above. He didn’t know where he was, but he knew he was in a cave. He had vague recollections of being stung by the mermaids again, and then dragged through the water, and finally arriving in this harshly lit cave.\n\u0026ldquo;Our patient is awake,\u0026rdquo; Galina said.\n\u0026ldquo;Good morning,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;How are you feeling?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck you,\u0026rdquo; Tumibay said again.\n\u0026ldquo;My, my, such a large vocabulary,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Let’s try again, shall we? Who do you work for? Why are you here? What do you want?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck you,\u0026rdquo; he repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Galina, he’s all yours,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with resignation.\n\u0026ldquo;My pleasure,\u0026rdquo; she said as she salamandered over to the gurney on which he was bound. He noticed for the first time that Plexiglas walls surrounded him as he lay on the gurney. \u0026ldquo;Let’s see if we have this particular formula right,\u0026rdquo; she said as she injected him with a clear fluid. \u0026ldquo;It should only take a few minutes.\u0026rdquo;\nThe mers stood over Tumibay, watching him with interest. Nothing seemed to be happening.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps we didn\u0026rsquo;t include enough of the change agent in the new formula,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe mused as she looked up from her computer screen, where data from numerous electrodes ran back from Tumibay\u0026rsquo;s body.\n\u0026ldquo;It needs some time to build up to reactive power, and we\u0026rsquo;re not sending any electrical signals to him,\u0026rdquo; Galina observed. \u0026ldquo;Our tests showed that our influence on the change is only present in water, when there is conductive material between us and the transformee. This change will be entirely on his own.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And this formula is actually more viral than our own milk,\u0026rdquo; Pat reminded Phoebe. \u0026ldquo;In fact, it might be too viral.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Once a critical mass is reached,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, \u0026ldquo;the change could happen in minutes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I hope it doesn\u0026rsquo;t kill him,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\nTumibay turned his head sharply at that comment. He wondered what they were talking about, but he could feel a tingling sensation crawl up his arm from where the mermaid had injected him with the drug. As the minutes passed, the tingling spread and became a burning sensation. Pain was nothing new, nothing he couldn’t deal with. The tingling changed, however, and became a burning sensation that wasn’t pain so much as it was a feeling of shifting cells, of skin melting, of bones liquefying.\n\u0026ldquo;What \u0026hellip; are \u0026hellip; you \u0026hellip; doing \u0026hellip; to \u0026hellip; me?\u0026rdquo; he asked through gritted teeth.\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing,\u0026rdquo; Galina said. \u0026ldquo;What happens next is up to you. Your own brain will shape your body into the form that exists in your imagination. If you answer our questions, I might stop the process. If you don’t, the change will be up to your own imagination.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Try not to think of anything strange,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Like us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or of other mythic creatures,\u0026rdquo; Galina continued, glancing over at Phoebe as she manned the instruments that were monitoring their prisoner. \u0026ldquo;It would probably be a good idea not to think of anything.\u0026rdquo;\nTumibay groaned. His mind was swirling with horrific images from his childhood and imagination. Vampires, sea monsters, beasts of mixed origination, all jumped and swirled in his mind.\n\u0026ldquo;Stop \u0026hellip; make it stop,\u0026rdquo; he pleaded.\n\u0026ldquo;Who do you work for? Why are you here? What do you want?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Malaki,\u0026rdquo; he said, his chest heaving as the visions multiplied in his head.\n\u0026ldquo;Who is Malaki?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Business man, Alberto\u0026rsquo;s boss,\u0026rdquo; Tumibay answered, feeling his body begin to constrict.\n\u0026ldquo;Your boss too?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; he answered, breathing quickly. \u0026ldquo;Make it stop!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not done answering questions,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued brightly. \u0026ldquo;Why are you here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Kill Alberto, get Malaki\u0026rsquo;s money,\u0026rdquo; Tumibay said as he felt his body begin to twitch and shift.\n\u0026ldquo;The five million dollars?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;How do you—?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I ask the questions,\u0026rdquo; Pat reminded him.\n\u0026ldquo;What questions?\u0026rdquo; Tumibay asked, his body beginning to slough off skin and fat and water.\n\u0026ldquo;This is a very important question,\u0026rdquo; Pat warned him. \u0026ldquo;Are you listening?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeeeeesch, daaaaamnit,\u0026rdquo; he hissed, losing control of his body.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you want?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked. \u0026ldquo;What does your heart want?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Blooooooooooood,\u0026rdquo; Tumibay said, his body beginning to visibly shrink and shift.\nThe mermaids watched with detached interest as Tumibay’s body continued to shrink over the next several minutes, bio-mass falling away from his quickly morphing body. Within minutes he was no longer recognizable as a human, and only a few minutes after that, there was a large lamprey thrashing around in the gurney.\n\u0026ldquo;That new serum is powerful,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said with awe.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe too powerful,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;That only took a few minutes, and look how much bio-mass he left all over the gurney.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;At least he\u0026rsquo;s not dead,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Not yet,\u0026rdquo; Pat observed.\n\u0026ldquo;What were the bio-metric readings?\u0026rdquo; asked Galina, looking at Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Zero bio-electrical input from us,\u0026rdquo; she said, reading a computer screen. \u0026ldquo;100% from his own brain.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Justice,\u0026rdquo; Pat concluded. \u0026ldquo;Are there any special properties to the eel on the table?\u0026rdquo; she asked, indicating the former man now thrashing on the gurney, his bloodsucking mouth gaping in the air.\n\u0026ldquo;It’s a normal lamprey, as far as I can tell,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, looking at two other computer screens.\n\u0026ldquo;Then, let’s not kill it,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Is the tunnel clear?\u0026rdquo;\nGalina sent out a high-pitched squeal, and a few seconds later, Emma popped up from the pool at the edge of their lab.\n\u0026ldquo;What did he turn into?\u0026rdquo; she asked with eagerness.\n\u0026ldquo;A lamprey,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Cool,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;Anything special?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t think so,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;But let\u0026rsquo;s not take any chances. Clear the tunnel and close off the alternate passages. We\u0026rsquo;re gonna release him, er, it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Really,\u0026rdquo; Galina said as she clipped a radio tag to the lamprey\u0026rsquo;s dorsal fin. \u0026ldquo;Signal when you\u0026rsquo;re ready.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can we follow it?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Only if MuSu is in charge,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;I promise,\u0026rdquo; Emma said earnestly, while Galina, Phoebe, and Pat all shared a glance.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then, get to it,\u0026rdquo; Pat urged.\nEmma dipped back under the surface, and a few minutes later, they heard the signal from MuSu. Emma was smart; she knew that only MuSu\u0026rsquo;s agreement would trigger the release.\nPat and Galina tipped the table towards the water, and the eel and several kilos of bio-mass fell into the water. After a moment of shock, the lamprey oriented itself and headed towards the sea.\n\u0026ldquo;Do lamprey’s actually serve some purpose in the ocean\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem, or are they more like mosquitoes?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked.\n\u0026ldquo;They are mostly freshwater animals,\u0026rdquo; Pat observed. \u0026ldquo;And, yes, they are true parasites—like mosquitoes. But, I don’t think Tumibay will last long in the ocean. He looks like a shark meal to me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Justice,\u0026rdquo; Galina concluded.\nAn hour later, MuSu and the girls returned to the lab and reported that justice was indeed served thanks to a hammerhead shark.\nAlexis and Liga stared resolutely into Pat’s unwavering gaze as the later afternoon sun glinted off the water.\n\u0026ldquo;We are not sorry,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said carefully.\n\u0026ldquo;You don’t understand,\u0026rdquo; Liga explained.\n\u0026ldquo;They couldn’t help it,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said. \u0026ldquo;I couldn’t have stopped myself. Maybe it’s part of the bonding process.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They shouldn’t have killed those prisoners,\u0026rdquo; Pat exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;Those men didn’t deserve to die.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hired guns, paid assassins?\u0026rdquo; exclaimed Galina. \u0026ldquo;They had been hired by Tumibay to be his army. They would have killed you before you had a chance to say hello.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about Liga?\u0026rdquo; Pat said pointedly. \u0026ldquo;She was once one of those men.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Once,\u0026rdquo; Liga said slowly. \u0026ldquo;But I could not have become me without you. Those men were not yet me. They killed my pod-mates.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We could have saved them,\u0026rdquo; Pat argued.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we could have,\u0026rdquo; John said as he hugged his pod-mate to his side. \u0026ldquo;But we didn’t. We can’t save everyone. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t save Agba and Angara.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We do not blame you,\u0026rdquo; Liga said quickly. \u0026ldquo;We only fulfilled our duty to our pod-mate.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nevertheless,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;We still \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;You did not kill them. You did not let them be killed. Those men killed our mates. We killed them. It is enough.\u0026rdquo;\nThere was a tension on the beach as everyone processed the moment. The three prisoners had been torn limb from limb, their bodies scattered along the beach. Earlier that morning, after the mers had taken Tumibay and Agba and Angara\u0026rsquo;s bodies back to the caves, Eric and Sally were grateful that the two mermaids offered to take over guard duties after their morning feeding so that they could go up to the hot tub before their transition. Eric had wanted to spend some more time alone with Sally before he became responsible for two more mermaids, both of whom were pregnant with another merman\u0026rsquo;s child. When they had returned to the beach several hours later, there was blood everywhere.\n\u0026ldquo;MuSu?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked. \u0026ldquo;Can you and the girls take care of the bodies? I hate to make you do all this work, but beach time is becoming more and more difficult for most of us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No problem,\u0026rdquo; he answered, as he and his girls turned towards the carnage the two widows had created.\n\u0026ldquo;No, wait,\u0026rdquo; Petra urged. \u0026ldquo;Look,\u0026rdquo; she said as she pointed at Alexis and Liga, who were huddled together, shaking and moaning with pain.\n\u0026ldquo;Eric and Sally?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked. \u0026ldquo;Are you ready? They need you now,\u0026rdquo; she finished, nodding towards the two mermaids who were now twitching uncontrollably with need, holding each other in a death-like-embrace.\n\u0026ldquo;The time for death is past,\u0026rdquo; Eric said, rising, taking Sally\u0026rsquo;s hand in his. He and Sally walked over to the two shaking mermaids, and helped them to the water. \u0026ldquo;It is time for new life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We can clean up later,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said.\n\u0026ldquo;Or the birds might do our work for us,\u0026rdquo; Emma noted, watching the gathering of sea birds over the western arm of the lagoon.\n\u0026ldquo;Neon blue damsel,\u0026rdquo; Sally explained. \u0026ldquo;Royal blue with silver and light blue highlights.\u0026rdquo;\nThe mers all bobbed in the Moon Pool, while Sally explained what they both hoped for. \u0026ldquo;My first salt water fish as a child was a Neon Damsel.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know the species,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, concentrating on sharing that vision with her pod-mates and fellow mers. \u0026ldquo;Turn around, I want to see if your gills are coming in. Eric, you too.\u0026rdquo;\nSally turned and lifted her tee shirt over her head. \u0026ldquo;We won’t be needing clothes much longer anyway,\u0026rdquo; she said to Eric as she threw the garment onto the floor of the cave. He took off his tee shirt as well.\n\u0026ldquo;Your first feedings have worked,\u0026rdquo; Pat observed. \u0026ldquo;Your gills have developed from this morning. Sally, you’re first, so that you can be Eric\u0026rsquo;s last.\u0026rdquo;\nSally gave Eric a quick kiss. \u0026ldquo;See you in a few minutes,\u0026rdquo; she said lightly, hiding her own anxiety with bravado. She dove into the pool.\nShe found herself surrounded by mers in the middle of the pool, the fading evening light cascading down from the chimney high above. Sally swam towards Liga.\n\u0026ldquo;Will you be my sister wife and give me my tail?\u0026rdquo; she said with some difficulty, trying to remember the ritual Pat had explained to her. \u0026ldquo;Give me my tail,\u0026rdquo; she whispered as she reached for Liga’s breast and sucked.\nLiga felt the now familiar stirrings of warmth, and fullness spread to her breasts. Sally was forcefully pulling milk from her breast, but she had never felt this level of emotion or sensation, even when making love to her pod-mates. This feeding was more intense than the first feedings on the beach. Liga felt her powerful milk pour from her chest into Sally\u0026rsquo;s eager mouth. After a few minutes, Sally no longer felt the burning need for air in her lungs, and she switched to Liga’s other breast. When that one was empty, she moved to Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;You are the mother to us all,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Will you give me my tail?\u0026rdquo;\nPat smiled and collected the soon-to-be-mer into her arms. After Sally had finished with her, she moved onto Danni, and then Phoebe. Sally could feel the power of the mermaid milk building in her body, and she focused on the mermaid she had wished to become for so long. When she took John’s incredible cock into her mouth, she felt yet another leap in power, as forces throbbed through her body, roiling up and down through her legs and torso. Her brain became a whirlpool of emotions and images, and she struggled to maintain her focus.\n\u0026ldquo;Sally,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, lifting her breasts in the water. \u0026ldquo;You can do this, focus.\u0026rdquo;\nSally smiled and felt suddenly buoyed by Petra’s presence. \u0026ldquo;First Mother Mermaid, give me my tail,\u0026rdquo; she said as she fell onto one of Petra\u0026rsquo;s enormous breasts. Petra drew a sharp breath, savoring again the special feelings generated by feeding, thrilling to the power of pumping her milk into Sally that would transform the young woman forever.\nLiga and Pat shared a quick look and floated down below the circle, under Sally’s thin, graceful legs, and began rubbing them lengthwise. Sally moaned into Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts as the other girls stimulated her skin, helping her focus her building energies onto her lower body. She fixed in her mind, the beautiful and strong mermaid, stronger than any Navy Seal, able to withstand deep ocean pressures and cold temperatures, and who had a dangerous barb in her tail. As she finished with Petra, Sally could feel other changes that were happening to her body. Her own breasts were beginning to tighten, and her already small waist seemed to draw into self a bit more. Her hair was flowing down her back, and the power of the mermaid milk built within her body.\nSally continued onto Galina, Xing, and then Gabriel, each time the power building within her, and each time she would struggle to regain focus, to control the powerful forces that seemed to sweep and surge through her body. She could also feel the combined mental focus of the mers as they surrounded her, supporting her, urging her to transform. She welcomed that transformation, giving her body over to the pressures and powers that both swirled within and around her body. She could feel her legs beginning to stiffen, pressing together as the power of the mer fluids built in her body. The mers had begun to hum, and the sound filled her with passion and power.\nSally moved on to MuSu’s pod, taking milk and sperm from them, feeling her entire body quivering with passion and the effort to control the powerful forces that now surged within her. Her legs were now stiff, her toes fused together, pointing to the bottom of the pool. She could feel Pat and Liga rubbing them lightly, up and down, up and down. She turned to Alexis, her last. \u0026ldquo;Come my sister-wife, be my last and give me my tail,\u0026rdquo; she gasped.\nAlexis floated towards her new sister-wife slowly, feeling the entire pool filled with energy and vibrations. When Sally attached herself to her breast, Alexis quivered in a sudden orgasm, her breasts and vagina swelled and pulsed milk and cum into the water. After many long moments, Alexis stopped shaking, and Sally pulled back, her own moaning merging with the humming of the other mers. Her arms pulled out horizontally while her now merged feet were stiffly pointed towards the bottom, suspended in the middle of the circle. Pat and Liga swam back up to their places in the circle and waited.\nSally was slowly turning in the water, and her skin was rippling with the power of the mer-fluids she had consumed. Under the surface of her skin, she could feel great tremors of movement and muscles, energy and electricity running throughout her body. She suddenly felt a great urge to push, and she stopped humming as she bore down with her stomach muscles. Sally felt her womb spasm as her legs knit themselves together and lengthened towards the bottom of the pool. She could feel her nerves, blood vessels, bones, and muscles pulling apart and pushing together, as waves and waves of energy pulsed through her legs and lower torso. She could feel the power of the mers pressing against her, her skin tingling as their electrical signals guided her changes. She could feel her womb lengthening and sinking as other internal parts also moved forward and down. She could feel her gills tingling, her breasts were growing, swelling into the water, and her hair brushing the top of her ass. But it was not an ass for much longer.\nIn minutes her tail formed, bones, muscles, and nerves pushing themselves into new arrangements, flukes, fins, and dorsal ridges thrusting out from her new appendage, new energies radiating throughout her quickly changing body. Her face, her hair, and her skin were all changing, transforming—becoming a mermaid. A final pulse raced through her body, and Sally shook in a great release of ecstasy, her newly formed tail arching above her head. The beautiful blue and silver tail shimmered in the fading sunlight that dappled the Moon Pool. Suddenly, she relaxed in the water. It had taken less than an hour. She was finished, complete; she was a mermaid.\nIt was better than any orgasm she had ever had.\nEric looked at Sally yet again, not quite believing that it was real. His own, newly formed tail fluttered back and forth below him, and his new, long, thick and powerful cock was twitching deep within his tail.\n\u0026ldquo;You’re more beautiful than I thought possible,\u0026rdquo; Sally said as she swam towards her new mate. \u0026ldquo;What do you think?\u0026rdquo; she asked Alexis and Liga.\nThe three mermaids drank in the sight of their new pod-mate. Eric’s body had lengthened as he transformed, and his hair had darkened from his original dark brown to a rich black. His eyes had also darkened. His royal blue tail was fringed with silver, and silver and blue highlights sparkled throughout his tail, fins, and flukes. He was now nearly three meters long, his shoulders were broad and strong, and a dorsal fin rose from his back.\nEric remembered John’s warning as his three mermaid-wives closed in on him, and pulled his new vent muscle to allow his now much larger cock the freedom it needed. Twelve inches pushed out into the water, and he could feel the stiffness throbbing halfway down his new tail.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; Sally breathed. \u0026ldquo;That’s amazing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It gets better,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, pushing her new sister wife towards their pod-mate. \u0026ldquo;We have the flanks; you have the front.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Sally protested weakly, her own passion rising within her transformed body with unexpected force. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve made love to him many times, and you are \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pregnant,\u0026rdquo; Liga said. \u0026ldquo;Besides, he will last many times tonight. We will all get our turn.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Many times?\u0026rdquo; Sally said, her chest rising and falling with passion, her newly enlarged breasts swaying in the water as she was pushed towards Eric\u0026rsquo;s long, stiff cock.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;Trust me, you\u0026rsquo;ll need it many times. Just remember, do not imagine the color of your child\u0026rsquo;s eyes if you do not yet want to join us in motherhood.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Eric urged. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to deal with your father to have him discover that you\u0026rsquo;re no longer human and you\u0026rsquo;re pregnant.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not in charge, remember?\u0026rdquo; teased Alexis. \u0026ldquo;Sally?\u0026rdquo; she urged as she stroked Sally\u0026rsquo;s dorsal ridge, pushing her towards Eric. \u0026ldquo;The sooner you go first, the sooner we get our turn.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Sally said as she reached down to guide Eric\u0026rsquo;s throbbing cock towards her own pulsing vagina. She tried pushing his cock into her newly formed mermaid vagina, but it was too big, and his head stretched her lips to their maximum.\n\u0026ldquo;Wrap your tail around his,\u0026rdquo; Alexis advised. \u0026ldquo;You get better leverage.\u0026rdquo;\nSally quickly twirled her tail around his, feeling his strong muscles quiver beneath her flukes, marveling at how they felt like her toes, each bony ridge a toe that could be wiggled in coordination with the others, or alone. She brought her now free hand up to Eric\u0026rsquo;s neck, and pulled herself onto Eric\u0026rsquo;s cock. The thick head pushed past her outer lips and slipped quickly in, up to the first six inches. She could feel a ridge of tissue and the tightness of her own vagina obstructing further entry.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not a virgin again?\u0026rdquo; she gasped, as her passion and her frustration warred with one another.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Liga advised. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t get that back. It\u0026rsquo;s the way mermaids are. Those are some new muscles that you\u0026rsquo;ll use if you decide to become pregnant.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s also your newly enlarged G-spot,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, her own eyes lidded with passion as she pressed herself into Eric\u0026rsquo;s quivering pelvic fin. \u0026ldquo;Push \u0026hellip; it will be fine.\u0026rdquo;\nSally looked up into Eric\u0026rsquo;s eyes, and noticed how filled with love and warmth they were. Other than the darker color, those same easygoing eyes had shyly smiled back at her over coffee at the PX so many months ago. Now, they were the eyes of her mate, her pod-mate, her own merman. She pushed herself onto him and slowly sank herself all the way onto Eric\u0026rsquo;s cock. She felt so full, so wonderful, so complete.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; oh \u0026hellip; oh,\u0026rdquo; moaned Liga as she squirmed on Eric\u0026rsquo;s other pelvic fin, her slightly swollen belly obscuring their view of her vagina.\n\u0026ldquo;Oooooommmmmmm,\u0026rdquo; Eric breathed, feeling Sally squeeze the length of his long cock with her new muscles, his tail quivering with passion. He could feel Alexis' and Liga\u0026rsquo;s hot vents pressed into the ends of his pleasantly stiff pelvic fins, each sensation added to the sensuousness of Sally\u0026rsquo;s long strokes as she began to pump herself along the length of his shaft. The soft caresses of each of their tails as they entwined themselves around his stiff, strong, tail sent shivers running up and down his back.\n\u0026ldquo;This is much better than that time on the boat,\u0026rdquo; he whispered to his new mermaid-mate. \u0026ldquo;I don’t have to pretend to have a tail anymore.\u0026rdquo;\nAlexis suddenly stiffened and clutched at Eric, pressing her entire body along his arms, hips, and tail. Her breasts began spurting milk into the water as her face twisted into a mask of pleasure. Liga joined her, while Sally and Eric were now slamming their pelvic bones into one another\u0026rsquo;s, their bodies shaking, Sally making mewling noises that she couldn\u0026rsquo;t control. As Alexis and Liga recovered from their orgasms, they winked at one another, and each ran their hands up along their new pod-mate\u0026rsquo;s gills.\nBright, blazing colors burned behind both of their closed eyes, their backs arched away from one another as their tails were pressed together, each vibrating and shaking as Sally\u0026rsquo;s newly enlarged breasts began to spurt milk into the water, matching Eric\u0026rsquo;s own pulses that she felt surging deep within her body. The orgasms that ran through both their bodies would be one that each would remember for a long time. Nothing had ever felt like that before, and as Sally slowly opened her eyes and took in the beautiful sight of three mers all entwined together, a white mist surrounding them in the water, she felt true happiness for the first time in her life. She barely noticed the three other clouds of white that marked the other pods in the far corners of the Moon Pool.\nAfter several minutes of kissing and stroking, talking and sharing, Sally told Alexis that it was her turn. Four hours later, Eric finally fell a sleep, three beautiful mermaids draped on his strong frame.\nTo be continued?\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/changes-in-paradise08/","tags":["mermaids","transgender","transformation"],"title":"Changes in Paradise: Part 08 - Perils, Proposals, and Progeny"},{"categories":["Mermaids"],"contents":"New mers bond with their new pod-mates, the Connors finally make landfall and discover the changes and more, but they cannot stay, at least not all of them. The story continues.\nAlexis sat on a low rock near Rocky Cove, her tail mostly in the water as she raised her breasts toward the morning sun, enjoying the warmth on her face and upper torso. Liga floated in the water next to her, her head resting on Alexis' lap, keeping her growing belly in the water where it was more comfortable.\n\u0026ldquo;Look,\u0026rdquo; Liga exclaimed, pointing out to sea. \u0026ldquo;Watch how high they can go!\u0026rdquo;\nAlexis turned her face away from the sun and focused on the water closer to the rocks on which she sat. She saw two royal blue mertails slice into the water from what must have been a vertical re-entry, barely a splash raised by their broad and strong flukes. A few seconds later, both Eric and Sally erupted from the water a few meters further out, arching high into the air, topping out at nearly four meters above the surface of the water.\nTheir tails were gleaming in the morning sun, the water cascading off of their strong and sinewy bodies, and their torsos facing towards the sky. They twisted in unison, turning over onto their backs as they pointed their hands back towards the water. Their bodies followed the perfect line of their hands, straightening back out as they passed through the top of the arc, their pelvic and mid-tail fins at perfect forty-five degree angles out from their tails, and their flukes were parallel to their shoulders. They both sliced back into the waves, arrow straight, with no splash.\n\u0026ldquo;Our new mates are strong,\u0026rdquo; Alexis observed, stroking Liga\u0026rsquo;s hair.\n\u0026ldquo;And beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Liga said wistfully.\n\u0026ldquo;And much bigger than Ag—\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, remembering the previous evening with a lusty smile.\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; Liga interrupted. \u0026ldquo;No talk of Agba and Angara. It\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, caressing the petite mermaid\u0026rsquo;s cheek. \u0026ldquo;I am sorry. We should not compare.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Liga said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s because we are \u0026hellip; they are \u0026hellip; we haven\u0026rsquo;t \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, putting her hand on Liga\u0026rsquo;s forehead. \u0026ldquo;It has to be done, and we must bear it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t have to like it,\u0026rdquo; Liga sighed.\nTogether, they watched their new pod-mates play and tried not to think about why Eric and Sally had suggested that the pod go to the eastern caves this morning. Their former pod mates were undergoing an autopsy.\nMalaki straightened up from the table, set down the magnifying glass he had been using, and rubbed his temples. The last radio report from Tumibay indicated that he had come within a few kilometers of the signal \u0026gt;from Alberto\u0026rsquo;s boat, and he would be going after them that night. That message was four days ago. Three days ago, a second message was sent, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t Tumibay, and whoever was talking wasn\u0026rsquo;t making much sense, raving about sea monsters that were destroying the boat, ripping it apart. The signal had been lost, but Malaki\u0026rsquo;s operator, who had spoken to the raving man, thought Tumibay\u0026rsquo;s crew had been drinking.\nSea monsters? Impossible! Ripping apart a boat? Tumibay\u0026rsquo;s boat was one of Malaki\u0026rsquo;s finest yachts. Alberto must have cooked up something unexpected. Malaki sighed as he picked the magnifying glass again. There were several small islands and atolls within 20 kilometers of Tumibay\u0026rsquo;s last reported position. Some were barely a sand bar in the ocean, while others were more substantial, their volcano cores still smoldering. He identified ten islands that could hide Alberto and his men, but he could find no sign of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s boats. He needed more information before he sent another team out in search of his problematic minion.\n\u0026ldquo;Miss Chin,\u0026rdquo; he barked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir?\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Come in here,\u0026rdquo; he ordered.\nThe pretty, Chinese secretary walked carefully into his large office. She was rarely called into his office, and when she was, she knew that her next task would involve something illegal. Shen Chin had always been a bright child, the best in her small, rural school outside of Guangzhou, and had won a scholarship, through relatives in Hong Kong, to go to college at Oxford. She had brought great honor to her family, and when she graduated, she hoped to work for a multi-national company. Dimaunahan Industries had seemed, at first, a great start. Two years ago, when she was first hired, she tried to know as much as possible about Malaki\u0026rsquo;s business, but he kept nearly everything hidden.\nOnce her sister was kidnapped, that all changed. Malaki did his homework; Shen loved her family and her older sister. Once he kidnapped Lin, he forced Shen \u0026ldquo;into the fold\u0026rdquo; as his trustworthy executive assistant by threatening both Lin\u0026rsquo;s life and the honor of her family. Now, she tried to know as little as possible and only came into his office when ordered. Only the knowledge that her good behavior here kept Lin alive allowed Shen to do the things Malaki ordered her to do.\nMalaki found that such \u0026ldquo;recruitment\u0026rdquo; techniques worked very well for a few years before a new secretary was necessary. Men or women, it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter. After two or three years, they were killed or sent to the brothels. Malaki liked the system because the one person who knew the most about his empire was also the most temporary. It made secrets easier to keep.\n\u0026ldquo;Tell Manalo to get me all the information on our current business arrangements with Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, and any other governments in this area,\u0026rdquo; he ordered. \u0026ldquo;I want to know every detail of every transaction that we might have had for the last year in these locations,\u0026rdquo; he pointed at the map, indicating that she should take notes.\n\u0026ldquo;You get me a list of all the government officials we have under our influence or who owe me a favor in the surrounding areas,\u0026rdquo; he said as he strolled back to his large window overlooking the city. \u0026ldquo;I want both reports back to me by the end of the day.\u0026rdquo;\nHis oldest son, Manalo, had been clamoring for more responsibilities in his business for some time. Well, it was time to see what kind of backbone the boy had.\nThe lab cave was one of the largest caves that the mers inhabited. The expansive floor of the brightly lit cave was littered with equipment, wires, and storage racks. Most of the larger equipment had been moved to the edges of the cave, and two long steel tables were in the center of the room. The tables, which were some of the largest pieces of equipment in the room, were three meters long and one meter wide, and were perched on gurneys that the mers had cut down to 30 cm (one foot) high. Equipment much longer or thicker than these examination tables could not be brought to the cave, because there was a bend in the tunnel that prevented anything longer from making that turn.\nA sweet and sour smell filled the room. A stranger might have remarked that the smell seemed like an odd combination of a \u0026ldquo;Saturday morning fish market\u0026rdquo; and a \u0026ldquo;high school locker room:\u0026rdquo; fish, smelly socks, and Lysol. The four mermaids in the room, however, had long since grown used to the smell, though an occasional wave of nausea swept through Phoebe and Emma. All four of them were hunched over one table, turning a small, lifeless mermaid over onto her stomach.\nOn the other table, a long merman\u0026rsquo;s body stretched a few centimeters over the end of the table, the ends of his wide flukes drooping lifelessly towards the floor of the cave. A large plastic bag with Russian lettering held the majority of his internal organs, and his entire body cavity, from his face to the base of his tail, was exposed to view. On a small metal tray nearby, two thin metal spears gleamed in the blue-white light of the LED\u0026rsquo;s, each one topped by small, pointed barb. Each tip was hollow, and the small cavities were still stained with the bluish residue of the organophosphate poison that killed Agba and Angara.\nAfter they succeeded in turning Angara\u0026rsquo;s smaller body onto her stomach, they all stretched. Agba\u0026rsquo;s autopsy had taken most of the morning, but the mermaids had learned a great deal. After their stretch, Pat and Galina began making incisions along the sides of her dorsal ridge. Emma and Phoebe, both trying to maintain their composure and their lunch, settled in front of nearby computers, typing furiously as Pat and Galina dictated their findings to them. Several electrodes ran from Angara\u0026rsquo;s body to Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s computer, and data scrolled across her screen.\nPat stopped talking and arched her back, trying to get more comfortable, but her growing belly made the long hours at the operating table difficult. Phoebe was struggling as well, but neither wanted to stop because of the joy of pure scientific discovery. With nearly each pass of the scalpel, they were discovering new facts and possibilities about themselves and their mermaid bodies. Agba\u0026rsquo;s lifeless body caught Pat\u0026rsquo;s eye, and she suddenly thought that John or Gabriel would not fit on those tables. She shuddered at this unbidden thought of her pod-mate lying on that table, dead.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you OK? Do you want to take a break?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked, sensing a change in her friend. \u0026ldquo;Emma and I can certainly handle the next hour or so. Why don\u0026rsquo;t you two take a break?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine,\u0026rdquo; Pat said recovering, \u0026ldquo;I was just imagining John lying there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes,\u0026rdquo; Galina agreed. \u0026ldquo;I had a vision of Gabriel earlier. Awful. I can only imagine what Alexis and Liga are going through.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do Petra or Xing talk much about Michael?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, carefully lifting the membrane that formed the barrier around Angara\u0026rsquo;s electrical organs that lay under her dorsal ridge. \u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t ask.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Be careful,\u0026rdquo; Pat warned as Galina exposed the long, thin, gray organs that ran from just below their shoulder blades all the way down to their mid-tail fins.\n\u0026ldquo;I will,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, smiling ruefully.\nThe first time they had probed the series of three long, gray organs on Agba, Galina had gotten a nasty shock that knocked her back several feet. The lesson learned, she approached Angara\u0026rsquo;s set of organs with greater care. Pat lifted back each section of membrane as Galania carefully avoided touching the gray organ itself.\n\u0026ldquo;I think that this array of nerves and cones might actually do more than create the luminescence our tails generate during sex,\u0026rdquo; Pat observed. \u0026ldquo;These cones in the middle are very similar to the cones found in skates and eels, and it would also explain why Agba knocked Galina down.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Skates can shock victims?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Some,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;They can generate enough electricity to stun large predators, even a human.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Galina said ironically.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think this organ is the same one that gives us our mer-senses?\u0026rdquo; Emma speculated.\n\u0026ldquo;Eels have three electrical organs,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, remembering her graduate marine biology classes. \u0026ldquo;One of which is used for electrolocation, which seems to be similar to what our mer-senses do. My guess is that our top organ, here at top of the dorsal ridge, is our mer-sense organ. Come here, and take a look.\u0026rdquo; She pointed with a wooden probe at the small grey mass that rested on the spinal column just below the top of Angara\u0026rsquo;s exposed dorsal ridge. \u0026ldquo;And this middle one, don\u0026rsquo;t touch it, Phoebe, is one that generates electricity, and the bottom one, see how it is connected right there,\u0026rdquo; she said pointing with a wooden probe. \u0026ldquo;May do something else or it may also generate electricity.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wonder if we can tap into it some how?\u0026rdquo; Emma said.\n\u0026ldquo;You mean now?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked. \u0026ldquo;Do you want to get shocked too?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;I mean we could try to generate electricity ourselves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is too dangerous to experiment on ourselves,\u0026rdquo; Galina warned.\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe,\u0026rdquo; Pat asked. \u0026ldquo;Are you ready for me to discharge Angara\u0026rsquo;s organ?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; she replied, moving back to her computer. \u0026ldquo;Emma, maybe we can do this same thing with ourselves?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pay attention, please,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. She waited until Phoebe nodded, and then she pushed the metal probe they had rigged into a ground wire into Angara\u0026rsquo;s middle organ. The computer whirled and a crackle filled the air.\n\u0026ldquo;500 watts just zapped through to the ground,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported. \u0026ldquo;That is enough to stun most anything. Wow.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, wow indeed,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;Is the current fully discharged?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, checking her computer screen, the Cyrillic letters glowing softly on the screen. \u0026ldquo;What I meant was, I think we can do the same experiment on ourselves with electrodes and bio-feedback programs on the computer,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe continued. \u0026ldquo;We can run it through the same circuit we did just now, with Angara, so that we don\u0026rsquo;t fry the computer if we actually generate an electrical charge.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We already are generating an electrical charge,\u0026rdquo; Galina observed. \u0026ldquo;And storing it too, even after we die.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s right,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;The question isn\u0026rsquo;t how to generate the charge, but how to use it. We can\u0026rsquo;t do those experiments now! No one should even think of trying to use your electrical charge, you could hurt yourself or others without meaning to. Remember, all we have to do is think of our child\u0026rsquo;s eyes to become pregnant. So, no thinking! Got it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No thinking until AFTER we get done with these autopsies,\u0026rdquo; Galina added.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe agreed, rubbing her lower back. \u0026ldquo;The sooner we get done, the sooner we can rest.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You could rest now. We\u0026rsquo;re done with Agba,\u0026rdquo; Galina offered. \u0026ldquo;Emma and I can finish Angara.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or we could finish more quickly together,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine, just uncomfortable, but together we can finish the endocrine system, which seems to be the most complex, as far as human versus mer anatomy is concerned. We can decide on names for the two new organs we\u0026rsquo;ve found later, and we need to finish the circulatory and lymphatic systems.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a good idea,\u0026rdquo; Galina agreed. \u0026ldquo;The respiratory systems seem to be identical in males and females, though we still have to name the three new organs in that system: our so-called gills, the new fibers that connect the gill fronds to the bronchial clusters in our lungs, and the vocal nodule that allows us to speak under water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We could just call them gills,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;No we can\u0026rsquo;t, we are a different phyla,\u0026rdquo; Emma teased. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re mammals, not Osteichthyes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oooooh, someone has been studying her biology notes,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;So, they aren\u0026rsquo;t technically gills. What should we call them, Miss Smartypants?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If I could wear pants, I would tell you,\u0026rdquo; Emma said, sticking her tongue out at Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;We can decide later,\u0026rdquo; Galina said. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s finish charting the gender differences in the remaining systems. Emma, which ones are left?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The muscular, skeletal, reproductive, urinary, digestive, immune, intergumentary, and nervous systems are uncharted,\u0026rdquo; Emma said checking her list on the computer.\n\u0026ldquo;We already did cardiovascular?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oops, and cardiovascular,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;And circulatory and lymphatic, too? Do we have to do that with Angara? This time Phoebe and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be the ones who have to mop up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, right,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe agreed, turning green again.\n\u0026ldquo;Take heart, dear one,\u0026rdquo; Pat teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe struggling to remain in control of her rebellious stomach?\n\u0026ldquo;Because despite the mess that we are making, and which you will help clean up, we have discovered that we might be immortal,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;As long as we don\u0026rsquo;t get shot through a major organ, poisoned, or crushed,\u0026rdquo; Galina said.\n\u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Really,\u0026rdquo; Galina answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Who was crushed?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked worriedly.\n\u0026ldquo;No one,\u0026rdquo; Galina said. \u0026ldquo;Yet.\u0026rdquo;\nThey worked quickly, comparing what they had already charted in Agba, looking for key differences that might help them understand how and why the transformations had occurred as they had. They noted the strong cluster of nerve attachments between the lowest electrical organ and the base of spinal column, but they could not trance the function of those connections. When they had done all they could on the dorsal region, all four mers flipped Angara back over, and the autopsy continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Did you actually imagine all this during your transformation?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked a few minutes later, as Pat stretched again, taking a small break from dictating.\n\u0026ldquo;All what?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked.\n\u0026ldquo;All these new organs, electrical sensors, generators, our nanostructured skin and scales, regenerative cells that repair all our systems, including our bones, you know \u0026hellip; all this,\u0026rdquo; Emma said indicating the two dead mers who were now mostly dissected, tagged, and catalogued.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course I did,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said deadpan.\n\u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; Emma challenged. \u0026ldquo;Well, if you could do immortality, then why didn\u0026rsquo;t you do magic?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you really want to go back to legs?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked, exasperated.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe,\u0026rdquo; she said sullenly. \u0026ldquo;I never got much of a chance to be a girl before I became a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, given how sensitive our \u0026ldquo;siren cells\u0026rdquo; are to bioelectrical fields,\u0026rdquo; Galina mused as she lifted a long section of muscle away from Angara\u0026rsquo;s re-shaped leg/tail bones. \u0026ldquo;These mer-organs were probably created by Pat\u0026rsquo;s and John\u0026rsquo;s expertise in marine biology rather than Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s imaginative efforts. So, I would bet that they are more responsible for these new organs.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can we save this speculation until after we get done?\u0026rdquo; Pat chided. \u0026ldquo;We owe Agba and Angara a decent burial, and Alexis and Liga a chance to say goodbye. Let\u0026rsquo;s get finished.\u0026rdquo;\nEric stretched his body out on the beach, enjoying the sun, and tried to catalogue all the changes he had experienced. The girls were out harvesting lunch, insisting on some mermaid-only-time. He thought back to breakfast, when Pat asked him to take his new pod over to the eastern caves. At first, he did not understand her request; he had wanted to get to know his new community a bit more thoroughly, especially John, Gabriel, and MuSu. He had so many questions. After Pat explained what was planned for that morning, he quickly agreed to go. Despite his and Sally\u0026rsquo;s best efforts, however, both Liga and Alexis were melancholy for most of the morning. He had been torn between his concern for and responsibility to his two new pod-mates, and the simple joy and wonder he felt as he ventured out into the open sea for the first time as a merman.\nEverything was more incredible than he ever imagined. His enhanced hearing and sight allowed him to see much further underwater than he thought possible, and his mer-senses gave him a view of the underwater world unlike anything in his previous experiences. Coral was not only red or pink or purple or yellow, it was also alive, with millions of tiny, sparkling points of life, glowing from within. Every living creature seemed to have an inner glow. According to Emma\u0026rsquo;s brief explanation during breakfast on how his mer-senses worked, things should not really be glowing. Maybe it was how his brain processing this new sensory data as \u0026ldquo;light.\u0026rdquo;\nOn the other hand, he really didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the scientific explanations for his new senses; the ocean was more beautiful now than ever before. Sally was more beautiful too, he thought as she surfaced several meters out, making her way ashore. Yes, she had subtly changed during her transformation, but her beauty was more than mere (or mer) physical changes. As she salamandered up the beach, he looked closely at his transformed lover. Her human half was sleeker, trimmer, and shapelier. Her hair was longer, thicker, shinier, and more beautiful, her breasts and lips were fuller, her waist was smaller, and her hips were wider. He knew that he was physically changed too, and he thrilled to the appreciative looks that Sally and the other two mermaids cast on his own body.\nAs she deposited her collection of mollusks and sea grasses nearby, he closed his eyes and remembered their first swim that morning when they entered the open water for the first time. When he focused on swimming and \u0026ldquo;seeing\u0026rdquo; with his mer-senses, the ocean floor was visible to him like a city seen from an airplane at night, thousands of fixed and moving points of light in different shapes and sizes marking coral reefs, fish, anemones, sea grasses, stars, turtles, and many species for which he did not know names. The brightest and clearest points of light were the three mermaids, each a cipher, not mermaid shaped, but still clearly Sally, Alexis, or Liga.\nHe could still \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; his mate with his eyes closed, and lifted his cheek so that she could give him a quick kiss before she waddled back into the water. He reopened his eyes and watched her shapely form disappear beneath the waves with a final flap of her beautiful blue and silver flukes. When he \u0026ldquo;looked\u0026rdquo; at each of his mates, he knew he wasn\u0026rsquo;t seeing their identities, per se, but rather he was seeing a network of energies some of which were literally connected to his own body. Even now, he could see whispers of light—tiny, microscopic tendrils of energy—that constantly moved among and between the four of them. He could see them now stretching from his body across the beach towards all three mermaids, twisting and swirling as they left his body and reached out into the sea.\nHe realized that he was seeing their literal connections. Mermaid bonding was not merely emotional or spiritual, it was physical, measurable, and it was visible to his mer-senses. It was beautiful.\nIt was like being able to \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; love.\nHe closed his eyes and \u0026ldquo;watched\u0026rdquo; his mates who were underwater, as they turned and slowly and gracefully started swimming towards the beach. They surfaced, laden with food. He opened his eyes and watched them waddle up onto the beach. Even Liga, who was visibly pregnant, was still a sexy mermaid, he thought as he watched her salamander towards him. He looked at all three of his mermaids, their bodies and tails undulating over the sand, and he could still \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; the inner glows that signaled their feelings and emotions. Earlier in the morning, when he and Sally were relatively subdued, he could only see Sally\u0026rsquo;s glow clearly. Later, after the recent mer-widows insisted on playing together in the water so that he and Sally could get to know their new bodies, he began to see Alexis and Liga\u0026rsquo;s inner glow more clearly.\nHe smiled as Sally handed him some oysters, remembering that morning\u0026rsquo;s first twinkling of the sheer joy of mer-life, besides his new mates, of course. The discovery of power and strength in his new body was intoxicating. His flukes and fins responded effortlessly to his intentions, allowing him to swim with great speed and agility. Sally had been equally intoxicated, and she nearly matched him in speed and power. She made up for her smaller size with even greater agility and efficiency in her strokes and maneuvers. She was a born swimmer.\nAs they finished their lunch, Eric could see Sally\u0026rsquo;s strong connection to him. He knew that they had something special, and that the sex was fantastic when they were human. Last night, it had been even better as mers. He looked over at Alexis and Liga and saw that they were growing more attached to both him and Sally with each passing moment. He could see their electrical patterns changing, and thin tendrils of light reaching out between him and them, fusing their bodies and souls together. He caught Alexis' eyes, and he noticed that both Alexis and Liga were now looking at him differently than they did last night or even this morning.\nHis heart actually pounded harder in his chest as he contemplated the love these mermaids were projecting towards him. He realized, at that moment, that he would lay down his own life without hesitation to protect his mates.\nAfter they cleaned up the shells and bones of their lunch, the four of them lay together on the small, sandy beach. Eric\u0026rsquo;s head was resting on Sally\u0026rsquo;s lap, his flukes floating in the warm water as it rushed back and forth along his tail. Alexis was behind Sally, braiding Sally\u0026rsquo;s hair, while Liga rested half in and out of the water, her head resting along Eric\u0026rsquo;s tail, her arm draped across his mid-tail fins.\n\u0026ldquo;When do you think we should head back?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked Alexis.\n\u0026ldquo;Not until dinnertime,\u0026rdquo; she said with only the slightest hesitation. \u0026ldquo;Autopsies take time, especially when you are doing an unfamiliar species.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You seem less upset than I thought you would be,\u0026rdquo; Sally said.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s because I now have you and Eric in my life,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, pulling Sally\u0026rsquo;s braid tight. \u0026ldquo;I thought I would die, at first, the pain seemed so great \u0026hellip; so physical. But after last night, the hole in my heart got smaller and smaller, filling up with you two. Now, it feels almost filled.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The pain was physical,\u0026rdquo; Eric said. \u0026ldquo;I bet it felt like strings were being ripped out from your body.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, that is exactly how it felt,\u0026rdquo; Liga said, looking up at her new podmates. \u0026ldquo;How did you know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can see the strings that flow between us,\u0026rdquo; Eric said. \u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean by see?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I mean that I can see glowing threads of light going between us,\u0026rdquo; Eric answered.\n\u0026ldquo;You mean right now?\u0026rdquo; asked Liga.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I can see them better when we are in the water,\u0026rdquo; Eric said. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you see them too?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Alexis answered as Liga shook her head as well. \u0026ldquo;I can sense the presence of others, but I don\u0026rsquo;t see anything like a thread.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about you, Sally?\u0026rdquo; Eric asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I can sense each of you,\u0026rdquo; Sally answered. \u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t see any glowing bits of light.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I do,\u0026rdquo; Eric said. \u0026ldquo;And it\u0026rsquo;s beautiful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you see anything now?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; he answered, closing his eyes. \u0026ldquo;But when we are out of the water, I can see only a few tendrils of light coming from each of you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do they look like?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked, all business as she finished Sally\u0026rsquo;s braid.\nEric concentrated for a moment, then he opened his eyes and looked down at Liga, then up at Sally and Alexis as they loomed over his head.\n\u0026ldquo;There are two main threads from each of you that go into each of us, six threads total leaving our bodies,\u0026rdquo; Eric explained as he traced a finger along a swirling thread of light out from his chest to Sally\u0026rsquo;s chest. \u0026ldquo;One goes to our chests and the other to our flukes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;Chest to chest and fluke to fluke?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yep,\u0026rdquo; Eric answered. \u0026ldquo;Chest threads are white, and fluke threads are a mixture of the colors of our tails.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone\u0026rsquo;s chest threads are white?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Eric answered. \u0026ldquo;And the fluke thread leaves your tail a swirl of pink and white and about halfway to mine it mixes with my blue and silver, but our colors sometimes shoot all the way back and forth.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And my fluke thread to Liga goes from blue and silver to black and white?\u0026rdquo; asked Sally.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Eric answered. \u0026ldquo;But our thread is blue and silver along the entire length.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wonder what that means,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said.\n\u0026ldquo;It means that we are connected,\u0026rdquo; Liga said.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course it means we\u0026rsquo;re connected,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said with a smile to her sister-wife. \u0026ldquo;But maybe those threads and colors mean more?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Our tails light up when we have sex,\u0026rdquo; Liga reminded her. \u0026ldquo;Maybe Eric\u0026rsquo;s threads are connected to our bio-luminescence. If they are, then our luminescence is electrical, not chemical.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Liga!\u0026rdquo; Alexis gushed. \u0026ldquo;You have been learning about science. I think you may be right. Eric, do the threads look like the lights in our tails?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure,\u0026rdquo; Eric said, blushing, remembering their heated and repeated couplings last night. \u0026ldquo;Last night, you guys were in charge, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t really see our tails.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are always in charge,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;But maybe you will see our tails in greater detail shortly,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, kissing the back of Sally\u0026rsquo;s neck.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s different,\u0026rdquo; Sally said, shivering.\n\u0026ldquo;Did you like it?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked, her lips moving lightly across Sally\u0026rsquo;s soft skin.\n\u0026ldquo;I think so,\u0026rdquo; Sally said, her breathing quickening. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never \u0026hellip; um \u0026hellip; never.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe those threads are why it was so painful when Agba and Angara died,\u0026rdquo; Liga said. \u0026ldquo;Maybe our new threads with Sally and Eric are why the pain is going away.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; um \u0026hellip;. ah \u0026hellip; I hope you feel no pain soon,\u0026rdquo; Sally said, smiling down at Liga, trying to ignore the feelings that Alexis' caresses were prompting. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s been only a very short time, but I know that we are connected, even if I can\u0026rsquo;t see threads. I am starting to feel things towards you and Alexis that I\u0026rsquo;ve \u0026hellip; um \u0026hellip; never felt towards another woman \u0026hellip; er \u0026hellip; mermaid before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What feelings are those?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked, slowly taking Sally\u0026rsquo;s braid back out, stroking her hair with her fingers.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure,\u0026rdquo; Sally said, glancing into Eric\u0026rsquo;s face, trying to figure out what she felt. \u0026ldquo;I think I love you just like I love Eric: emotionally, physically, everything. Does that make me a lesbian?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It makes you a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Liga said. \u0026ldquo;Sometimes I wanted only Alexis or Angara, sometimes I wanted only Agba, and sometimes I wanted all three of them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just Alexis?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked with a nervous laugh.\n\u0026ldquo;Does mer-sexuality frighten you?\u0026rdquo; Alexis continued, taking one strand of Sally\u0026rsquo;s thick hair and reaching around her sister-wife to brush the underside of Sally\u0026rsquo;s breasts with her own hair.\n\u0026ldquo;No \u0026hellip;ooooh,\u0026rdquo; Sally said.\n\u0026ldquo;Should I stop?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, ah, ummmm, you can keep doing that for as long as you like,\u0026rdquo; Sally said as she leaned back into Alexis' embrace. \u0026ldquo;If that\u0026rsquo;s alright with you, Eric?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alexis, I order you to continue stroking Sally\u0026rsquo;s breasts,\u0026rdquo; Eric said smiling. \u0026ldquo;Sally, I order you to enjoy it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s not in charge,\u0026rdquo; Alexis whispered in Sally\u0026rsquo;s ear, pressing her own breasts against Sally\u0026rsquo;s back. \u0026ldquo;But I like doing it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This feels quick,\u0026rdquo; Liga observed as she watched Alexis seduce their new mate.\n\u0026ldquo;Too quick?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked, worriedly.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Liga said, stroking Eric\u0026rsquo;s tail with her fingernails, causing pleasant tremors to run up and down his soft, smooth, scales. \u0026ldquo;It feels good quick. But it is quicker than before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, as she lifted her other hand forward to cup Sally\u0026rsquo;s other breast. \u0026ldquo;But why?\u0026rdquo; she pondered as Sally moaned in pleasure.\n\u0026ldquo;Eric and Sally sought us,\u0026rdquo; Liga answered. \u0026ldquo;Angara and Agba sought escape, and we were an accident. Our new mates wanted to be mers, and we needed new mates, so the bond was quick and good.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you think?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked as she gently pulled on Sally\u0026rsquo;s nipple, lifting her full round breast up and away from her chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Quick is \u0026hellip; aaah \u0026hellip; good,\u0026rdquo; she said, her breathing deepening and quickening.\n\u0026ldquo;Eric is a big, fine, new mate,\u0026rdquo; Liga said, inserting a finger into Eric\u0026rsquo;s vent, and blowing into the pocket in which his cock was hidden.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, don\u0026rsquo;t do that,\u0026rdquo; Eric said with a groan.\n\u0026ldquo;Why not?\u0026rdquo; Liga asked with a giggle.\n\u0026ldquo;Because I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to control myself,\u0026rdquo; he answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Liga said as she reached into his now open vent and helped fish out his quickly stiffening cock. \u0026ldquo;I will control you. We like being in control, remember?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You go right ahead,\u0026rdquo; Eric panted as he felt her warm mouth encircle his slowly stiffening cock.\nSally looked down at her mate and lover, watching the dark haired mermaid stroke and suck on Eric\u0026rsquo;s long cock. Liga was beautiful, lying in the surf, her velvet black tail shimmering in the sun, the white fringes along her fins, flukes, and dorsal ridge fluttering in the water. Liga\u0026rsquo;s hair was a thick, lustrous cloud of black that flowed over her shoulders, down her shapely back, and draped over Eric\u0026rsquo;s hips. Sally looked down at her own tail, so beautiful, so blue, and identical to Eric\u0026rsquo;s.\nShe stroked Eric\u0026rsquo;s hair as he closed his eyes to enjoy what Liga was doing to him, and she could feel her own vulva swell with passion as Alexis continued to stroke her breasts. She had never had a sexual thought about a woman before, and now she wanted to touch and caress and stroke every part of both Alexis and Liga. She could feel Alexis' large breasts pushed into her gills, and her own breasts felt heavy and full with passion and mermaid milk. She shivered at the memory of the previous evening, when she had her first mermaid orgasm. She was surprised when her breasts started spurting milk into the water, and she was also surprised by the intense feelings generated by her newly enlarged breasts, ones similar to the tingles of pleasure Alexis was generating.\n\u0026ldquo;I want some desert,\u0026rdquo; Liga said in between slurps. \u0026ldquo;Alexis, why don\u0026rsquo;t you give Sally some desert?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a great idea,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said as she pulled Sally into an embrace and rolled them a few centimeters away from Liga and her prey.\nEric let his head fall back onto the damp sand as he felt Alexis and Sally roll away from him. He savored the warm water as it washed along his now quivering tail, cresting in small waves along his shoulders, his fins and flukes were fully extended, while the petite Filipino mermaid lavished attention upon his stiff cock. She beat it against her face, and licked it like a lollipop. Then she gave it several vigorous strokes along its entire length, and returned it to her mouth, taking nearly half of it down her throat. He knew he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t last long.\nSally was equally engaged, writhing under Alexis, feeling the blond mermaid\u0026rsquo;s soft weight pressing onto her, her tongue teasing Sally\u0026rsquo;s now swollen and exposed clit and labia. She put her arms around Alexis' tail, reaching up to her dorsal ridge, running her fingers over the soft fringe that ran along her spine. Alexis swayed above Sally, suspended on her pelvic fins and flukes, moving her hips gently back and forth over her face. Sally gasped as Alexis' belly rubbed across her stiff nipples, and she pulled Alexis' hips down to her face, tasting the other mermaid for the first time.\nEric glanced over at Sally\u0026rsquo;s gasp, and watched them grappling in the mermaid equivalent of a 69, their bodies both quivering and twitching, as their faces were buried in one another\u0026rsquo;s vents. Even in the bright sun, he could now see the tremors of light running up and down their tails as they squirmed against one another. The flickering blue, silver, pink and white lights that shimmered along their tails were, indeed, very much like the threads of light that joined them all. Eric lifted his head and saw that both Liga and he were also luminescent, his flukes in particular were flickering and twitching, and they were beautiful.\nHe laid his head back down, savoring Liga\u0026rsquo;s enthusiastic attention to his now throbbing cock. He turned to look again at the other mermaids and saw Sally\u0026rsquo;s head turn away from Alexis' vent, making eye contact with him. The thread that flowed between them pulsed, and he felt a sudden orgasm rise from his mid-tail and explode into Liga\u0026rsquo;s eager embrace. Sally\u0026rsquo;s eyes rolled back in her head as she too, joined him in orgasm.\nHe closed his eyes, and savored the long pulses of cum that splashed into Liga\u0026rsquo;s warm mouth. He heard Alexis vocally signify that she too had joined him in this moment of bliss. When he recovered, he turned his attention to Liga. As he listened to her squeal his name as his tongue pushed her over the edge again and again, he could also feel Alexis and Sally join her in similar orgasms. When the girls recovered, Eric could see that the connection between Sally and Alexis had grown more substantial, and his own connection to Liga pulsed with greater energy.\n\u0026ldquo;You can really see a difference?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; he answered, stroking Liga\u0026rsquo;s fins as she shuddered and cooed in post-orgasmic bliss.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go out into the water,\u0026rdquo; Sally suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;O.K., but why?\u0026rdquo; Eric asked. \u0026ldquo;Liga is still recovering.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because then we can do a round robin,\u0026rdquo; Sally said.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s a round robin?\u0026rdquo; Liga asked, still enjoying the fading tremors of her own orgasm.\n\u0026ldquo;We keep switching partners until each of us has made love to everyone individually,\u0026rdquo; Sally explained, looking at Liga. \u0026ldquo;That way, the new bonds can be built among each of us as quickly and as strongly as possible.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m recovered enough for that!\u0026rdquo; Liga said, rolling towards the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Good!\u0026rdquo; Sally said as she splashed joyfully in pursuit of the petite mermaid, her mermaid sexuality fully awakened.\nEric watched the two mermaids race into the water, playfully caressing and teasing one another. Suddenly he felt the force of a mermaid tackling him from behind, rolling him into the water. Alexis pulled his face to hers and kissed him soundly as they spun into the water. He could taste Sally\u0026rsquo;s juices on Alexis' tongue as it swirled in his mouth. As soon as there was enough water under them, she swam them both out to deeper water, propelling them down towards an underwater rock.\n\u0026ldquo;Seaman Edwards, I order you to suck my nipples,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said playfully, pulling Eric\u0026rsquo;s face from her lips and guiding him towards her aching breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Merman Edwards, if you please, and I\u0026rsquo;ll only do it if I\u0026rsquo;m ordered to enjoy it,\u0026rdquo; he said as she thrust her stiff nipple into his mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;Enjoy it, Edwards,\u0026rdquo; Alexis hissed as his teeth bit down lightly on her stiff nipple.\nEric sucked the warm mermaid milk from Alexis; her orgasm with Sally prompted a prodigious amount of liquid. It was sweet, and he was enjoying sucking on her firm breasts. Not being in charge was going to be easy, he thought as he pulled on his vent muscle to free his quickly rebounding cock. Mermaid milk was better than Viagra.\nThey made several rounds that afternoon because someone would \u0026ldquo;accidentally\u0026rdquo; start a new round, and then the other two would be behind an orgasm or two, but no one really seemed to mind. Later that evening, after a post-dinner round (their sixth of the day) they rested entwined around Eric, floating about five meters below the surface. Alexis belatedly remembered that they were supposed to be at a meeting of all the mers to debrief the autopsies. They rushed back to the caves, but no one chided them for being late. Although Eric alone could see the strong, thick threads of light that threaded their way through his entire pod, all the mers could see the looks on their faces, and that was excuse enough for their tardiness.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a boat,\u0026rdquo; Emma exclaimed.\n\u0026ldquo;Another one?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe sighed, looking into the morning sun. \u0026ldquo;So soon?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What did you find out?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, lifting herself onto the beach of the lagoon.\n\u0026ldquo;The Freedom III, from San Francisco,\u0026rdquo; MuSu answered.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know anyone from San Francisco,\u0026rdquo; Sally worried, looking at Eric.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m from LA,\u0026rdquo; he said, shrugging his shoulders.\n\u0026ldquo;There were six people on board,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said. \u0026ldquo;Three men and three women.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We think it\u0026rsquo;s a family,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said.\n\u0026ldquo;That tall blond guy and the two girls are siblings, but the dark-haired boy must be a friend,\u0026rdquo; Emma argued.\n\u0026ldquo;You weren\u0026rsquo;t spotted?\u0026rdquo; Gabriel asked apprehensively, holding Michelle in his arms.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; MuSu answered. \u0026ldquo;But only just barely,\u0026rdquo; he finished with a glare at Emma.\n\u0026ldquo;We needed to—\u0026rdquo; she started to argue.\n\u0026ldquo;Relax, everyone!\u0026rdquo; John said firmly. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Hank and Janice Connor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And their kids,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;And the tall blond guy is probably Trevor Green, if memory serves.\u0026rdquo;\nEveryone blinked at Pat and John for a moment, the late morning sun beating down on the beach. After a breath or two of silence, everyone started talking and asking questions at once. It took several minutes to get all the information out and for everyone to settle back down.\n\u0026ldquo;So, these are friends of yours from Greenpeace who are looking for you?\u0026rdquo; Petra concluded as everyone listened.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;Though they are likely to be surprised by what they find.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No kidding,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said in a deadpan.\n\u0026ldquo;The dark-haired boy is the girls' brother?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked. \u0026ldquo;No way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, brother or not, the boat will be here in about an hour or so, depending on the wind,\u0026rdquo; MuSu observed. \u0026ldquo;We need a plan.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re going to do,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\nHank nosed the Freedom III into the lagoon on the south side of 399, one of the larger islands on their possible targets list for finding his brother-in-law. Janice and the girls were at the bow, eagerly scanning the island with their binoculars, while Robbie and Trevor readied the dinghy at the stern of the boat. The noonday sun was bright and clear, the light dancing across the beach and water.\n\u0026ldquo;There are beach huts!\u0026rdquo; Kate exclaimed, her long blonde hair swirling around her face as she pushed it away from her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Where?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked, swinging her gaze away from the volcano that rose majestically up along the western edge of the picturesque island.\n\u0026ldquo;One-o\u0026rsquo;clock,\u0026rdquo; Ann said, joining in her sister\u0026rsquo;s excitement.\n\u0026ldquo;I see them,\u0026rdquo; Janice shouted. \u0026ldquo;Hank, there are beach huts!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who built them?\u0026rdquo; he thought to himself, wondering if he should get his gun from the cabin below.\n\u0026ldquo;Look, in the water, 11 o\u0026rsquo;clock,\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a man swimming. It looks like John. No, wait, it can\u0026rsquo;t be \u0026hellip; but \u0026hellip; wait \u0026hellip; it is John, but he looks younger than I remember.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Janice said with surprise and relief as she focused her glasses on the bobbing figure in the water. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s John, and he does look ten years younger.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And more handsome,\u0026rdquo; Ann said, quickly embarrassed that she had said it out loud. She dropped her binoculars to her side and turned to face the stern. \u0026ldquo;For an old guy,\u0026rdquo; she stuttered, looking at Trevor.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll remember to tell him that when we get closer,\u0026rdquo; Hank said with a wry smile and a nudge in Trevor\u0026rsquo;s side. \u0026ldquo;Janice, can you hail him?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;JOHN!\u0026rdquo; Janice screamed, waving. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Janice and Hank!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey sis!\u0026rdquo; John\u0026rsquo;s voice floated back to them over the water.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s great to see you,\u0026rdquo; she shouted back. \u0026ldquo;Where\u0026rsquo;s Patrick?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pat is out collecting samples on the other side of the island,\u0026rdquo; John said, watching the boat veer towards his location.\n\u0026ldquo;In your boat?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked as they made more speed for the beach, now that they knew it was safe.\n\u0026ldquo;No, our boat is gone,\u0026rdquo; John said, bobbing in the wake of the sailboat as it swung into the wind.\n\u0026ldquo;What happened to your boat?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a long story,\u0026rdquo; John said, as the sailboat slowed.\n\u0026ldquo;Trevor, radio the Sea Dancer and let them know we\u0026rsquo;ve found John and Patrick on 399,\u0026rdquo; Hank said.\n\u0026ldquo;Rodger,\u0026rdquo; Trevor responded, ducking into the galley.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you need a hand up into the boat?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked as they drew with in a few meters of the still floating John. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s happened to your eyes?\u0026rdquo; she asked, noticing the jewel-like quality of his flashing grey/green eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s another long story, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you\u0026rsquo;ll eventually hear all about it,\u0026rdquo; John said with a smile, \u0026ldquo;but go ahead and anchor and make landfall. Who is on The Sea Dancer?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Bill and Mae Williams,\u0026rdquo; Janice answered. \u0026ldquo;You remember them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; John answered. \u0026ldquo;Anyone else?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mae\u0026rsquo;s sister, Eve,\u0026rdquo; Janice answered. \u0026ldquo;And Sandy and Dawn Halbst.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sandy and Dawn?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s their first voyage with us,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;Why all the questions? What\u0026rsquo;s up?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Like I said, it\u0026rsquo;s a long story,\u0026rdquo; John grinned. \u0026ldquo;But it\u0026rsquo;s a good one. Can they be trusted to keep a secret?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This search for you is a secret, remember?\u0026rdquo; Hank answered. \u0026ldquo;Are you o.k.?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine,\u0026rdquo; John reassured them. \u0026ldquo;Listen, you get to the beach, and I\u0026rsquo;ll go get Pat. It will take about thirty minutes to get back. Just remember, you need to be ready for the surprise of your life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What the heck do you mean by that?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked from the stern as he swung the tiller to allow Janice to set the anchor, which she had already lowered into the water.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll see,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;But I warn you, it will be a big shocker. Just trust me, and don\u0026rsquo;t shoot us. You should be on the beach when I return.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Shoot you,\u0026rdquo; Hank said laughing, \u0026ldquo;why on earth would we want to shoot you and Patrick?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Promise me?\u0026rdquo; John said with a hint of seriousness.\n\u0026ldquo;Fine, fine,\u0026rdquo; Hank said laughing, \u0026ldquo;We won\u0026rsquo;t shoot you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How is he going to make it to the other side of the island and back in thirty minutes?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked, scanning the length of the island.\nJanice watched as John sank quickly below the surface, and she noticed that he looked very different under the water. She saw for the first time that his outline was much longer than she expected, and that he shot under their boat much faster than she thought a human could swim. There was also a flash of steel and blue and quicksilver along his legs as he passed beneath the boat. A sudden fear clutched at her heart.\n\u0026ldquo;Hank,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;John\u0026rsquo;s changed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course he\u0026rsquo;s strange,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s been on this island for nearly two years with only Patrick for company.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, not strange, changed,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, her fear building. \u0026ldquo;He has really changed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked, sensing her fear. \u0026ldquo;Do you think the radioactivity has affected him?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;Kate, what were the readings as we approached?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They were all within normal parameters, normal background radiation,\u0026rdquo; Kate said.\n\u0026ldquo;He hasn\u0026rsquo;t come up for air yet,\u0026rdquo; Ann said as she scanned the lagoon in the direction in which John had headed.\n\u0026ldquo;Girls, did you see anything strange about John?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;Not really.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Me neither,\u0026rdquo; Ann agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Where did he go?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Under the boat,\u0026rdquo; Janice answered. \u0026ldquo;He was headed for the reef, swimming much faster than any human I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen swim.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Human?\u0026rdquo; asked Hank.\n\u0026ldquo;He looked like he had a fish tail,\u0026rdquo; Janice said.\n\u0026ldquo;What, like a mermaid?\u0026rdquo; Hank laughed.\n\u0026ldquo;No, like a merman,\u0026rdquo; Janice said.\nThere was a moment of silence, only the sound of the waves lapping along the hull of their boat, and the wind rustling the sails.\n\u0026ldquo;He did say we would be shocked,\u0026rdquo; Hank said.\n\u0026ldquo;And then you arrived,\u0026rdquo; John finished, looking across the fire to where his in-laws sat in stunned silence.\nThe mers were all arranged by pods with their backs to the water, while Hank, Janice, and Trevor sat on camp chairs on the other side of the fire. Their three children had moved among the mers, and the girls were stroking John\u0026rsquo;s fins and flukes, while Robbie was holding Michelle who was sleeping in his arms. It had taken the rest of the afternoon and part of the evening to answer everyone\u0026rsquo;s questions.\n\u0026ldquo;And you think that you\u0026rsquo;ve become immortal?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps not immortal,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;But the aging process has been slowed considerably, we think.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve studied individual cells in all our major biological systems,\u0026rdquo; Galina explained, \u0026ldquo;and the regenerative properties of our new \u0026ldquo;siren cell,\u0026rdquo; which exists in mermaid milk and our reproductive fluids, affects all systems similarly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re still not sure how it works, but it rebuilds and reshapes cells, bone, nerve, blood, DNA, everything,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;It operates like a stem cell, sort of. Rather than it becoming any other cell, it helps other cells become any other cell. Two new organs in our endocrine system make it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It also made us younger. I was 56 years old before I transitioned,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel offered.\n\u0026ldquo;And he was a woman,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, taking her mate\u0026rsquo;s hand. \u0026ldquo;And I was nearly 60, and a male.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, yes, there were a few steps in between before we got to being mermaids,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;And now you all look twenty-five,\u0026rdquo; Hank observed.\n\u0026ldquo;Siren cell,\u0026rdquo; John said with a smile, \u0026ldquo;I like it. Good name for it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t know about it John? When did you discover it?\u0026rdquo; asked Janice.\n\u0026ldquo;A few months ago, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t understand what it was or how it got produced until this morning,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;The autopsies.\u0026rdquo; Janice looked over at Eric\u0026rsquo;s pod. \u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Alexis reassured her, taking Liga\u0026rsquo;s and Sally\u0026rsquo;s hands in hers. \u0026ldquo;We have new mates now, and the knowledge we gained from our old mates will help us. We can bury them tonight with great dignity and honor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Angie?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Angara and Agba,\u0026rdquo; Liga answered, clear-eyed but sad. \u0026ldquo;They were killed protecting us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is time to honor their sacrifice,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;We will post MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod at the entrance to the lagoon tonight, and all of us will return here in the morning. Why don\u0026rsquo;t you get some rest in the huts, and we can talk further after some reflection.\u0026rdquo;\nHank and Janice agreed, and watched as the mers made their way into the water. Hank returned his attention to the fire, watching the flames lick against the driftwood, the occasional spark rising into the darkness. He felt his wife\u0026rsquo;s hand slip into his own.\n\u0026ldquo;Penny for your thoughts?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;There isn\u0026rsquo;t enough money in the universe,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, looking across at his children and Trevor, all of whom were eagerly waiting for his response. \u0026ldquo;All this is just beyond me, beyond anything I expected.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Dad,\u0026rdquo; Kate began.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Hank said with a sigh. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s written like a neon sign on all your faces, and the answer is no.\u0026rdquo;\nHis three children erupted at once. They all wanted to stay, and they wanted to become mers.\n\u0026ldquo;Were any of you listening?\u0026rdquo; Hank shouted, quieting them. \u0026ldquo;First, there is some crazy drug lord who is hunting them down. Second, the US Navy will be breathing down their necks any day now. Third, the ratio is 3 females to 1male—ideally—which means that at least one male among us would need to change into a woman, and \u0026hellip; AND,\u0026rdquo; he raised his voice as he saw their arguments rise in their throats. \u0026ldquo;AND, fourth, I am not going to have any kind of incestuous relationship with my own children, human or mer!\u0026rdquo;\nEveryone sat in silence while they did the math.\n\u0026ldquo;I could become a mermaid to go with Janice and Hank,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not related by blood to the rest of you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That might work,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said hopefully. \u0026ldquo;You could be with Dad, and I would have Kate and Ann.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ewwwe,\u0026rdquo; Kate and Ann said together. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re our brother!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be a girl,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said carefully.\n\u0026ldquo;NO!\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;No one is going to be a girl or a mermaid. Furthermore, Robbie is NOT going to be a father to his sister\u0026rsquo;s children.\u0026rdquo;\nAnother few moments of awkward silence passed.\n\u0026ldquo;What will we do?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but we can talk about it more in the morning,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;Tomorrow is likely to be a big day, one way or the other, and we should all try to get some rest.\u0026rdquo;\nLater that night, Trevor found Robbie alone on the beach, watching waves roll onto the shore in the darkness.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey,\u0026rdquo; Trevor whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t sleep?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nope,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said as he sat down beside the younger man.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry about the mermaid/girl thing,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said.\n\u0026ldquo;What mermaid/girl thing?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You know, the ‘that might work' thing?\u0026rdquo; Robbie answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, that,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said. He looked out at the waves for a moment or two.\n\u0026ldquo;Would you become a mermaid?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Me; you mean become a girl?\u0026rdquo; Robbie said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, would you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Would you?\u0026rdquo; Robbie returned.\n\u0026ldquo;I asked you first,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said.\nThey sat in silence for a while, each lost in thought.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said.\n\u0026ldquo;Me neither,\u0026rdquo; Trevor answered.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;d be a merman husband to my sisters, though?\u0026rdquo; Robbie asked.\n\u0026ldquo;In a heartbeat,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said good-naturedly. \u0026ldquo;But not without your Dad\u0026rsquo;s permission.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, that would be bad,\u0026rdquo; Robbie agreed. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;d kill you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said. \u0026ldquo;But it would hurt, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure.\u0026rdquo;\nThere was silence again as the boys watched the sea in the moonlight.\n\u0026ldquo;Would you be a merman husband to your sisters?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Nah,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said. \u0026ldquo;I just wanted to stay and be a mer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said.\nTrevor sat next to the younger boy in silence again. His thoughts were all a whirl. The mers were the most beautiful creatures that he had ever seen, and the grace and beauty with which all the mermaids moved, swam, and even talked was completely captivating. Their voices were like silver bells, and their laughter was like music. They were indeed sirens of the sea. He had to find a way to become a part of the mers, and it had to be sooner rather than later.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think your dad would let me stay?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;He might,\u0026rdquo; Robbie answered. \u0026ldquo;I mean, technically you\u0026rsquo;re not his kid, and you\u0026rsquo;re twenty five years old.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s twice you\u0026rsquo;ve said good,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said. \u0026ldquo;What are you hatching in that addled brain of yours?\u0026rdquo; he asked, chucking his old friend in the shoulder.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m gonna stay,\u0026rdquo; Trevor announced.\n\u0026ldquo;You need a girl to stay, remember,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said. \u0026ldquo;Mermen need at least one girl or they get crazy. That\u0026rsquo;s what Emma said. And, all the current pods are full.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe one will turn up?\u0026rdquo; Trevor said hopefully.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said, turning his gaze to the moon.\n\u0026ldquo;Where the hell is my daughter?\u0026rdquo; Admiral Mackenzie \u0026ldquo;Mac\u0026rdquo; Bennett bellowed.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know sir,\u0026rdquo; the young officer said, wishing that he were anywhere else on the planet.\n\u0026ldquo;What the fuck does that mean, I don\u0026rsquo;t know?\u0026rdquo; His voice ringing down the long hallways of the Naval Annex. \u0026ldquo;Call those assholes over at Homeland Security and get some answers, and then call State and see if there has been any activity on her passport.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can do that?\u0026rdquo; the Lieutenant asked nervously.\n\u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; the admiral growled as he loomed over the shorter, younger man. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll be busted back to Seaman so fast that pond scum will out rank you. Go!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aye, aye sir,\u0026rdquo; the young man squeaked as he dashed from the Admiral\u0026rsquo;s office.\nDamn fool girl, he fumed. She was always wanting to some impulsive thing, and now she had, finally. Heck, he almost admired her for it. It showed some balls to double cross her old man that way, sneaking off with out so much as a how-do-you-do. Probably shacking up with that surfer, what was his name? Eric, damn him! Once he got his hands on that sonofabitch, he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have legs to stand on a surfboard.\nWhy couldn\u0026rsquo;t he have had a son? If a son of his ran off with a pretty girl despite his objections, he might have bought the fool a cigar for finally standing up to his bluster. But a girl \u0026hellip; girls were different! He had tried his best, after his wife had died in childbirth, to raise Sally. When she was a little girl, she adored him, but after she turned twelve, she became a creature he didn\u0026rsquo;t understand. Damn women!\nNo, damn Eric! It had to be his fault. The Admiral picked up his phone.\n\u0026ldquo;CIA, headquarters,\u0026rdquo; he barked into the phone.\n\u0026ldquo;Bill is probably about three or four weeks out,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;We have to get back now, especially since we are not going to rescue anyone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But why?\u0026rdquo; Kate whined. \u0026ldquo;We want to stay. We have only been here for two days, and you said we were going to be here for a week.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Plans have changed,\u0026rdquo; Hank said simply.\n\u0026ldquo;But why?\u0026rdquo; Ann chimed in. \u0026ldquo;Is it because of that meeting you all had this morning?\u0026rdquo;\nHank sighed. He struggled with how much to tell his own children about the meeting he and Janice had with Pat and John. But he couldn\u0026rsquo;t let anyone know what they had decided.\n\u0026ldquo;We are going back,\u0026rdquo; he repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;But why do we have to go?\u0026rdquo; Kate repeated. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re both 18!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not for another two weeks,\u0026rdquo; Hank said evenly.\n\u0026ldquo;We are going back because you two are going to get a college education, whether you like it or not,\u0026rdquo; Janice said.\n\u0026ldquo;So, that order to go back might not include me?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Or me?\u0026rdquo; Robbie added. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve already got our college degrees.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And we want to stay and help with the gun,\u0026rdquo; Trevor added, glancing over at Gabriel who smiled guiltily.\nHank glared at Gabriel who shrugged. He swung his gaze back to his son and his former intern. They were both young, strapping boys, and they could probably help a great deal. He understood their desire, but he hesitated on giving his consent.\n\u0026ldquo;And it would give you the excuse you needed to return,\u0026rdquo; Robbie added as he watched his father struggle with his decision.\n\u0026ldquo;What excuse do I need?\u0026rdquo; Hank growled.\n\u0026ldquo;To tell your friends that you need to visit me,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said. \u0026ldquo;Besides, I know you and Mom, and the girls. You\u0026rsquo;ll be back; the possibility of becoming mers is too much to turn away from. Think how much we could accomplish environmentally as ambassadors from the sea, and we can only do that if there are enough of us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you going to become a mermaid or a merman?\u0026rdquo; Janice challenged, glaring at both Robbie and Trevor.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not becoming mer anythings for a while. At least for a month or so, while we help with the gun and stuff.\u0026rdquo;\nA few moments passed while Hank and Janice whispered fiercely to one another.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not saying yes,\u0026rdquo; Hank said.\n\u0026ldquo;But he\u0026rsquo;s not saying no,\u0026rdquo; Janice added. \u0026ldquo;You two can make your own decisions, but we would like you to return with us. You are right, we will be coming back.\u0026rdquo;\nTrevor and Robbie shared a quick glance, while his sisters squealed with joy.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m staying,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said.\n\u0026ldquo;Me too,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not fair,\u0026rdquo; Kate exclaimed.\n\u0026ldquo;Life, even a mermaid\u0026rsquo;s life, is not always fair,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, offering a comforting smile to the two young girls. \u0026ldquo;We will welcome you back when you are older.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But you must promise to keep this a secret,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, waddling over to them and taking their hands in hers. \u0026ldquo;Please promise me that you\u0026rsquo;ll not tell anyone until your father says that it\u0026rsquo;s o.k.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We promise,\u0026rdquo; the girls both said solemnly.\nHank and Janice had spent the rest of the day with all the mers in the Western Caves, except for MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod who kept the Connor children and Trevor company. Trevor and Robbie were given the task of replenishing the boat\u0026rsquo;s supplies and informing the Sea Dancer of their plans. The Sea Dancer was advised to continue to 399, as John and \u0026ldquo;Pat\u0026rdquo; had need of some of their supplies, which is what Hank told Trevor to tell Bill, and no other details.\n\u0026ldquo;Why are you guys always the ones on guard duty?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked as she stroked Emma\u0026rsquo;s fins.\n\u0026ldquo;Because we\u0026rsquo;re the only pod that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have anyone in it who is pregnant,\u0026rdquo; Emma answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;Do you want to be?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Someday,\u0026rdquo; Emma said.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you want to get pregnant?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked Cleo.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, very much,\u0026rdquo; Cleo answered, stroking Rikki\u0026rsquo;s hair.\n\u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo; Ann continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Because we will know when it is time,\u0026rdquo; Rikki answered. \u0026ldquo;We agreed that we would all go together, and Emma and I are not ready. Cleo has agreed to wait.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What was it like, becoming a mermaid?\u0026rdquo; asked Kate.\n\u0026ldquo;It was wonderful, almost magical,\u0026rdquo; Cleo sighed. \u0026ldquo;I remember that it felt like my whole body had become light or energy, and that I had this incredible power in my body.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It was also sexy as hell,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said. \u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry \u0026hellip; you guys haven\u0026rsquo;t, um?\u0026rdquo; She said shifting her gaze from Trevor to the girls.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Ann giggled. \u0026ldquo;My father would kill us if we had sex before we got married. And Trevor is just a good friend.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s cute though,\u0026rdquo; Emma observed. \u0026ldquo;He would make a good pod-mate.\u0026rdquo;\nMuSu cleared his throat, not turning back to face the mermaids as he looked out on the lagoon.\n\u0026ldquo;Not as good as MuSu, of course,\u0026rdquo; Emma said quickly.\n\u0026ldquo;No, MuSu is the best of all the mermen,\u0026rdquo; Cleo added.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s alright,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said, and then giggled when he glared at her.\n\u0026ldquo;So did MuSu teach you to speak Chinese?\u0026rdquo; Robbie asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Rikki answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but how?\u0026rdquo; Robbie persisted.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Rikki answered. \u0026ldquo;We just started talking, and he would correct us, and we slowly got better and better. Just like he learned English.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You just started talking?\u0026rdquo; Robbie asked, incredulous.\n\u0026ldquo;Cleo?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked. \u0026ldquo;What is the middle organ on an electric eel called?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not a biologist,\u0026rdquo; Cleo complained, playing with Rikki\u0026rsquo;s hair. \u0026ldquo;How should I know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Humor me,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;Something Robbie just said. So tell me, just think, what is the name of an electric eel\u0026rsquo;s middle electric organ?\u0026rdquo;\nCleo shot Emma an exasperated looked and then closed her eyes to think. \u0026ldquo;Hunter\u0026rsquo;s Organ,\u0026rdquo; she said guessing.\n\u0026ldquo;I knew it! You\u0026rsquo;re a genius,\u0026rdquo; Emma said, offering Robbie a high five.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; asked Cleo? \u0026ldquo;What just happened?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You knew,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t tell you, but I only learned it yesterday, and you knew it too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the big deal about that?\u0026rdquo; Cleo asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, I know some stuff too,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said. \u0026ldquo;You still don\u0026rsquo;t know what our third organ does, do you?\u0026rdquo; Emma shook her head.\n\u0026ldquo;Pat must have told us those names,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said. \u0026ldquo;We just don\u0026rsquo;t remember it from the meeting a few days ago.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Emma said, growing more excited. \u0026ldquo;She didn\u0026rsquo;t say any names because she said that we need to come up with new names: mer names. She only said that we have eight new organs that don\u0026rsquo;t exist in human anatomy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, how did Cleo know the name of that organ?\u0026rdquo; Rikki asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s because we are connected, we are a pod,\u0026rdquo; Emma answered. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s why we learn languages so fast, and why we know how each of us are feeling, and all that. We learn via our connections.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, we could learn everything someone else knew if we were pod-mates with them?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I think so,\u0026rdquo; Emma answered. \u0026ldquo;But we all learn a little bit from other pods, not just our mates, though those learning links are not as strong as our own. We\u0026rsquo;ve just never discovered that the pod learning may be unconscious.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Unconscious?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Cleo knew the name of the organ without being actually told, and she doesn\u0026rsquo;t care much for science,\u0026rdquo; Robbie concluded. \u0026ldquo;But you actually like science, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, Phoebe and I are the only young mermaids who really like science, and we are always learning new stuff from Pat, Galina, and Alexis. But everyone, even Cleo, knows a lot about marine biology, what stuff to eat, and stuff like that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know stuff about Russian literature,\u0026rdquo; Cleo sniffed. \u0026ldquo;I actually like talking to Galina about that stuff.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is pretty international here,\u0026rdquo; Emma agreed. \u0026ldquo;We all have learned stuff about America, China, Thailand, the Philippines, Russia, all kinds of places.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you teach everyone about Australia,\u0026rdquo; MuSu offered.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;We wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to go to college! We could stay!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, you might,\u0026rdquo; Emma agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;If you can get your father to agree,\u0026rdquo; Trevor cautioned.\n\u0026ldquo;Emma, can I ask you a question?\u0026rdquo; Robbie asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Uh, not here, can we go for a walk or a swim?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\nShe looked at MuSu, who nodded his assent.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure, let\u0026rsquo;s go for a swim,\u0026rdquo; she suggested, as the two of them headed for the water.\n\u0026ldquo;I wonder what that is all about?\u0026rdquo; Rikki asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, he gets mysterious every now and again,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s usually nothing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it,\u0026rdquo; Kate agreed. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just his artistic side showing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Goodbye,\u0026rdquo; Pat shouted out to the boat as it pushed its way out into the open sea. Her head and shoulders bobbed in the warm lagoon as she waved vigorously. \u0026ldquo;We will take good care of Robbie and Trevor!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;d better,\u0026rdquo; Janice called back.\nPat watched the boat for another few minutes, savoring the water as it supported her body, her fins gently twirling in the water to keep her in place. Danni and Phoebe were on her flanks, and John was below, brushing among all three of their tails. Liga, Petra, and Xing also bobbed in the water nearby. Liga was feeling \u0026ldquo;very pregnant,\u0026rdquo; as she explained to anyone who would listen. Xing was just as pregnant, the two of them having conceived on the same day, but she seemed much more comfortable than Liga. Petra was trying to keep Michelle entertained as the little mermaid swam and splashed all around her mother. All the rest of the mers were leaping and playing alongside the sailboat, as it made its way out into the sea.\nPat smiled to herself as she saw Kate and Ann finally laugh at MuSu, who had been putting on an extraordinary display with his own pod-mates. She knew Kate and Ann were deeply disappointed that Hank had insisted that they leave, but she also knew, though they did not, that they would be back much sooner than the girls expected.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go back and see if the new sled works,\u0026rdquo; Pat suggested. \u0026ldquo;I know that Trevor and Robbie want to join us as mers as quickly as possible, and so we need to get that gun working.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But who would become the girl?\u0026rdquo; Liga asked. \u0026ldquo;We are all full, and we don\u0026rsquo;t want to make room like we did for Eric and Sally.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;Either they will work that one out themselves, or some others will show up in the mean time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hopefully not the US Navy,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, scooping her daughter up into her arms, kissing her on her forehead.\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of which, let\u0026rsquo;s get back and work on that sled,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\nAll the mermaids nodded and they all flipped back beneath the waves, John assuming the lead as they swam in an extended mer-diamond formation. As Pat settled into her position behind John\u0026rsquo;s right pelvic fin, she sensed Petra and Michelle fall in behind her own pelvic fin, while Xing got behind Danni who was on John\u0026rsquo;s other flank. Phoebe and Liga took the bottom diamond spots behind Danni and Pat, and they all fell into a shared rhythm that sped them back towards the caves.\nIt felt good to be swimming, Pat decided, watching the sleek forms slicing through the water around her. Her belly was beginning to show, now that she was nearly ten months pregnant, but swimming helped her cope with the feelings of fullness and pressure from within. Poor little Liga was only one day less pregnant than she was, but her belly was showing almost as much as Petra\u0026rsquo;s had in her eleventh month. Pat closed her eyes and reached out with her mer-senses. Liga was fine, if a bit tired, nothing to worry about.\nManalo stood before his father, his eyes fixed confidently on Malaki\u0026rsquo;s face. Few men stood before the diminutive crime boss with such confidence, but Manalo was Malaki\u0026rsquo;s son. Behind him, he could hear Miss Chin nervously assembling papers.\n\u0026ldquo;We have put our agents in Fiji on the track,\u0026rdquo; Manalo reported. \u0026ldquo;We should hear back in a month or two.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is not soon enough,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said, twirling a ring on his finger, the only outward sign of his impatience.\n\u0026ldquo;I will fly to Suva to see if special attention can speed things up,\u0026rdquo; Manalo offered.\n\u0026ldquo;Acceptable,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said, forming a plan in his head. \u0026ldquo;Take Miss Chin with you as your personal assistant. She may be useful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir,\u0026rdquo; Manalo said, not wanting to smile. She would be most useful indeed. She knew nearly every aspect of his father\u0026rsquo;s empire, and she could fill in a few holes in his own knowledge. His father didn\u0026rsquo;t keep things from him on purpose, he knew, but knowledge was power. Power was protection, and only a fool would completely trust his father. He was determined to show him that his father had not raised a fool.\n\u0026ldquo;Make regular reports,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said, dismissing them as he turned in his chair to face the large window that looked out over the city.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir,\u0026rdquo; Manalo said with a smile at Miss Chin. \u0026ldquo;Come with me,\u0026rdquo; he ordered, smiling broadly as he strode from the office. Miss Chin would also be useful because Manalo had been waiting for nearly two years to seduce the pretty, young secretary. He had been the one to kidnap her sister, Lin, and forced her into prostitution. Lin was a very responsive lover, even in her drugged state. Now, he would have the younger sister too, and then move her into the brothel with her sister after this mission was over. His father would approve.\nThree weeks later, the boys were washing off the grime and dirt of the jungle, finally finished with their task of helping to set up the gun.\n\u0026ldquo;When did they say the test firing would go off?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Noon,\u0026rdquo; Robbie answered, relaxing in the lagoon\u0026rsquo;s warm water.\n\u0026ldquo;Then we should get up to the hot tub,\u0026rdquo; Trevor suggested, rising from the water and walking towards the beach.\nUsing the sled harvested from Tumibay and the new one they had assembled themselves, the mers had successfully freed the 130 mm forward gun from the Russian submarine. According to the materials harvested from the captain\u0026rsquo;s quarters, the gun was experimental, designed to be detached from the sub and put on a remote beachhead, fully automated, and remotely operated. It used solar power to store energy for its servos and hydraulic systems. It was perfect for the mers, but it was heavy. However, by using the ancient technologies of fulcrums, logs, and ropes, the mers and the boys were able to lift it above the rocky coves on the eastern edge of the island.\nOnce they deployed the gun\u0026rsquo;s self-stabilizing mechanical arms, Trevor and Robbie ran cables from one of the listening holes near the western caves over to the gun\u0026rsquo;s location. Closer listening holes on the eastern edge of the island had proved impossible to thread through the rock itself. They also strung cables up from the Moon Pool Chimney to a rock outcropping near the summit of the volcano and mounted the targeting platform. Alexis explained that it too was an experimental design, very small, but very powerful. It could look over the horizon, further than the gun\u0026rsquo;s range of 30 kilometers (18 miles). Best of all, it used solar power arrays, which also helped power the gun\u0026rsquo;s control systems, ones that demanded more power than the fuel cells could give. The boys were also the primary laborers in the effort to camouflage both the gun and the radar unit.\nNow finished and hopefully operational, MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod towed Eric and Sally\u0026rsquo;s ancient fishing boat out to sea, where it was now drifting about 10 kilometers south of the island. If all went well, it would be at the bottom of the sea within the hour.\nRobbie rose from the water and headed for the beach. He and Trevor had worked hard, and both their bodies were bronzed by the sun and hardened by their work. But Robbie had worked three times as hard as Trevor, and he had gained significant weight and muscle in the past few weeks. He glanced at Trevor\u0026rsquo;s back, and judged that he now weighed almost as much as Trevor did, finally. The plan he had formulated several weeks ago was now coming to fruition. Both he and Trevor were anxious to become mers, but up until now, Trevor had a discernable advantage in height and weight. The gap was much closer now, and Robbie felt confident he could overpower Trevor when it came time. He followed Trevor into the jungle, and up to the mountainside hot tub where they had been asked to observe the test firing of the new gun.\n\u0026ldquo;That is the boat,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, pointing at a small blip of boat-shaped light on the computer screen. \u0026ldquo;This new pulse technology works much better than the old radar.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You can almost see the shape of that boat,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel remarked, impressed.\n\u0026ldquo;It was Yuri who designed the technology,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, remembering an old colleague.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, I remember him,\u0026rdquo; Galina said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s too bad he died. He would have loved to be a merman. He was navy from when he was ten years old.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is everyone set?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked Emma, who was floating in the small pool that marked the entrance to the lab cave.\nEmma ducked below the water and sent out a vocal pulse that echoed down the tunnel. A few minutes later, Rikki emerged.\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone is set,\u0026rdquo; she reported. \u0026ldquo;Everyone but us is in the Moon Pool, and MuSu and Cleo are in the listening cave. They report that both boys are in the hot tub.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Gabriel, any chance I can talk you out of this?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked. \u0026ldquo;What if the flash is registered by the European or Russian EOS systems?\n\u0026ldquo;It would be hard to discern in the sunlight, and we aren\u0026rsquo;t going to rely on the gun,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel argued. \u0026ldquo;But we need to know that it works if we are to have any position to negotiate with aggressors. Remember, the most useful weapon is one that is never used.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I just had to try—\u0026rdquo; Pat began.\n\u0026ldquo;We know,\u0026rdquo; John said, bringing her into an embrace. \u0026ldquo;But it will change what we can do if we are threatened. I would rather swim into a torpedo tube myself, if I thought I could protect you and our children. Hopefully, we will never have to use it.\u0026rdquo;\nPat nodded, and closed her eyes. Gabriel turned to Galina and nodded. Galina\u0026rsquo;s fingers typed a few quick commands into her computer, and seconds later they heard a distant thump. A few seconds more, and the blip on their computer screen disappeared.\nTrevor hadn\u0026rsquo;t meant to violate anyone\u0026rsquo;s privacy, but he could not turn away from the sight below him. After the successful test-firing, he volunteered to check the gun for any damage or changes to the camouflage caused by the firing, but really it was a change to be alone, to think. He wanted to be away from everyone, but most especially Robbie. They had argued while they waited in the hot tub for the gun to fire. If it worked, Robbie reminded him, they could become mers. But, because all the pods were \u0026ldquo;full,\u0026rdquo; one of them would have to become a mermaid. Neither would volunteer to become the girl, and Robbie had suggested a wrestling match to decide who would become the mermaid.\nTrevor could not agree to the contest. After all, what if he lost? Even though he knew that he was taller and heavier than Robbie, he didn\u0026rsquo;t think it would be an easy win. Robbie was strong, quick, and agile, and he had been working like a madman for the past three weeks. Trevor was smart enough to see that Robbie had been planning this challenge the entire time. Despite his fears, he could think of little else than the prospect of becoming a mer, even a mermaid.\nThe sight he saw below was now amplifying his internal struggles. MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod was frolicking on the beach, the three identical girls laughing and giggling as they rolled and played in the surf with MuSu. One of the girls, it was impossible to tell them apart if you weren\u0026rsquo;t a mer, pinned MuSu\u0026rsquo;s arms to the sand while she ground her body along his, their tails erotically entwined. One of the other two girls pinned the other girl to the sand in a similar manner, rubbing their bodies together, and kissing. Trevor watched transfixed as the mers began to make love in the shallow water.\nThe mermaid over MuSu lifted her head to the sky and moaned loudly as she impaled herself on MuSu\u0026rsquo;s cock. MuSu grabbed her shapely hips just below her pelvic fins, and began lifting her up and down, their flukes splashing in the water. Trevor could see her breasts jostle with each thrust of her body down onto MuSu, her arms rested on his chest, as she held herself erect. He could see the other two girls lying next to each other, their hands buried in each other\u0026rsquo;s vents as they kissed and nipped one another\u0026rsquo;s faces, shoulders, and breasts.\nTrevor suddenly discovered that his hard cock was in his hand, and that his shorts were around his ankles. As he stroked his cock, he wondered what it would be like to be a mermaid. Everyone on the beach seemed to be having an equal amount of fun. Suddenly, the mermaid over MuSu cried out, and milk began to spurt from her breasts, her entire body quaking with the force of her orgasm. MuSu roared out as he too erupted in an equally impressive orgasm, pulling the mermaid\u0026rsquo;s hips to his, keeping his cock buried deep within her as she shivered and quaked above him. Their tails flashed with luminescent strands of blue, yellow, and white as their orgasms rolled through their bodies. Trevor felt his own orgasm rise quickly, and he stifled a moan as he shot his semen onto the rocks behind which he was hiding.\nAs he recovered his wits, he reassessed Robbie\u0026rsquo;s proposal. Both of them wanted to become mers, and neither wanted to wait. The thought of changing was intoxicating, and it filled nearly every daydream and fantasy he had. One of those three mermaids was Emma, and she used to be a boy. In fact, as he thought about it, ten of the sixteen current mers (not counting little Michelle) had been born the opposite sex they currently enjoyed. None of the changed mers seemed to be complaining.\nHis own penis was still pulsing in his hand, and he shook it off, and stuffed it back into his pants. He realized that the risk of becoming the mermaid wasn\u0026rsquo;t as scary as he originally thought when Robbie first approached him. In fact, it was exciting. Oh, he was confident that he could pin his old friend, and if Robbie was willing to risk becoming a girl, he could risk it too.\nIt would be fun.\nMac Bennett looked again at the reports on his desk. One detailed how Sally and Eric had flown to Fiji, bought a boat, and were somewhere in the South Pacific. The other was a routine report that all upper level officers received that showed changes in classifications to the world\u0026rsquo;s oceans. Quite by accident, the admiral himself had noticed that a new classified location had been declared a few hundred miles northwest of Fiji. When he probed further, he discovered that the Blackgate protocol had been used; a procedure that rendered a twenty nautical mile arc of the South Pacific classified and wiped out all files on the various islands and atolls within that area.\nAs much as he didn\u0026rsquo;t want to believe his own eyes, he could not ignore the coincidence. Did Sally herself initiate the Blackgate, or did someone else? If she did, why did she? The boat they bought might make it to the classified area, but it would not make it back. How much attention did he want to bring to himself and his daughter? The Blackgate protocol was difficult to trace, but it was possible. It only depended on how much trouble you wanted to stir up.\nHe stood and walked to the window that overlooked the Potomac. He crossed his arms and sighed. She and Eric were there; he knew that with a sad certainty. But why? Why would his daughter or someone else designate a small section of the South Pacific as a Blackgate area before she went there? If it had been a legitimate terrorist threat, he felt sure she would not betray her country or her father. He felt even more confident that if Sally knew about the Blackgate or did it herself, she would not go off with that surfer to save the world from a dangerous threat.\nEven if this wasn\u0026rsquo;t a traitorous act, this was still more than an impulsive trip with a handsome young surfer. Something was going on, something that Sally or someone else didn\u0026rsquo;t want him to know. He was sure of that, at least. Sally\u0026rsquo;s disappearance and the new Blackgate were linked, and he was the target. It might not be dangerous, but it might be embarrassing for him and his career to have a daughter, his only daughter, jeopardize national security for some romantic whim just to get away from his overbearing control and influence.\nOn the other hand, the Blackgate protocol was rarely invoked, and the paperwork would eventually surface that explained why it had been used. He had the security clearances needed to see the report. There was still a chance that it was something else, possibly treason or terrorism, and that his daughter was involved. But whom could he trust? How could he continue this investigation before alerting other prying eyes?\nHe returned to his desk, and picked up the phone.\n\u0026ldquo;Dawkins, get me Joy Simpson on the phone,\u0026rdquo; he said.\nJoy Simpson had retired from the CIA two years ago, and she had been a friend since his wife died. In fact, his wife had introduced them, but after her death, their careers had prevented them from becoming something other than friends. Joy had been close to Sally as well, though not enough to help with her hellion stage as young teen. Most importantly, however, was that Joy was based in Hong Kong, and still lived there after her retirement.\nHis phone buzzed. \u0026ldquo;Ms. Simpson on the line, sir.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got it,\u0026rdquo; he answered gruffly. \u0026ldquo;This is Mackenzie Bennett.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, Mac,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;To what do I owe this great surprise?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You want to do what?\u0026rdquo; John asked. \u0026ldquo;You mother will kill me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We both want to be mers, and we don\u0026rsquo;t want to wait,\u0026rdquo; Robbie explained. \u0026ldquo;But neither one of us wants to be a girl. This way it will be fair.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you have agreed to this foolishness?\u0026rdquo; John asked Trevor, who nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;And you do realize that size and strength are major factors in determining who gets changed?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked. \u0026ldquo;You are slightly smaller than Trevor, you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said nervously, \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m faster and smarter.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know about smarter,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;Your parents will be back in a few months, maybe sooner. Why can\u0026rsquo;t you just wait until then? We have actually planned for your transition, you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m tired of everyone planning things for me, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to wait. Now that the gun is done, there is nothing to do. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to just sit around, waiting for two or three months.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Me neither,\u0026rdquo; Trevor added. \u0026ldquo;Besides, the risk is exciting.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s so risky about being a mermaid?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked with a warning glance. \u0026ldquo;There is nothing bad about it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly! That is more or less what Robbie and I said this morning,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said, backpedaling. \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s a bad thing, but neither one of us wants to \u0026ldquo;choose\u0026rdquo; to become the mermaid. We would rather let fate or luck do that work for us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, one of you will become a girl,\u0026rdquo; Pat warned. \u0026ldquo;Now that our mermaid milk is more powerful, the change will be quick, perhaps in only a few minutes once you start down this path. One slip could mean the difference between male or female.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you are telling me that being a female is a bad thing?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I\u0026rsquo;m not,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;I just want to make sure both of you have thought this through. Robbie\u0026rsquo;s parents are recruiting a pod for each of you, or at least that was the plan.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said. \u0026ldquo;I would rather be with Trevor, who has been a good friend for many years, than with some of the Greenpeace activists I suspect that they are recruiting.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, can we do it?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, it is possible,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;Even if it isn\u0026rsquo;t advisable. If you had a few feedings and then went off to fight it out, one of you would begin to change into a woman. You could come back to the Moon Pool and finish the transition into mers, or you could wait until the change to a woman was complete, and then change to mers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You probably don\u0026rsquo;t want to wait too long after determining who is the girl before changing to mers,\u0026rdquo; Galina warned. \u0026ldquo;We know that organisms continue to develop in the absence of the electromagnetic fields we generate in the Moon Pool. If you wait too long, you might start changing into something else entirely.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How long would be dangerous?\u0026rdquo; Robbie asked.\n\u0026ldquo;With just normal mermaid milk, about thirty-six hours,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered.\n\u0026ldquo;There is something else?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s on a need to know basis,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered tersely.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, no problem,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to know yet. I think that we want to spend the night sorting things out, and we will change to mers the next day,\u0026rdquo; Robbie suggested, and Trevor nodded.\nManalo looked out on the beach, watching Shen Chin walk back from the ocean. She was stunning in her bikini, her perfectly proportioned figure swaying back and forth as she trailed her towel behind her. He lounged on the bed of the exclusive beachside hotel, and marveled at the last few weeks. Shen nearly raped him when they first arrived at the hotel. He thought he would be raping her, but she practically ripped her own clothes off and then went after his the moment the door closed.\nThe sex was fantastic, even better than her older sister. Shen was also a more vocal lover, and Manalo had been rung dry by her apparently insatiable appetite. As she walked into the room, she gave him a smile that curled his toes and stiffened his penis.\n\u0026ldquo;I see you are finally awake,\u0026rdquo; she purred as she untied the knot behind her neck. She pulled the top free and pushed her small breasts together. \u0026ldquo;You ready for breakfast?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Manalo said, still not believing his luck. \u0026ldquo;But we have to get to the consulate by ten this morning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s only eight,\u0026rdquo; she said, pushing down her bottoms, revealing the small arrow of hair above a pair of slightly swollen lips. \u0026ldquo;We have plenty of time,\u0026rdquo; she said as she crawled seductively onto the bed.\n\u0026ldquo;My father has no idea what he is missing,\u0026rdquo; he said as she grabbed his stiff cock and pointed it at her vagina.\n\u0026ldquo;Neither do you,\u0026rdquo; thought Shen Chin to herself as she impaled herself on the easily manipulated young man. She was almost ready to put her plan into action.\n\u0026ldquo;Now remember, our milk is more potent than it used to be, so be ready,\u0026rdquo; Galina advised as she handed Trevor two canteens. \u0026ldquo;This one is mermaid milk, and this one is a mix of mermaid milk and merman semen. Once one of you starts to change, the other one should finish the rest of the milk while the one who is changing should drink the mix.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;According to Pat\u0026rsquo;s calculations, the first change should be noticeable in only a few minutes,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, holding Michelle to her breast, which had only moments ago fed Robbie. \u0026ldquo;Once you drink the mixed canteen, the change into a full fledged woman should only take less than an hour. You can even speed that up to only a few minutes by—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Robbie interrupted. \u0026ldquo;We know how to speed the change along.\u0026rdquo; Both he and Trevor blushed.\n\u0026ldquo;Good luck, and we\u0026rsquo;ll see you tomorrow morning,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said.\nRobbie and Trevor watched Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s pod return to the water. The boys had their first feedings from Pat and Danni that morning, and they could both feel the milk coursing through their bodies, and so they avoided one another and stayed with a mermaid to keep their maleness potent. A second feeding at mid-day with MuSu\u0026rsquo;s girls had raised the power of the milk, and they both felt power throbbing within them. The third feeding at dinner with Petra and Galina had lifted that power to a fever pitch. John had warned them about the aggression they might feel, but neither boy felt overly aggressive or angry. They both felt nervous, and excited.\n\u0026ldquo;Ready?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Best two out of three?\u0026rdquo; Robbie joked.\n\u0026ldquo;Once we start, there\u0026rsquo;s no going back,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said. \u0026ldquo;The first change is not reversible.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Except in the case of a pod losing its male,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said.\n\u0026ldquo;And neither one of us want that,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said.\n\u0026ldquo;You nervous?\u0026rdquo; Robbie asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said. \u0026ldquo;You ready to be more than just friends?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s do it.\u0026rdquo;\nThey both walked up the beach onto a clear area of sand and stripped out of their swimsuits. Naked, they faced each other, both of their cocks at half-mast, the sexual tension throbbing even as they both faced the possibility that one of them would lose that cock shortly. They circled around one another, pacing in the sand. Robbie suddenly charged, and Trevor dodged him easily. They resumed circling, feeling the power of the milk course through their bodies.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll make a very tall woman,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said, \u0026ldquo;like my sisters.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have to pin me first,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said, circling like a tiger. \u0026ldquo;What will your new female name be?\u0026rdquo;\nRobbie ran at him again, catching him in the chest, and they both tumbled to the sand. Robbie pressed his arm into Trevor\u0026rsquo;s throat, trying to pin him down while he pushed his torso on top of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s. He could feel Trevor\u0026rsquo;s erection pressing into his own, and he looked into Trevor\u0026rsquo;s eyes and saw the panic in his face.\n\u0026ldquo;What will yours be?\u0026rdquo; Robbie asked.\nSuddenly, Trevor heaved his entire body into the air, and threw Robbie off of him. Robbie rolled away as Trevor scrambled to catch him, but he sprang clear of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s reach. The two men resumed circling one another.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re gonna have to hold me down longer than that,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said as he charged again.\nTrevor didn\u0026rsquo;t dodge this time, and instead stuck out a foot. Robbie went down with a thud into the sand, face first. Trevor landed on him with a thump. Robbie clawed at the sand, trying to get out from under Trevor, but the larger man had him pinned. Robbie continued to struggle, twisting and clawing at the sand. Trevor stayed on top of him, their sweaty bodies grinding into the sand. He grabbed one of Robbie\u0026rsquo;s ankles and brought it up to his chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Noooooo!\u0026rdquo; Robbie screamed, as he suddenly felt the energy in his body change.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry, buddy,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said softly, even as he felt his own body respond to the change in power between the two of them. \u0026ldquo;You get to be the mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\nRobbie continued to struggle, even as he felt the effects of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s weight on his back seep into his body. He could feel his energy draining, the milk beginning to do its work on his body. With each passing second, his efforts to escape grew less and less, until finally he stopped moving. He panted into the sand, feeling Trevor\u0026rsquo;s powerful weight pressing into his back, his knee throbbing where Trevor had stretched it back.\n\u0026ldquo;Let me up,\u0026rdquo; Robbie gasped. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s over. You won.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said as he lifted himself up, noticing that he had changed a little bit already. His chest was broader and deeper, and his cock was larger. It now bounced before him, arching at least eight inches into the air.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said as he turned over, brushing sand from his body. \u0026ldquo;We both took the same chance.\u0026rdquo;\nHe looked down at himself, and both men could see the changes already working on both their bodies. Robbie\u0026rsquo;s hair was already longer, and there was the slightest flair to his hips.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get this over with as soon as possible,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said, reaching for the canteens. \u0026ldquo;Which one is mine?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The one on the left,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said, watching Robbie with fascination as the younger man seemed to be handling his loss with a lot of class.\nRobbie handed the other canteen to Trevor and opened the top on his. He sniffed the contents. \u0026ldquo;Oh, yea,\u0026rdquo; he muttered making a face, \u0026ldquo;this one is mine.\u0026rdquo;\nTrevor opened his canteen and smelled the same sweetness he had enjoyed from his previous feedings. \u0026ldquo;Well, cheers,\u0026rdquo; he said nervously.\n\u0026ldquo;Bottoms up,\u0026rdquo; Robbie said, holding Trevor\u0026rsquo;s gaze as he downed the contents of the canteen.\nRobbie could feel the warm mix of milk and semen as it cascaded down his throat, creating a pleasant burning in his belly. It didn\u0026rsquo;t taste as bad as it smelled, he decided. As he held Trevor\u0026rsquo;s gaze in his own, he knew that he was putting up a good front, but secretly Robbie was excited by the prospect of changing into a woman. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t have volunteered to do so, but the fight had been a fair one, and he might have won it. Now, the cards had been played, and Robbie was going to play the game for all it was worth.\nRobbie set the empty canteen on the sand, and watched as Trevor finished his. Robbie examined the young man in a way he had never allowed himself to do before. Trevor\u0026rsquo;s blonde hair and blue eyes were actually quite attractive, and he now understood why his sisters had gone on and on over how cute Trevor was. His shoulders had broadened, thanks to the siren cells that were making his own shrink, and his hips had narrowed, even as Robbie\u0026rsquo;s own had widened. When Trevor finished his canteen, he gave Robbie a sheepish smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Now what, Robbie?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;First of all, it will be Rose,\u0026rdquo; Robbie stated. \u0026ldquo;Second of all, let\u0026rsquo;s get into the water. My bones already ache, and Emma said it would help.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When did Emma tell you that?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked, extending his hand down to Robbie/Rose to help him get up.\n\u0026ldquo;Before my parents left,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;I asked her what the change was like.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What did she say?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked as he headed for the water.\n\u0026ldquo;She only wished that she had been a girl for longer than a few minutes,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, easing herself into the warm water, pushing her hair from her face. \u0026ldquo;This water feels wonderful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So that\u0026rsquo;s why you suggested that we spend the night,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said gaining understanding. \u0026ldquo;You want to spend the night as a girl before you become a mermaid. Why you little minx!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not yet,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;But if you come over here and kiss me, you can make me your little minx a lot more quickly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You sure you\u0026rsquo;re ready for this?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked as he wadded over to where Rose was floating in the water, and sat down in on the sandy bottom.\nThe water was shallow, less than a meter, and Rose floated into Trevor\u0026rsquo;s lap, resting her slowly but visibly changing head on his lap. \u0026ldquo;Will you please kiss me?\u0026rdquo; she asked. \u0026ldquo;I can feel the changes, but they are slow.\u0026rdquo;\nTrevor looked down at Rose\u0026rsquo;s body and saw that her hips and waist were slightly female, and that Robbie\u0026rsquo;s cock had shrunk, but was still hard and pointing into the air. He looked down into Robbie\u0026rsquo;s dark brown eyes, and smiled. Rose was already visible in his face, and his features softer and smaller. Trevor leaned down and kissed him.\nRose, as she repeated to herself inside her head, pulled Trevor into the kiss, feeling his/her mouth press into his as she thrust her tongue into his mouth. If she was going to become a mermaid, she was going to be the prettiest and sexiest one possible. She could feel the power of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s presence loom over her, his body cradling her as she changed. Her hips and shoulders ached as they stretched or shrank, but she focused her efforts on becoming Trevor\u0026rsquo;s perfect woman. They kissed for several minutes, holding and caressing one another as both continued to change.\n\u0026ldquo;Rest time,\u0026rdquo; Rose breathed, trying to catch her breath. Between the power of the milk and the power of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s kisses, her head was spinning. She closed her eyes and catalogued what was happening to her. Her body ached everywhere, and she could tell she was losing mass. Her hair was growing at an astounding rate, and her insides felt like jelly. After a few minutes of trying to catch her breath, she reached back up and pulled Trevor into another kiss.\nTrevor felt Rose meld her changing lips over his and her tongue swirled around his lips and teeth, dueling with his own tongue. Her hands gripped his head, and he put his arms around her, pulling her torso to his. He could feel two small bumps on her shrinking chest, and the slope of her waist away from her ribs. He ran his hands down her back, feeling the dimples above the soft swell of her expanding ass. His own erection throbbed almost painfully, and it brushed her sides as she twisted in his embrace.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, those were some kisses,\u0026rdquo; she breathed, feeling the passion and power of the mermaid fluids flow through her body.\n\u0026ldquo;Your eyes have changed,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said, holding her face in his hands, her quickly growing hair floating in the water around her like a halo.\n\u0026ldquo;How?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;They were brown, but now they are the most beautiful violet eyes that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said. \u0026ldquo;And your hair is darker, almost black. You look like a young Elizabeth Taylor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really? Is that your dream girl?\u0026rdquo; Rose asked.\n\u0026ldquo;She was,\u0026rdquo; Trevor answered. \u0026ldquo;You remember that I have always liked those old movies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Rose said smiling, her face lighting up in a way never before possible. \u0026ldquo;My art movies and your old movies, and my sisters never like either one of them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about me?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked. \u0026ldquo;Am I changing?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not much,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, looking. \u0026ldquo;Still blond, blue-eyed, and gorgeous, though I never really noticed that last one before today. Your shoulders are wider, and your muscles are more defined. You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be focusing on changing me. God, kiss me again!\u0026rdquo;\nThey kissed feverishly, mashing their mouths together, each trying to taste the other. Trevor focused his energies on her for the first time, willing her to become the girl of his dreams. After a few minutes of kissing, Rose pulled back and groaned.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; big push,\u0026rdquo; she gasped as her hips widened yet again. She put a hand to her abdomen and grunted. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s all mush in there, all pushing and pulling and twisting. I can feel everything changing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you alright?\u0026rdquo; asked Trevor. \u0026ldquo;Is there anything I can do?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; she whispered, feeling the power of the milk pulse in her belly. Then she remembered Petra\u0026rsquo;s advice from earlier. \u0026ldquo;Yes, wait, there is something you can do. Move further towards the beach.\u0026rdquo;\nStill holding her in his arms, Trevor used his legs to push them further towards shallow water. When he reached the point where his butt hit the sand and his cock extended from the water, she stopped him.\n\u0026ldquo;Lie back,\u0026rdquo; she said, keeping her hips in slightly deeper water, floating next to his legs. \u0026ldquo;Focus on what you want me to become,\u0026rdquo; she said, as she put her face even with Trevor\u0026rsquo;s expanded cock and reached for it with her left hand.\nAs she touched it, she felt a spark of electricity flow between them. She wondered if it was from his brain or his body, but it flowed through her body, sending tendrils of pleasure up and down her limbs. She focused on the penis she now held in her hand, the first one other than her own that she had ever grasped. It felt hard and soft at the same time, much bigger than her own had once been. She stroked it a few times, feeling Trevor\u0026rsquo;s abdomen tense.\n\u0026ldquo;Petra did say it would speed things up,\u0026rdquo; Rose said.\n\u0026ldquo;Things are pretty speedy if you ask me,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you saying that you don\u0026rsquo;t want me to suck on your cock?\u0026rdquo; she asked coyly.\n\u0026ldquo;No man in the world would ever deny such a pretty lady the opportunity to suck on his dick,\u0026rdquo; he said with eager anticipation.\n\u0026ldquo;Just checking,\u0026rdquo; she said, and slipped the crown into her mouth.\nIt felt warm, warmer than she expected, and it tasted slightly of salt water. It was a clean taste, however, and she decided she liked it. She began to bob her head up and down, stroking the length with her hand, feeling her wet hair, still growing, hanging down around her. She pushed her hair away from her face and resumed stroking his cock, feeling the blood pound within its shaft. She could feel her body changing, responding to Trevor\u0026rsquo;s touch, his smell, and his presence. Now that her bones were nearly done, she ached less and felt more pleasure. A twinge of stronger pleasure signaled that her growing vagina was nearly done. She could also feel the beginnings of her breasts hanging from her chest, bobbing with the motions of her head. She focused all her energies on becoming that a girl, a complete woman, Trevor\u0026rsquo;s mate.\nTrevor looked down at the beautiful creature that was giving him the blowjob of his life. Her hair hung down over her shoulders, and the small cones of her new breasts jutted from her small and slender rib cage. Her left hip rose from the water near his knees; her waist below the surface of the water. There was very little of Robbie left, only Rose, and only in a matter of minutes. He could feel her legs wrap around his, her shorter and smaller feet caressing his. He could feel his orgasm rise up quickly, and he groaned as he spurted into her mouth.\nRose felt his cock swell in her hand and pressed her lips around his cock, eager for proof of her power over him. She savored the salty musky semen as it pulsed in her mouth. After Trevor finished, she kept him in her mouth, sucking softly as his cock deflated slightly. She could feel her breasts finally, becoming heavy and full, pressing into Trevor\u0026rsquo;s hip as she sucked on his lovely cock. They felt huge, and she could feel her newly enlarged nipples stiffening as she rubbed her chest on his hip.\nShe shifted in the water, swinging her wide hips over his legs, letting her breasts fall on his thighs, as she continued to suck on his cock. She threaded one of her legs through his and pressed her crotch into his knee. Her new vagina ached with need, and she pressed her cleft into his kneecap, rocking her hips back and forth.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you doing now?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked, feeling her hotness pressed against his knee, her new lips slipping and sliding over his skin.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you need a map?\u0026rdquo; she asked with a giggle, releasing his now very hard cock from her lips.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;But I want a look. Sit up.\u0026rdquo;\nRose trapped both of his legs between hers and sat up. She hunched forward, bringing her crotch even with his, pushing her clit against his cock. She straightened up, and let her hands fall to her sides.\n\u0026ldquo;Well?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\nTrevor leaned up onto his elbows, the warm water sluicing around and between their bodies in the shallow water. He gazed at the transformed boy. Rose was a beauty, with a long slender neck, strong shoulders, slender and graceful arms, with two generous breasts sloping away from her ribs. Her waist was slender, and her hips were wide. Her round thighs rested against his hips, and he looked back up into her face. Her violet eyes blazed with passion and her dark hair cascaded wetly around her face and shoulders, reaching her waist. He reached up and lifted a wet strand of hair away from her breast.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re so beautiful,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Like a dream.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You like?\u0026rdquo; she said coyly, as she ran her hands lightly up from her sides, caressing her flat tummy, rising to the bottoms of her new breasts, and then hefted them for the first time. \u0026ldquo;They are so soft,\u0026rdquo; she said as she squeezed and caressed them, \u0026ldquo;and heavy, too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let me see,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said, as he sat up and took one of her breasts in his hands. They were soft, and full, and her nipple was stiff and puffy. He sucked it into his mouth, swirling his tongue around the rubbery promontory. Rose moaned her appreciation, her hips beginning to twitch, pressing her sex on to his.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t wait,\u0026rdquo; she said as she reached down to his cock, and lifted herself over it. She could feel the heat radiate from her own vagina, and when she pushed the crown over her swollen lips, she could feel her juices flowing like a fountain. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so hot,\u0026rdquo; she gasped, feeling pleasure shoot through her body.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes, you are,\u0026rdquo; Trevor agreed, feeling both her need and his own eagerness to satisfy it.\nRose positioned the head within her cleft, and then let her hips fall onto his, pushing the stiff cock into her new vagina with a single stroke, pushing past her hymen without any pain at all. \u0026ldquo;Oh, my god,\u0026rdquo; she gasped, as the feeling of fullness pulsed outward from her womb in waves, making her entire body feel awash in pleasure. Trevor simply held onto her breast, keeping the nipple in his mouth as he felt Rose rock back and forth on his cock.\nRose felt the twin stimulation of Trevor sucking on her breasts and his cock swirling within her vagina and tried to slow herself down. She wanted to savor this first time, but she could not. She found herself pushing harder and harder down onto Trevor\u0026rsquo;s cock, feeling the stiff shaft swing back and forth within her vagina. Her clit pressed down onto his pelvic bone, and she gripped his head and pulled it into her breasts. She could feel her large breasts jostle around his face, her body shaking back and forth as she hurtled herself towards her first female orgasm. She began to whimper in need.\n\u0026ldquo;Good, good, so good,\u0026rdquo; she gasped with each rock of her hips, the flesh along her ass slapping down on to Trevor. Her hands still pressed his face into her breasts, and Trevor dropped his hands to her hips, guiding her wildly gyrating body, forcing her hips down onto his own, feeling his cock head brush on her cervix.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip;. My \u0026hellip;. GOD!\u0026rdquo; Rose shouted as the orgasm that had been rushing towards her crashed through her body. Trevor struggled for breath as his face was buried in cleavage, feeling his own orgasm rise up as Rose\u0026rsquo;s new muscles deep within her clutched at his cock. Her hips still rocked back and forth, each one another pulse of her orgasm, her thighs were now twitching on their own, out of her control. \u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip;. My \u0026hellip;. TREVOR!\u0026rdquo; she screamed as a cascade of waves raced through her body, triggered by the hotness she felt splashing deep within her new womb. She convulsed with each pulse of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s cock, pressing herself onto him. Finally, after several minutes of quivering aftershocks, she settled down, his cock still buried deep within her.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; she whispered into his hair, still pressing his nose into her cleavage.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; he agreed. \u0026ldquo;And the mers say that it gets better after you transition.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No way,\u0026rdquo; she said, trying to catch her breath. \u0026ldquo;There is no way that anything can be better than that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, no way,\u0026rdquo; he agreed.\nA few moments passed as Rose quivered and twitched, feeling her new body pressed against this man, his slowly deflating cock still buried deep within her.\n\u0026ldquo;Happy?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;About the change?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, about being the girl,\u0026rdquo; he said.\nShe felt her body against his, and gave his semi-hard cock a sharp squeeze with her new interior muscles. \u0026ldquo;What do you think?\u0026rdquo; she giggled as he gasped in pleasure.\nWhen Gabriel and his pod returned to the caves, they found the Moon Pool filled with all the mers. Liga was swimming around in the center of the pool, in premature labor. Her tiny body was wracked with spasms every two or three minutes, and Eric was beside himself.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought you said gestation was eleven months?\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;I did,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered, trying to calm their newest merman. \u0026ldquo;But this is only the second mermaid birth. There is much we don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, do something,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s dying.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, she\u0026rsquo;s not,\u0026rdquo; Sally said, stroking her mate. \u0026ldquo;It only looks that way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It feels that way too,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, holding Michelle by her tail, keeping her from swimming towards Liga. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;ll survive. I did.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When did she start labor?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked.\n\u0026ldquo;This afternoon, just after you left for the lagoon,\u0026rdquo; Alexis answered. \u0026ldquo;She is already in hard labor. It should be anytime, if your delivery was normal.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it was normal,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, corralling her daughter. \u0026ldquo;But it was a miracle.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s dilating,\u0026rdquo; Alexis reported, swimming near her sister wife. \u0026ldquo;I can see the tail.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What will be her name?\u0026rdquo; Eric asked. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not the father, but I need to know her name.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You will be the father,\u0026rdquo; Alexis reassured him. \u0026ldquo;And her name will be Mari, which means love.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I had no idea that I would be a father this quickly,\u0026rdquo; Eric complained.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll do fine,\u0026rdquo; Sally told him. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll have plenty of help, and you\u0026rsquo;re not—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In charge,\u0026rdquo; Eric finished. \u0026ldquo;I know, I know. But do you have to embarrass me in front of everyone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;None of us mermen are in charge,\u0026rdquo; John said, laughing. \u0026ldquo;Get used to it.\u0026rdquo;\nThey could now see Mari\u0026rsquo;s flukes and a few centimeters of her tail. It was black and white stripes with black fringes along the trailing edge of her flukes and dorsal ridge. Liga gave another tremendous push, screaming with all her might, and Mari\u0026rsquo;s torso was visible. Her tiny pelvic fins were beating on the water, as though she was eager to be out and about in the world. Liga convulsed again, and Mari slipped out into the water, her tiny arms above her head.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s see what she does,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, as Alexis moved towards the child.\n\u0026ldquo;She is much smaller than Michelle was,\u0026rdquo; Alexis noted, moving towards the mother and baby, \u0026ldquo;and less developed.\u0026rdquo;\nMari did seem less conscious of her surroundings, and although her eyes were open, she looked surprised and lost. Liga reached down and gathered the tiny mermaid into her arms, immediately starting for the surface of the pool. The other mers followed. Liga tried to push herself and her daughter up onto the shelf, but she was too weak. Eric immediately sensed her frustration and swam underneath of her, gathering her into his arms, and lifted all three of them up onto the shelf at the edge of the pool. Because Liga was so small, being on Eric\u0026rsquo;s lap actually allowed her to get her breasts out of the water. Sally and Alexis quickly joined them on either side while the other mers bobbed along the surface expectantly.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on Mari: breathe,\u0026rdquo; Liga urged.\nThe little mermaid lay cuddled in her mother\u0026rsquo;s arms, blinking her eyes. She flipped her tail up, and twitched her fins.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s not breathing,\u0026rdquo; Liga worried.\n\u0026ldquo;Blow on her face,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said.\nLiga lifted her daughter up to her face and blew softly into her daughter\u0026rsquo;s dark black eyes. Mari blinked again, but otherwise did not move.\n\u0026ldquo;Blow sharply, as though to surprise her,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said.\nLiga gave a sharp breath into her face, and Mari opened her mouth in surprise and took her first breath of air. All the mers collectively sighed in relief, and Liga lay back into Eric\u0026rsquo;s embrace, relaxing for the first time in hours. Alexis helped raise Mari to Liga\u0026rsquo;s breasts, and after a moment or two of struggle, Mari took her first mouthfuls of mermaid milk.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s a bit premature, but she\u0026rsquo;ll be fine,\u0026rdquo; Pat declared. \u0026ldquo;Alexis, you can handle things from here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;All set,\u0026rdquo; she said, reaching back behind her to gather the thread and surgical scissors.\n\u0026ldquo;We will get your dinner,\u0026rdquo; Emma volunteered, and jerked her head at her sisters.\n\u0026ldquo;This is why we are always on guard duty,\u0026rdquo; Cleo complained. \u0026ldquo;Emma is forever volunteering us to do these things.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be a grump,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said. \u0026ldquo;You know that you always feel better after you do it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No I don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Cleo complained. \u0026ldquo;I feel better after MuSu has his way with me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then you\u0026rsquo;ll be first tonight if you help your sisters,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said with a grin.\n\u0026ldquo;All right!\u0026rdquo; Cleo squealed and dived after Emma.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not fair,\u0026rdquo; Rikki complained, even as MuSu disappeared beneath the surface. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s always gets to go first because she\u0026rsquo;s been whining about this or that,\u0026rdquo; she told the remaining mers before diving to follow her pod-mates.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait until they have kids of their own,\u0026rdquo; Pat said smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;God help us all,\u0026rdquo; Danni agreed.\nRose stood before the mirror in the old mountainside huts, looking at herself in the red-yellow light of the setting sun as it slanted across her body. Her formerly dark brown hair was now a lustrous black, thick wavy hair that fell over her shoulders and breasts. Her face was indeed like Elizabeth Taylor\u0026rsquo;s, pixie nose, wide and innocent violet eyes with enormous lashes. Her neck was slender and all traces of Robbie\u0026rsquo;s Adam\u0026rsquo;s apple were gone. She brushed her hair back from her cheeks, feeling how soft her skin was, and she looked at how small and delicate her hand was. Her nails were slightly rounded, like mermaid nails, and she could see the slightest bit of webbing in between her fingers. It is good that they were transitioning fully to mermaids in the morning, she thought to herself. There was still tonight, she reminded herself, and she was taking Emma\u0026rsquo;s advice, enjoying as much time as a girl as she could before she became a mermaid.\nAnd before Trevor became her merman, she thought predatorily, listening to Trevor\u0026rsquo;s efforts at bed making in the other hut. She and Trevor had a long night planned, and that bed was going to play a central role. She had been friends with Trevor for many years, and she knew exactly what kind of woman turned him on. Rose was going to be everything that Trevor had ever fantasized. She turned in the mirror, looking at her body\u0026rsquo;s profile. She was tall for a woman, only losing a few inches in the change from Robbie to Rose. He had been just over six feet tall (182 cm), and now she was about five feet, ten inches tall (177 cm). That was fine, because Trevor was at least six foot four inches (193 cm) tall, and she liked being able to rest her head on his chest when they hugged.\nHer breasts were large, but she had no idea what bra size she might be. His sisters were both B cups, but hers were definitely larger than theirs. She thrilled to the way they swayed and moved as she turned before the mirror. Her breasts hung away from her body nearly as far as her hips flared out from her waist, she thought as she twisted back and forth, comparing the slope of her hips to the slope of her breasts. She spotted a yardstick on the table near the mirror.\nThat gave her an idea, and she rummaged through the hut until she found some string. She laid it on the yardstick and tied a knot at 36 inches. She lifted it up and measured round her ribs, just above her breasts. 36 inches! Then she wrapped the string around her breasts, resting it along the tips of her pleasantly stiff nipples. Pinching the string in her fingers, she measured the length of string past the knot. Five, nearly six, inches. She didn\u0026rsquo;t know what cup size that was, but it seemed impressive. She returned the string to her waist. She smiled, only 21 inches, and she knew that was a small waist. Her hips were 38 inches!\nRose smiled back at the mirror, her full lips wide and beautiful around her white teeth. She ran her hands up from her hips, caressing her flat tummy, and then pressing her breasts together. Yes, she had turned into a sexy woman, and she would be an even sexier mermaid. She left the hut, following the sounds of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s activity, like a lioness on the hunt. She could feel the tightness in her nipples in the cooling air, and her groin felt like it was on fire. She entered the hut and found Trevor straightening up from the bed. She leaned on the doorframe, pressing her ass and shoulders into the frame, leaning her head back so that her hair brushed against her ass. She lifted one leg to rest on her tiptoes, and reached back with one hand to hold onto the doorframe.\n\u0026ldquo;Care to make a girl happy?\u0026rdquo; she asked, knowing the answer.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said, turning. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen anything more beautiful in my entire life.\u0026rdquo; The setting sun framed Rose in silhouette, the orange and red sky reaching back from the horizon. Her breathing caused her chest to rise and fall as she slowly turned her head towards him.\n\u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t answer the question,\u0026rdquo; she said in a sultry tone.\n\u0026ldquo;How\u0026rsquo;s this for an answer,\u0026rdquo; he said as he quickly strode across the small hut and pulled her into his arms, kissing her soundly. Their bodies pushed together, and Rose could feel his hard on press into her belly, her breasts flattened against his chest. She leaned into his arms, enjoying the strength and support she found there.\nHe lifted his head back from the beautiful creature, and gazed into her eyes. He saw her eyes glisten in the setting sun, love, lust, and need pouring from them. The look Rose was giving him nearly broke his heart; it was so beautiful.\n\u0026ldquo;You gave up everything for me,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I gained everything,\u0026rdquo; she said huskily as she pulled him down for another kiss. \u0026ldquo;Make love to me,\u0026rdquo; she pleaded. \u0026ldquo;Make me yours.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are mine, more than you can know,\u0026rdquo; he said, stooping to sweep her off her feet.\nShe tucked her head into his neck as he walked the two steps over to the bed and set her down. As he released her, she arched back onto the bed, pushing her breasts high into the air. She looked at Trevor and felt her stomach clench with excitement as she watched him watch her, mesmerized.\n\u0026ldquo;Am I good enough to be your mate?\u0026rdquo; she asked, as she lowered her arms to her sides, slowly raising her hands up over her hips. \u0026ldquo;Am I woman enough?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, baby,\u0026rdquo; Trevor growled, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re more woman than I have ever seen.\u0026rdquo; He watched her as her hands caressed her own wide hips. \u0026ldquo;You will be the most beautiful mermaid tomorrow morning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Have you been looking at the other mermaids?\u0026rdquo; she asked coyly, bringing her hands up to the undersides of her breasts, lightly stroking her abdomen and sides, her body twitching as she hovered between sensuality and tickling herself.\n\u0026ldquo;Yesterday, after our argument,\u0026rdquo; he said, his eyes riveted on her breasts. \u0026ldquo;I watched MuSu and his three girls make love in one of the small coves on the eastern edge of the island.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What did you see?\u0026rdquo; she asked, moving her hands up to her breasts, stroking all around her nipples, but not touching them. She loved the way she was feeling, her body was tingling everywhere, and her nipples felt like two sparks of fire four inches above her ribs. She encircled both nipples and pulled them up into two points. \u0026ldquo;Ahhhhhh, tell me what you saw.\u0026rdquo;\nTrevor reached down to his own stiff penis, and began to stroke it slowly. \u0026ldquo;One of the girls pinned MuSu on the sand, and was fucking him, while the other two were fingering each other nearby.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Could you hear them?\u0026rdquo; Rose asked, pulling her nipples back and forth, feeling her breasts shift back and forth. Her hips began to sway back and forth as her arousal built.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, they were very loud when they came,\u0026rdquo; he said, his breathing now growing ragged as he watched Rose masturbate in front of him. She let one of her breasts go, and she snaked down one hand to her groin, pulling on the dark hairs that curled above her sex.\n\u0026ldquo;Is that why you agreed to my proposal?\u0026rdquo; she asked, her hips rising and falling as she stroked herself, watching his eyes watch her. \u0026ldquo;Because the mermaids were having sex together? Did you imagine that you would become a mermaid and make love to another mermaid?\u0026rdquo;\nTrevor watched as her fingers rubbed her pussy lips, their circles growing in intensity and effort. He could see beads of sweat on her lips as she spoke, her beautiful face a mask of lust.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes \u0026hellip; I did,\u0026rdquo; he said, his cock aching, throbbing in his hand.\n\u0026ldquo;And now, I \u0026hellip; will \u0026hellip; be \u0026hellip; that \u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip; mer \u0026hellip; mer oooooooh, mermaid!\u0026rdquo; Rose cried as she was engulfed by a powerful orgasm that caused her to curl up in a ball, her body shaking as she cried out her release.\nTrevor took his hand away from his cock, barely staving off his own orgasm, and watched his new lover quake through her pleasure, her body convulsing, her upper body rising off the bed with each wave that rolled through her torso. When it passed, she spread her legs, and raised her arms to him.\n\u0026ldquo;Take me,\u0026rdquo; she said simply.\nHe knelt on the bed between her outspread legs, his cock straining out from his body. A light sheen of sweat covered both their bodies. He bent forward and smelled the sweet smell of her arousal. He took two fingers, and pushed them into her sopping opening as she mewled in pleasure. Her insides were on fire, a molten mixture of heat and liquid, and the muscles of her vagina pulsing and grabbing at his fingers. He withdrew them slowly, watching her as she whimpered. He brought his index finger to his lips and slowly sank it into his mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;Ummmmm, good,\u0026rdquo; he said as he withdrew his finger with a pop. \u0026ldquo;You try,\u0026rdquo; he said, extending his middle finger towards her mouth.\nRose tasted herself for the first time, and found the sweet tangy taste irresistible, and she sucked hard on Trevor\u0026rsquo;s finger. With her hands, she reached down and pulled his thick cock towards her steaming crotch. She raised her legs in a V, and rubbed his cock along her cleft.\n\u0026ldquo;Take me,\u0026rdquo; she repeated, dropping her hand from his cock, now lodged at the entrance to her vagina.\nTrevor brought his other hand forward and pressed himself into a push up position, his arms pinning Rose\u0026rsquo;s arms to her sides, his cock angled into her pussy, with her legs reaching around his hips to draw him into her.\n\u0026ldquo;Now,\u0026rdquo; she pleaded, arching her hips towards his.\nTrevor slammed the first stroke home, and Rose immediately dissolved into a massive orgasm, pulling and clutching at him, her body rocked to its core by the pulsations that swept through her body. She cried out, again and again, as her vagina clutched at his cock, squeezing it, pulling it deeper into her body. When her orgasm slowed, he began to stroke slowly in and out of her, hitting the last inch with force, causing her body to shake, her breasts rocking on her chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; so \u0026hellip; good \u0026hellip; keep \u0026hellip; doing \u0026hellip; that \u0026hellip; right \u0026hellip; there \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she pleaded, her body lost in the pleasures that overwhelmed her. She loved the feel of her breasts slapping her chin, of her hips being pounded into the bed, and the fullness of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s stiff cock as it drilled into the center of her being. \u0026ldquo;I \u0026hellip; want \u0026hellip; to \u0026hellip; make \u0026hellip; you \u0026hellip; happy,\u0026rdquo; she said with each stroke he pounded into her. She looked up into his blue eyes, and she reached up with her hands, trying to over come the pounding she was getting, to hold his face. She settled instead for holding onto his shoulders, as she needed the stability as Trevor increased his pace, pounding into her like a jackhammer.\n\u0026ldquo;Ooooohhhhhh, my \u0026hellip; my \u0026hellip; my \u0026hellip; goooooooooooooooooood,\u0026rdquo; She screamed as she felt the largest orgasm of all sweep upwards from her groin, every muscle in her abdomen pulsing with pleasure.\nTrevor released himself into his lover, groaning, feeling great ropes of cum splash into her. When the last of his spurts faded away, he lowered himself onto her, kissing her tenderly as she continued to quiver and shake, her orgasmic tremors lasting for several minutes.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not just sex,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s love.\u0026rdquo;\nShe only smiled, still twitching, unable to speak.\nTo be continued?\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/changes-in-paradise09/","tags":["mermaids","transgender","transformation"],"title":"Changes in Paradise: Part 09 - Autopsies, Admirals, and Adversaries"},{"categories":["Mermaids"],"contents":"Trevor and Rose finish their changes, Pat makes new discoveries about mermaid bodies, new potential mers arrive on Mermaid Island. The saga continues\nPat floated on her back in the open sea just outside the mer\u0026rsquo;s entrance to their \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo; in the western caves. The moon was a mere sliver of light, nearly lost among the vast swath of stars that flowed across the dark expanse of the sky. What a lonely little moon, Pat thought to herself as the small waves pushed her body back and forth. I know just how you feel. You were once of this earth, she thought, and now you are slowly slipping away. Like the moon, she felt that her sense of the world was slipping further and further away, even as she was sure that the world would soon be knocking on their door.\nShe sighed, filled with a growing sense of foreboding, a fear that sharpened as she felt her daughter stir in her womb. She and John agreed on \u0026ldquo;Maureen\u0026rdquo; for their impending daughter\u0026rsquo;s name, which honored Pat\u0026rsquo;s own Celtic heritage and meant, \u0026ldquo;born of the sea\u0026rdquo; in Gaelic. Her entire pod decided on names in the wake of Liga\u0026rsquo;s premature delivery. Naming did not lessen her unease, and tonight, waves of fear washed over her. Was the sharp sliver of pain in her chest more than fear of the future; was it fear of childbirth, she wondered? Maybe she was simply grieving the loss of her own family\u0026ndash;she had two siblings, after all. Would she ever see her brother and sister again?\nPat watched the sky as the waves pushed her back and forth, feeling her hair caress her shoulders, back, and sides as her breasts rocked up and down. She could sense a shark wending its way towards her, but she knew that it would pass her by. The sea was full of activity, even in the dark of night, and Pat reached out as far as she could with her mer-senses. There was nothing large in the water anywhere nearby. She was alone, for the moment, and she felt alone, as a mermaid. It had been so strange, wonderful but strange, all these changes. A little over two years ago, she had been a man. Now, she was a mermaid.\nShe imagined her older brother, Cory, meeting her for the first time. He was very religious, and he had disapproved of Patrick\u0026rsquo;s wandering, scientific, environmental-activist lifestyle. The last time they spoke, nearly five years ago, he argued that evolution was bunk, and that everything was pre-ordained by God. All Patrick had to do, Cory urged, was to \u0026ldquo;let go and let God.\u0026rdquo; Right. Pat almost smiled to herself, thinking of what her brother would say if he, like Liga, was forcibly changed into a mermaid. How would he fit that change into his worldview? Would that make her invention of the goop an act of God? Maybe, she thought. Maybe.\nShe looked out into the deep darkness of the sky, wondering how many other civilizations there were out there among the countless stars and galaxies. Were there mermaids out there too? Could they help protect their fledgling community of mers? Cory was like many people Pat remembered, always puzzled as to why someone should spend their life trying to save people and the planet rather than save the people\u0026rsquo;s souls. They had fought countless times after Pat had gone to college, and (his) older brother disapproved of Pat\u0026rsquo;s views on life, religion, the universe and everything. There was only one bright light, she thought to herself; her parents were already dead. The thought of introducing herself to them was worse than anything Cory could do.\nHer sister, Bridget, was a different story. She was the eldest, Patrick was the youngest, and was the only girl: but not any more, Pat thought ruefully. Bridget mothered both of her younger brothers, but Patrick had always felt especially close to her. Now she taught high school English in a rural school in Oregon and was something of a free spirit. Bridget had been married once, but now Pat suspected that she was either in a Boston marriage or an outright lesbian. Pat smiled as she imagined her sister\u0026rsquo;s face when she heard the news from Mermaid Island. Bridget would be totally cool with her new sister. Hopefully, Hank and Janice would be able to find her.\nAs for the rest of humanity, Pat thought, well, they were going to be in for a big surprise. She was hopeful that enough people would be accepting, and perhaps some like Sally and Eric who would eagerly seek to join their community. But she knew her brother, and he would react with fear and loathing. She cataloged all the conversations that she had had with the other mers about their families, pasts, and suspicions about the \u0026ldquo;real world.\u0026rdquo; Galina and Alexis in particular were adamant that the Russian military would stop at nothing to exploit the siren cell. None of the mers completely trusted their previous governments, and Gabriel was more worried about religious extremism than secular government reaction.\nPat\u0026rsquo;s fears throbbed in her chest. How could they re-enter the world without becoming pawns to some military group, or the scientific community, or simply becoming sideshow freaks? There were far too few mermaids to insure that someone or some country that wanted to use mermaid milk or mermaids themselves for nefarious purposes would leave them alone at best, or kidnap some or all of them at worst. She felt completely vulnerable, especially with her daughter growing within her body. Her heart pounded as she thought of Maureen trapped in a secret tank in the Nevada dessert, probes attached to her body as faceless scientists drew fluids from her small form.\nShe pushed that thought from her mind, and focused again on the stars and the small sliver of the moon. She felt Maureen stirring in her womb again; her baby had both doubled in size in the last month and become more active. Maureen\u0026rsquo;s flukes pushed gently against the sides of her womb as the little mermaid rolled over, her tail pressing on Pat\u0026rsquo;s cervix. Would she go into early labor like Liga? She ran her hands over her now swollen belly, up along her not quite trim waist to her breasts that were pointing into the night air as she lay horizontally along the surface of the waves. Soon her breasts would be giving nourishment to her daughter, and she briefly wondered which of the two boys, Trevor or Robbie, would come to know the special joy she felt as she tweaked her nipples in the starlight.\nShe flicked her flukes out of the water, spraying her torso and face with water, and she rubbed the weariness from her eyes. The cool, salt water felt good, as she stared into the night sky. She raised her head, looking down at her body, watching it float effortlessly along the surface. How did she do that, she suddenly wondered, the scientist in her awakening. Normally, when mermaids were completely relaxed or sleeping, their natural buoyancy was a few meters below the surface of the water. Yet, now she was easily staying on the surface of the water with no movements of her fins or flukes.\nWell, if it works with conception, Pat thought to herself, the links between what a mermaid\u0026rsquo;s mind was thinking and how her body responded was worth exploring. She focused her mind on not floating. After a few seconds of mental effort, she started sinking. She continued her focus on relaxing and continued to drift down. She noted that she was in the normal mer vertical position about three meters below the surface. She focused on becoming heavier, on sinking, and after a few seconds, she started to sink again, gaining speed as she concentrated. For several minutes, she descended into the dark water, gaining speed as she kept concentrating. She could feel the water pressure growing, pressing in on her, but not nearly as much as she thought it would. After five more minutes of concentration, she could feel the water rushing past her as she sank like a rock. She remembered back to the thrill of salvaging the Russian submarine, descending into that dark world hundreds of meters below the surface.\nAs her mer-vision adapted to the near blackness of the sea around her, she looked up along the sheer underwater cliff that ran down from the western side of Mermaid Island and estimated that she was at least two hundred meters down, but the pressure against her body didn\u0026rsquo;t feel much more than two atmospheres (about 29 psi), or the equivalent of 10 meters under water. The mers had simply taken it for granted that they could survive in deep water, but now she was engaged by the puzzle. She concentrated on stopping, staying at this depth, and very quickly, she stopped moving. How was she doing this? She reached out with her mer-senses, focusing on her own body. She was comfortable, but there was a slight tightness along her tail, spine, and dorsal ridge.\nShe looked down at her tail, and noticed that it was flickering very faintly in a pattern that started in her dorsal ridge and radiated down and around her tail in regular waves. Her elbow fins were also flickering with the faintest lines of energy. These were not the same patterns of light emitted during sex, she noted. Their sexual luminescence was wildly random, flicking across their tails like a summer storm, bright, intense, and chaotic. These faint flickering patterns were regular and uniformly shaped. She reached out into the black sea with her hands, and felt a slight increase in pressure press against her hands and wrists. The water felt colder further away from her torso. She drew back her hand, and then repeated the experiment to each side. She found the same result, about eighteen inches (45 cm) out from her body, the pressure of the sea was slightly more, but within that circle, the pressure appeared to be a little more than about two atmospheres.\nShe remembered some of the mers complaining that their hands were sore as they salvaged the Russian submarine, but now she suspected that it was not soreness from over work but rather from the intense chill and pressure. She focused on floating, and tried to pay attention to what her body was doing. She felt a slight surge of tingling along her spine and dorsal ridge, most of the tingling originating in her dorsal ridge between her hips and knees. She twisted around and could see that her fringe along her entire dorsal ridge was stiff and straight, rising up from her back like the teeth of a rake, which explained the tension she felt along the entire length of her dorsal fringe, from her shoulder blades to her flukes. The tingling seemed to originate in her upper tail. That was the location of the mer\u0026rsquo;s third or lower electrical organ. Perhaps their third organ created an electromagnetic field of some kind, one that shielded them from the intense pressures.\nIf it was an electromagnetic field, it did not appear to extend much beyond her body. Her body was now rising, and she relaxed her focus on floating and returned to the puzzle. The electromagnetic field did not circle outward from her core, like similar fields generated by planets or magnets. It appeared to be bound up inside her body, limited to the surface of her skin. Perhaps the nano-structured skin and scales that made their bodies hydrophobic also focused and transmitted whatever force their lower organ was producing.\nGoing back in her mind, she remembered the autopsies. The dark, gray fibers that left the lower organ on Agba and Angara followed the same body channels as their nerves from their spinal chord, but those fibers, unlike the ones from both the middle and upper electronic organs, did not intersect with their neural network. Those gray filaments had mirrored their nerves throughout their body, but did not meet. The top organ was attached directly to the spinal cord, and the middle organ made several connections between the top organ and bottom one, but other than that, the top and bottom systems did not intersect.\nWithout an electron microscope Pat could not begin to map how their electromagnetic organs, nerves, and skin structures might be working together, and she suspected that the nano-structures that made their skin both strong and soft contributed to the process. Perhaps it was like superconductivity, she mused. The right materials in the right alignment allowed a normally weak force to be stronger.\nAs she neared the surface, her ears popped, reminding her of playing in a pool as a youngster. She saw that her tail was no longer luminescent, and could feel that her dorsal ridge was now relaxed. She also sensed someone approaching from the entrance to their caves, three someone\u0026rsquo;s, in fact, three very special someone\u0026rsquo;s. John, Danni, and Phoebe emerged from the underwater tunnel and made their way towards Pat. For a brief instant, a small part of her resented the intrusion into her solitary reflection, but that part was banished as the warmth and love from her pod washed over her.\n\u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t sleep?\u0026rdquo; asked John, as he rose upwards with her.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; she answered, as her head broke the surface into the night air, followed by her tail rising to the surface of the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Maureen?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni, as she allowed her tail to rise, floating horizontally next to Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered, rubbing her swollen tummy. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s quiet tonight.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well Freya is kicking up a storm,\u0026rdquo; Danni complained, running her hands across her slowly undulating belly.\n\u0026ldquo;What were you doing?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe. \u0026ldquo;We could sense you for a while, but then you disappeared from our mer-senses. That\u0026rsquo;s why we came out looking for you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Experimenting,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered grinning. \u0026ldquo;I think I may have discovered how we survive depths and such, but we can work on it later and try to confirm my suspicions. How\u0026rsquo;s Cynthia doing?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s quiet,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe answered. \u0026ldquo;What brought you out here, before you started experimenting?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And woke us up?\u0026rdquo; added John.\n\u0026ldquo;That is one disadvantage to mermaid bonding,\u0026rdquo; Danni said. \u0026ldquo;Your headache is everyone\u0026rsquo;s headache.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I was just worried about everyone that is headed our way,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered with a sigh as all three of her pod-mates surrounded her. \u0026ldquo;We have Bill and Mae, Sally\u0026rsquo;s Dad, Alberto\u0026rsquo;s boss, and who knows else all ready to pounce on our little slice of paradise.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And Hank and Janice,\u0026rdquo; Danni added.\n\u0026ldquo;What about Hank and Janice?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe. \u0026ldquo;I thought they were on our side?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They are, but Robbie is either going to be a merman or a mermaid, and either way, we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to explain why we allowed that to happen,\u0026rdquo; Danni explained.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not worried about Hank and Janice,\u0026rdquo; John said dismissively. \u0026ldquo;I talked about that possibility before they left. Janice even predicted Robbie would become a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, well. Good. Because I\u0026rsquo;ll bet that Trevor won the wrestling match,\u0026rdquo; Danni said.\n\u0026ldquo;No way. The match was Robbie\u0026rsquo;s idea, and you saw how much weight he put on in the last three weeks. You\u0026rsquo;re on,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the wager?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Five un-requited orgasms,\u0026rdquo; Danni said with a smile.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a horny little mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, is it a bet?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a bet,\u0026rdquo; she agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Um \u0026hellip; it is midnight, and we all need rest,\u0026rdquo; John reminded everyone. \u0026ldquo;Can we go back to sleep?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry John,\u0026rdquo; Pat sighed. \u0026ldquo;What am I going to say to Bill and Mae? Even better, what am I going to say to my family when we finally contact them again?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Bill and Mae are easy, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about them,\u0026rdquo; John reassured her. \u0026ldquo;Cory hasn\u0026rsquo;t come looking for you, has he?\u0026rdquo;\nPat shook her head.\n\u0026ldquo;We have no idea how successful Hank will be in convincing them to visit, especially since he can\u0026rsquo;t tell them the truth.\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;I know you\u0026rsquo;re worried, but you do have a family, one that loves you very much.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, John,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you and—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We know you didn\u0026rsquo;t mean anything like that,\u0026rdquo; John gently cut her off. \u0026ldquo;And we can only do what we can do. First, let\u0026rsquo;s worry about Malaki, Sally\u0026rsquo;s father, and the rest of the world. Then we can worry about our family members.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I guess you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;But I still worry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will work it out,\u0026rdquo; Danni reassured her. \u0026ldquo;Something big is going to break through for us, I can tell.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked skeptically.\n\u0026ldquo;Women\u0026rsquo;s intuition,\u0026rdquo; Danni answered, caressing Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, and what is your woman\u0026rsquo;s intuition telling you now?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked as her breasts reacted to Danni\u0026rsquo;s touch.\n\u0026ldquo;That the lively little mermaids in our bellies would calm down if we attended to some quality bonding time,\u0026rdquo; Danni said, letting her tail sink and wrapping it around Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;I really like your thinking. Let\u0026rsquo;s go back to the cave,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, her breathing rising as Danni caressed her body.\n\u0026ldquo;Not before I take some of your action,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;You want some of this \u0026hellip; ooohhh \u0026hellip; action?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked, as Danni pinched her nipple.\n\u0026ldquo;Five unrequited orgasms says Trevor won,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, wrapping her own tail around her sister-wives', pressing her belly to their equally swollen bellies.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, you want a piece of that action?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe challenged, struggling to maintain her composure as her sister wives caressed her breasts, belly, and tail. \u0026ldquo;Fine. Double it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;You want to give us each ten if we win and us give you ten if you win?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yep,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re on, chump!\u0026rdquo; Danni said giggling.\n\u0026ldquo;John, do you want some of this action?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The only action I want is back in the Moon Pool, with each of you pressed against MY body,\u0026rdquo; John said, cocking an eyebrow at his mermaids. \u0026ldquo;Last one back is on my fins for the first two rounds,\u0026rdquo; he said as he turned for the caves.\nAll three mermaids giggled and squealed in delight, turning into the water and giving chase to the merman who retreated before them. Pat was last, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t mind. Maureen decided that it was a good time to test out her tail in the womb. But Danni was right, after a few quality orgasms, everyone, including the mermaids in their wombs, settled back down to sleep.\nRose blinked in the early morning light, her hair falling across her face as she eased into wakefulness. Her eyelids languidly opened and closed, while she remembered the previous evening. She and Trevor had made love countless times; their last coupling was in the hot tub in the starlight. She smiled at the memory, but something was pressing into her thigh, a warm stiffness that poked into her soft, round leg. She carefully eased herself away from Trevor\u0026rsquo;s morning hard on, rolling onto her back. She could feel her breasts shift as she settled herself back into the bed.\nShe glanced over at Trevor, who was still sound asleep, his breathing even, his lips parted, and his blond hair pushed up into a faux-hawk. She smiled at his hair, his bed-mussed-head, and reached across her body to smooth it down, feeling the mass of her own breast getting in her way. She stopped reaching, and looked down at the cleavage she had created, a cleavage that she had never before possessed. Her breasts; she never thought that she would ever have to think about such a thing. Why was she so accepting of her change? Was that normal? She would have to talk to the other mermaids who were formerly men about their experiences.\nShe relaxed her arm and watched as her new breasts returned to their previous positions, her nipples pointing into the cool morning air. God, what would her parents think of her now, she wondered. Who were her parents recruiting to be her (Robbie\u0026rsquo;s) pod-mates? What would happen when they got here and discovered that Robbie was no longer qualified to be a pod-leader. Who would not become Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pod-mates now that Rose had become one? What would her sisters think? Would they become her new pod mates with Trevor? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t she be more worried about her sex change? Should her body feel this wonderful? She blinked as the questions rushed through her still sleepy mind. But she was not worried, she answered herself, and her new body did feel wonderful, she grinned remembering last night\u0026rsquo;s orgasms.\nThere was one question, however, that would not be dismissed, one that she now focused on with eager anticipation. What kind of mermaid would she become? Her breathing quickened as she mused on her impending change. Mermaid \u0026hellip; mermaid \u0026hellip; wait, there was something tickling her along her back. She eased herself up from the bed and went over to the mirror, twisting to look at her back. She pulled her long and thick hair over the front of her shoulder and looked at her long and shapely back.\nTwo long strands of red skin stretched from above her shoulder blades down to the small of her back on either side of her spine. The strips narrowed until they were a point about an inch above the two dimples that marked the top of her ass. Her gills were appearing, and they should be ready after one more feeding later in the morning. She swayed her hips, watching her body move back and forth move in the mirror. She loved the feeling of weight along her hips, rather than along her torso when she was a guy. She could feel her new body parts move\u0026ndash;her breasts and her hips\u0026ndash;and she loved the way her waist felt so insubstantial, so thin.\nShe turned in profile again, admiring the curves and slopes her body possessed. There was still enough of Robbie left inside that she was in lust with her own body. Her breasts hung like two large teardrops from her chest, their soft contours bulging away from her ribs. Her new nipples crinkled tightly as she watched her arousal grow, rising from the pink areolas at the center of each breast. She ran her hands down her torso, feeling her waist narrow down before flaring out to her hips. Her fingers traced the line of muscle that arched down from the top of each hip, flowing forward around her belly, tapering to a vee above her pubic hair. Beneath the soft tuft of hair, she could see her vagina swelling, opening, becoming wet. She imagined her legs growing into a tail, a bright red tail.\nShe turned and looked at Trevor, still sleeping, and felt her cunt twitch in anticipation. She walked around the other side of the bed and examined Trevor\u0026rsquo;s back. There were two strands of red skin on his back too.\nShe reached out with her fingers and stroked the red patches very lightly. Trevor moaned in his sleep, shifting away from her touch. She giggled softly and eased her body down onto the bed behind him, pressing her body along his, feeling her nipples press into his nascent gills, her belly pressing into the small of his back. She reached around the still sleeping man and carefully grabbed his stiff cock. She remembered back to the last time she masturbated as a man, only two days ago, and she smiled at the memory. She had no regrets, and she could still play with a cock anytime she wanted to, she thought as she slowly stroked Trevor\u0026rsquo;s stiff penis.\n\u0026ldquo;Now that is what I call an alarm clock,\u0026rdquo; he said huskily.\n\u0026ldquo;Today\u0026rsquo;s weather calls for a one hundred percent chance of fucking,\u0026rdquo; Rose said softly into his ear. \u0026ldquo;With strong orgasms coming down from the north. The five day forecast calls for increased fucking as mer tails develop within the western caves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are the latest developments in business news?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Stock prices are rising,\u0026rdquo; she said as she grabbed the base of his penis and gave it a good squeeze. \u0026ldquo;And the market looks forward to sustained growth in key areas.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Entertainment?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;A rising star of beach and lagoon was spotted last night at Club Hot Tub,\u0026rdquo; she giggled. \u0026ldquo;Where a handsome young stud gave her a thorough going over on the dance floor. Spectators were left breathless with the skill the two dancers exhibited.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And sports?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;In baseball news today,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Rookie Trevor Green hit five home runs last night with no errors. Rumor has it that he will repeat this extraordinary feat in a day game this morning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Rookie?\u0026rdquo; he challenged.\n\u0026ldquo;Weren\u0026rsquo;t you a virgin?\u0026rdquo; she teased. \u0026ldquo;You mean, I\u0026rsquo;m not gasp your first?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, and no one plays baseball in the morning,\u0026rdquo; he said as he felt her rubbing her breasts across his back, which felt more sensitive than it had previously.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s fine,\u0026rdquo; she said, licking and kissing his neck. \u0026ldquo;Because I don\u0026rsquo;t want to play baseball.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you want to play?\u0026rdquo; he asked, feeling her stroking increase in speed and strength.\n\u0026ldquo;I think you can figure it out, if you\u0026rsquo;re smart enough,\u0026rdquo; she said, kissing and nipping his shoulders and neck.\n\u0026ldquo;Tiddlywinks?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Nope,\u0026rdquo; she giggled, swirling the drops of precum around his crown with her index finger, watching his hips twitch as she pushed and pulled on his cock. \u0026ldquo;Maybe you really were a virgin?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Backgammon?\u0026rdquo; he asked, squirming at her increasingly frantic touch.\n\u0026ldquo;Guess again,\u0026rdquo; she said, biting down on his shoulder hard enough to make a mark.\n\u0026ldquo;Hide the sausage?\u0026rdquo; He squawked as he felt her teeth nearly break skin.\n\u0026ldquo;Close,\u0026rdquo; she giggled, kissing him where she had marked him.\n\u0026ldquo;Pluck a Rose?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck the Rose,\u0026rdquo; she demanded, pulling him onto his back by his cock.\n\u0026ldquo;How about the Rose fucks me?\u0026rdquo; he asked as he looked up at her body, her breasts pressing into his stomach.\n\u0026ldquo;Tempting, but I have something else in mind,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;And what would that be?\u0026rdquo; he asked smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;We are about to lose our legs,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;And I want to lose them; I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to become a mermaid. So, I want to make love standing up, with you behind me, because that position will never again be available to us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Deal,\u0026rdquo; he said rising, his cock bouncing. \u0026ldquo;Where?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Over here,\u0026rdquo; she said, rising and crossing to the window of the hut, overlooking the lagoon far below.\nShe took his hand as he crossed to her, and placed it on her breast, feeling her nipple stiffen further under his hand. She reached up with her other hand and guided his face towards hers.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so happy we didn\u0026rsquo;t wait,\u0026rdquo; she said as she kissed him.\nTrevor felt her generous lips envelop his, her tongue seeking his, and her body pressing up into his. He cupped her ass with one hand and ran the other over the small of her back, feeling her tiny waist and the rough patches of her newly formed gills. She moaned into the kiss, and reached down to stroke his cock. Trevor reached around her hips and felt her crotch and found it dripping.\n\u0026ldquo;God, you\u0026rsquo;re so hot,\u0026rdquo; he said, pushing two fingers into her, feeling her abdomen tense.\nRose shuddered as his insistent fingers wiggled into her new vagina, his other hand resting on her heaving chest, her nipple pressed into his palm. Her eyes were lidded with passion, and she jerked on his cock, barely able to control her limbs. They continued to stimulate one another, watching each other\u0026rsquo;s faces as their passion built.\n\u0026ldquo;I want you,\u0026rdquo; she said, twisting around, forcing his fingers from her, and resting her arms on the sill of the window. \u0026ldquo;Now.\u0026rdquo;\nShe lowered her shoulders and pushed her hips up, rising on her tiptoes, thrusting her butt towards him. Her breasts dangled heavily from her ribs, brushing the windowsill as she gyrated her hips. Her hair cascaded over her shoulders, flowing like a river of ink over her pale white skin. She spread her feet slightly, feeling her sex open like a wet flower, her juices running down her legs.\n\u0026ldquo;Take me,\u0026rdquo; she said, panting with need.\nTrevor grabbed his stiff cock and aimed it at her pink lips, and slowly pushed it into her. She moaned as each inch stretched her open, her flesh rippling around the pole as it snaked its way into her, her hips swaying back and forth as together they worked his stiff pole into her body. When he bottomed out, he grabbed her hips and steadied them, moving his own hips instead, feeling his cock slide wetly within her.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re so wet,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Ummmmm, you have no idea,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t tell you how good it feels.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Try,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Ohhhhhh, why?\u0026rdquo; she moaned. \u0026ldquo;Are you thinking of \u0026hellip; ummmmm \u0026hellip; becoming a mermaid too?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he said, pulling out slightly and then pushing back in. \u0026ldquo;I want to know what you\u0026rsquo;re feeling.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, god,\u0026rdquo; she gasped, feeling his strong cock move through her body. \u0026ldquo;Every part of me is on fire, burning—uugh, that feels good,\u0026rdquo; she said as he bottomed out again. \u0026ldquo;I can feel your cock in me, stretching me, filling me,\u0026rdquo; she whimpered, barely getting the words out of her mouth. \u0026ldquo;I love the way you grab my hips, pulling me onto your cock. I love the way my breasts sway with each stroke, and my nipples feel like little erections.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Keep talking,\u0026rdquo; he said, increasing his speed.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; my \u0026hellip; insides \u0026hellip; are \u0026hellip; squeezing \u0026hellip; your \u0026hellip; big \u0026hellip; cock,\u0026rdquo; she grunted with each stroke. \u0026ldquo;My \u0026hellip; legs \u0026hellip; are \u0026hellip; turning \u0026hellip; in \u0026hellip; to \u0026hellip; jelly.\u0026rdquo;\nTrevor could see her start to lose control, and he took her body weight into his arms, lifting her toes off the floor.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; god \u0026hellip; oh \u0026hellip; god \u0026hellip; oh,\u0026rdquo; she moaned.\nHe watched her slender back and shoulders as each stroke rippled up her back. Her ass shook, and then her spine took the force of each impact, and her breasts swung in circles below her chest, bulging outward as they swung madly with the force of his strokes. Her shoulders punched forward with each thrust he made. His stiff cock now supported her body weight, her feet were no longer touching the ground.\n\u0026ldquo;Talk \u0026hellip; to \u0026hellip; me,\u0026rdquo; he ordered, slamming into her.\n\u0026ldquo;Umm \u0026hellip; can\u0026rsquo;t \u0026hellip; mmmmm\u0026hellip; ooh \u0026hellip; cuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmiiiiiiiiiiiiggggggg,\u0026rdquo; she gasped and bucked back against his strokes, pushing herself with her arms into him.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, do it!\u0026rdquo; he said, pumping his hips back and forth as fast as he could. He could feel her Kegel muscles pulse against him, pulling and pushing at his cock. Her legs were kicking, shaking; her body was out of control, completely in the grips of her orgasm. She was now screaming in passion continuously, for at least a minute, and then her body slowly returned to her conscious control.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip; it \u0026hellip; like?\u0026rdquo; he asked, slowing his strokes as her thighs stopped shaking.\n\u0026ldquo;Ummm \u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip; I can\u0026rsquo;t \u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip; explain,\u0026rdquo; she gasped, trying to calm herself.\n\u0026ldquo;Try,\u0026rdquo; he urged, slowing his strokes and setting her toes back down on the ground. \u0026ldquo;Stand up.\u0026rdquo;\nRose stood on her shaking legs, feeling Trevor\u0026rsquo;s long cock still buried inside her, the tip of his cock now pressing firmly into the knot of nerves that was her G-spot. Her entire body seemed to be vibrating. She could feel the muscles in her legs quivering, making it difficult to stand.\n\u0026ldquo;Tell me,\u0026rdquo; he whispered into her ear as she leaned back into him.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, god, it feels so good,\u0026rdquo; she said, rocking her hips back into him. \u0026ldquo;I feel you inside me, and my whole belly feels full of you. My skin tingles all over, and I can\u0026rsquo;t stop my legs from shaking. Oh, right there, keep going, right there,\u0026rdquo; she moaned as Trevor angled his hips down, and started stroking more quickly.\n\u0026ldquo;A pressure is building \u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip; in my abdomen,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Where?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t know \u0026hellip; oh \u0026hellip; higher up than when I was a guy,\u0026rdquo; she continued, moaning and cooing as she talked. \u0026ldquo;Right behind your cock, ah \u0026hellip; near the top of your cock.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about your breasts?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, they feel heavy,\u0026rdquo; she said, bringing one hand up to her breasts, caressing them. \u0026ldquo;And hot, and tingly \u0026hellip; faster, go faster \u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip; yes, that\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m getting close \u0026hellip; my nipples ache \u0026hellip; so good \u0026hellip; harder \u0026hellip; ahhh \u0026hellip; oh, come with me,\u0026rdquo; she pleaded, pressing her hips down into each stroke.\n\u0026ldquo;Talk,\u0026rdquo; he said urgently.\n\u0026ldquo;The \u0026hellip; pressure \u0026hellip; is \u0026hellip; building \u0026hellip; tightening \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip; coming,\u0026rdquo; she was now pushing back with nearly the same force as Trevor was using to thrust forward, their bodies were slapping against one another\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;Colors \u0026hellip; in \u0026hellip; my \u0026hellip; eyes \u0026hellip; ah \u0026hellip; ah \u0026hellip; pressure \u0026hellip; building \u0026hellip; so \u0026hellip; good \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s coming \u0026hellip; waves pushing \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m going to \u0026hellip; going to \u0026hellip;,\u0026rdquo; her mouth formed the shape of the word \u0026ldquo;come,\u0026rdquo; but no sound emerged. Her body was frozen, and Trevor held himself deep within her, unmoving. He could feel the pressure around his cock build, slowly squeezing down, further and further, until suddenly, Rose screamed, her body shaking all over, her legs collapsed as they began twitching uncontrollably, and Trevor took her entire body weight into his hands.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, yes,\u0026rdquo; he hissed as he resumed pounding into her, feeling her juices flow over his thighs as she thrashed and moaned, her legs dangling from her hips as he held her. He slammed into her a final time, finding his own earth shattering release, gripping her waist, pulling back on her hips as he spurted into her, like a male spider about to become her breakfast, unknowing, uncaring, and unbelievably overwhelmed by pleasure.\nRose rode the waves of pleasure, her eyes clenched shut, her legs dangling from Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pulsing cock, feeling wave after wave rolling through her body, unconscious of anything other than the burning sensation she felt deep within her womb, a wet hotness that tingled and throbbed. Slowly, she stopped shaking, and she rested her forehead on the windowsill, smelling the fresh morning sent of the jungle and the musky smell of their sex. She could feel Trevor\u0026rsquo;s slowly deflating cock still within her, and she gave it a good squeeze, forcing it slowly from her now satisfied vagina.\n\u0026ldquo;The next time we make love, we will be mers,\u0026rdquo; she sighed.\n\u0026ldquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t see how it can get any better,\u0026rdquo; he said, still feeling the after shocks of his own orgasm.\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s only one way find out,\u0026rdquo; she said, wobbling on shaky legs towards the door. \u0026ldquo;Race you down to the beach?\u0026rdquo;\nTrevor watched as Rose dove into the pool, the bright mid-morning sun illuminating the Moon Pool, her wake sending diamond flashes of sunlight dancing around the cave. She made a smooth line of bubbles into the center of the pool and came to rest a few meters below the surface. The walls of the pool glowed with a pale luminescence visible even in the sunlight, and the result was a crystal clear view of the pool all the way to the bottom ten meters below. She was surrounded by over a dozen mers of all shapes and colors, each of them positioned around the edge of the pool in perfect symmetry.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;ll be fine,\u0026rdquo; Petra reassured the pacing boy. \u0026ldquo;It will be done in less than thirty minutes. Stop pacing, you\u0026rsquo;re making Michelle nervous,\u0026rdquo; she warned as Michelle\u0026rsquo;s tail beat against her mother\u0026rsquo;s hip as she fed from her breast.\n\u0026ldquo;But you two aren\u0026rsquo;t helping,\u0026rdquo; Trevor worried. \u0026ldquo;Won\u0026rsquo;t that make it longer?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Liga answered, holding Mari to her breast as the littlest and newest mermaid wiggled in her grasp. \u0026ldquo;There are five pregnant mermaids down there. Our milk is stronger after pregnancy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And the Moon Pool is starting to be a force on its own,\u0026rdquo; Petra explained. \u0026ldquo;Pat and Phoebe discovered that there are microscopic organisms that have adapted to our presence and amplify the effects of the siren cell.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean by adapted and amplify?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked worriedly.\n\u0026ldquo;We are still not sure on the mechanics of how the siren cell works,\u0026rdquo; Petra admitted. \u0026ldquo;But we have been releasing a lot of mermaid milk into this pool on a regular basis for a long time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As you will discover when you change,\u0026rdquo; Liga smiled.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Trevor agreed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been told to expect the intensity of the need for sex after our transition. But what about these microscopic organisms? What are they doing to her?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing that the mermaid milk doesn\u0026rsquo;t already do,\u0026rdquo; Petra reassured him. \u0026ldquo;Phoebe discovered that the pool itself has become a catalyst, and that the change will now happen in minutes, even if there are only a few mermaids present. In fact, it is possible that in the future, anyone who wanders into the cave may find themselves affected by the siren cell even if no mermaids are here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that qualify the pool as a toxic site?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked, only half joking.\n\u0026ldquo;That would depend on whether or not you considered the effects a bad thing or not,\u0026rdquo; Liga speculated.\nTrevor watched as Rose moved to the next mer around the circle. He could see her grasp the very long cock of a merman with a black tail with silver highlights and bring it to her mouth. He felt a twinge of jealousy, and stifled a desire to jump into the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;Is that John?\u0026rdquo; he asked pointing.\n\u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s Gabriel,\u0026rdquo; Petra answered. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s my mate, and don\u0026rsquo;t worry, he is not going to steal your Rose from you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t say—\u0026rdquo; he protested.\n\u0026ldquo;No, you didn\u0026rsquo;t say,\u0026rdquo; Liga interrupted. \u0026ldquo;But your body did.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How can you tell?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Mer-senses,\u0026rdquo; Petra answered. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you remember anything from Emma\u0026rsquo;s lesson this morning?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t remember mer-senses,\u0026rdquo; Trevor admitted. \u0026ldquo;I was so excited about the change. She focused mostly on anatomy. What are mersenses ?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, she may not have covered them since we are still learning about them. We can sense one another\u0026rsquo;s electrical discharges, and those discharges are linked to mood, health, and identity,\u0026rdquo; Petra said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the only way we can tell the triplets apart.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;But you can do that even now, out of the water?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, for shorter distances in the air than in the water, but it\u0026rsquo;s easier when the subject is broadcasting his mood so loudly and clearly,\u0026rdquo; Petra teased.\nTrevor scowled and turned his attention back to the water, where Rose had moved onto the next mermaid, a small girl with a dark green tail and black hair. He could sense a power in the water, and he could hear a low tone, almost like humming, rise from the pool. Two mermaids swam below Rose and began stroking her legs. She then moved onto the next mermaid, a tall mermaid with a richly colored maroon tail with blue highlights and red hair.\n\u0026ldquo;Who will be her last?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe,\u0026rdquo; Petra answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Why Phoebe?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You are a curious one now,\u0026rdquo; Petra teased, shifting the now calmer Michelle to her other breast. \u0026ldquo;Because Phoebe was the first mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And that makes her special how?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Trevor!\u0026rdquo; Petra said exasperated, \u0026ldquo;Rose will be your last, and that is all you really need to worry about, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Now, relax. She\u0026rsquo;ll be fine, you\u0026rsquo;ll be next, and we can worry about Hank and Janice when they come back. You really are a bundle of nerves today.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; he blurted. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t seem to help myself.\u0026rdquo;\nThey all watched in silence, listening to the low hum rising from the pool, and the cooing of Michelle and Mari. Rose moved from mer to mer, and the pool began to shimmer with power. Trever began pacing again.\n\u0026ldquo;I am beginning to think that Robbie threw the wrestling match on purpose,\u0026rdquo; Liga mused.\n\u0026ldquo;Why do you say that?\u0026rdquo; Trevor snapped.\n\u0026ldquo;Because you are obviously NOT the stronger one,\u0026rdquo; she said with a soft smile to show she was teasing.\nTrevor blushed and stopped pacing. He turned back to the pool. Rose was now sucking on the breasts of a mermaid with a sea-blue tail and nearly white blond hair. Both Rose and the mermaid looked like they were having an orgasm. Rose\u0026rsquo;s black hair seemed longer, her legs even looked longer, and they were pointed stiffly towards the bottom of the pool. The two mermaids who had been stroking her legs rose to their original position around the edge of the ring. Rose broke away from Phoebe, her body rigid. She floated to the middle of the pool, her arms outstretched, and her legs pointed straight down.\nThe power in the cave intensified, and the two baby mermaids began to hum as they sucked on their mother\u0026rsquo;s breasts. Trevor could feel the hair on the back of his neck rise, but he wasn\u0026rsquo;t frightened so much as swept up in the rising energy. For several minutes, Rose hung in the water, unmoving, a soft glow emanating from her suspended body. Then she convulsed, her body undulating in the water, and Trevor could see that her legs had merged. After another few minutes, she began to slowly twirl in the center of the pool, moved by an unseen force, while more convulsions rolled through her body. Her hair was now down to her hips, and small fins had started to sprout from her hips and knees.\nHe remembered Emma\u0026rsquo;s description of what happened during the change as he watched from the edge of the pool. She explained that the bones in Rose\u0026rsquo;s legs were broken down into multiple joints that still attached to her pelvis. Her entire pelvic saddle was changing, and the interior was widening to accommodate her new mer-womb. The bone shaved from the inside of her pelvis would be redistributed as her pubic bone angled forward and broadened, becoming shaped more like her ilium, while the coxal bones shifted to her center of gravity, which made each femur lodge in a newly positioned ball joint that allowed mers to flex their tails 160-degrees forwards and backwards. A new, smaller joint grew in her pubic bone, higher and more forward along the pelvic saddle from where the femurs were originally attached. From those new sockets, her new pelvic fins pushed outward as he watched, growing from small bumps to strong, flesh-colored fins about 30 cm long.\nBelow her pelvic fins, each femur was broken into three separate bones, each new joint surrounded by new tendons so that their upper could flex about thirty degrees in any direction. At the base of both femurs, a new bridge joint, like a smaller pelvic saddle, anchored each femur together where her knees had been. This new joint could also flex nearly 150-degrees backwards and forwards, and the mid-tail fins grew from each side this new bridge. Even now, he could see these smaller fins reach their full length, about half as long as her pelvic fins.\nFrom her knees to her ankles, each tibia was reformed into two columns of six bones, all joints surrounded by tendons that allowed the bottom half of her tail to flex and twist 160-degrees in any direction. Emma explained that the now missing fibulas were probably used to create new bones in their fins and the bridge joints at their knees and ankles. The two multi-jointed tibias in her lower tail were attached to a new bridge joint where her ankles used to be that allowed her flukes to rotate 90-degrees in each direction like a pinwheel. From that joint, her metatarsals and phalanges stretched out into the long, bony ridges that supported and shaped each side of her nearly meter wide flukes. The flukes could flap up and down from her newly reformed tarsals (ankles), and each side of her flukes (each former foot) could move independently of the other.\nTrevor could see that her tail was now completely formed, and he watched her body shimmer in the water as a bright red color began to spread upwards from her flukes, slowly covering the entire length of her new tail. Her elbow fins, which he hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed before, also blossomed in the same red color. The trailing edges of all her fins and flukes sprouted a deep, black velvet fringe, and another black stripe of velvet rose up her dorsal ridge, reaching to the middle of her shoulder blades. A few more moments passed, and then her body shook in a final tremor, her body arching backwards upon itself, her flukes fluttering above her head. Suddenly, Rose relaxed in the water, and there was a palpable release of pressure in the cave while the light in the pool dimmed. She gave herself a push with her new tail, and rose to the surface.\nTrevor stood slack jawed as he watched Rose\u0026rsquo;s face emerge from the water. Her violet eyes sparkled with a jewel-like intensity, and her knowing smile seemed to burn with new knowledge and power. Her perfect white teeth were even except for the two incisors that were now sharp and pointed. Her round, full breasts bobbled in the water, her nipples slightly larger than they had been before. She looked at him like he was prey. They held each other\u0026rsquo;s gaze for a few seconds.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, what are you waiting for?\u0026rdquo; she asked in a silvery voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Um, aren\u0026rsquo;t you hungry?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked, gulping. \u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t Emma say that it took energy to do all this changing?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s only one thing I want to eat,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, growling. \u0026ldquo;Now get your ass into this pool.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;d better do as she says,\u0026rdquo; Petra warned, stifling a laugh. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t want to piss off a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\nTrevor looked nervously at Petra, Liga, and then back to Rose.\n\u0026ldquo;Well?\u0026rdquo; Rose said, rising up on her tail out of the water, her arms resting on her hips as her tail flashed back and forth in the water, churning the surface of the pool into a white froth.\nTrevor gasped at her display, awed by the power and sensuousness of her body and tail as it danced in the water. The water was cascading off her hydrophobic hair and skin, and her long dark hair swished around her shoulders and breasts as her tail flexed back and forth, keeping her torso well out of the water. Her breasts swung with each stroke of her tail, and the muscles in her tail and abdomen rippled and flexed hypnotically. Her bright red scales shimmered as her new strong muscles worked beneath the surface, and the velvety black fringes along the trailing edges of her elbow and pelvic fins danced in the air. The sound of churning water, like a waterfall, filled the cave. Mesmerized, Trevor blindly stepped towards the pool, missed his footing, and fell face first into the water. Rose pounced onto his flailing body and pulled him down into the center of the pool, kissing him. The other mermen all rose quickly from the water, giving room to their newest member.\n\u0026ldquo;The men never learn until it\u0026rsquo;s too late,\u0026rdquo; Petra mused, stroking her daughter\u0026rsquo;s hair as she suckled on her breast.\n\u0026ldquo;No, they don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Liga agreed as Eric slid up next to her and gave her a quick kiss.\n\u0026ldquo;Men don\u0026rsquo;t learn what?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;That they are not in charge,\u0026rdquo; Liga smiled, giving him a big kiss in return.\n\u0026ldquo;There are compensating forces,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said with amusement.\n\u0026ldquo;What did he just say?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We may not be in charge,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel laughed. \u0026ldquo;But having you for mates makes it worth the burden.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What burden is that?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked with mock anger.\n\u0026ldquo;The burden of being dispensable,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said with mock sadness.\nTrevor was caught in a trance; his entire body was rigid, as he drifted towards Rose. He knew that his body was changing forever, and that some of the light he could see reflected in her perfect violet eyes was coming from his body as the power of the mermaid milk built up within him. Below, he could feel Pat and Phoebe stroking his legs, legs he was about to lose permanently.\n\u0026ldquo;Be my pod-mate forever and give me my tail?\u0026rdquo; he said, barely able to get the words out.\n\u0026ldquo;Drink and receive your tail,\u0026rdquo; Rose said as she gathered her soon-tobe -pod-mate into her arms, guiding his rigid body towards her straining nipple. As soon as he made contact, she erupted into an intense orgasm, one breast spurting milk into the water and the other into his mouth. He didn\u0026rsquo;t notice Pat and Phoebe abandon his legs. He was only conscious of Rose and her breast as milk flowed from her into his mouth. They were locked in that embrace for several minutes before her spurting breasts subsided and Trevor drifted to the center of the pool.\nHe felt his arms rise in the water, stretching out to each side, feeling the power of the change sweep through his body. He could feel Rose\u0026rsquo;s ferocious attention directed at his body, amplified by the other mermaids and the pool itself. Her gaze seemed to burn through him, searing him with its intensity, and the sound of the humming pressed on his body and on his mind like a heavy blanket. After a few moments, a great throbbing wave passed through his rigid body, and he felt the change begin. His bones were breaking, moving, changing, and reforming themselves into a merman\u0026rsquo;s tail. Time seemed meaningless as wave after wave of convulsions swept through him, and he was barely aware of his body starting to spin. He felt muscles grow, twisting up from his tail, snaking up along his spine, anchoring themselves along his pelvis and backbone. His skin tingled as waves of pleasure throbbed outward from his newly repositioned groin, and he felt fins and flukes push out from his hips, knees, feet, and elbows. Finally, a great wave of release shook through him, causing his new red and black-stripped tail to quiver above his head. Gold fringes, he thought to himself as his body relaxed in the water. I have gold fringes on my flukes.\n\u0026ldquo;Trevor,\u0026rdquo; Rose called out to him, and he turned towards her. \u0026ldquo;Take me,\u0026rdquo; she said simply, as she had the night before.\nHe pushed himself towards his new mate, and he barely noticed the other mermen and Petra and Liga dive back into the pool. He had eyes only for Rose who beckoned to him. He didn\u0026rsquo;t notice Michelle and Mari snuggle along their mother\u0026rsquo;s backs while their parents pressed their fronts together. He pulled on his vent and freed his now expanded cock into the water. He barely noticed that Rose entwined their tails together, and grabbed his cock, he was so entranced with her eyes. Her lips met his at the same time as she pressed herself home onto his cock, their eyes locked on one another\u0026rsquo;s.\nTrevor would never be able to tell anyone how long he and Rose remained locked together. He only remembered her eyes, and the long, throbbing orgasms that they both experienced, again and again. There was no need for recovery, as his new body responded to the desires Rose ignited, again and again. Long after the other mers had satisfied the passions created by the transformations and had left the Moon Pool, they remained hidden behind a cloud of white, while flashing red and gold lights illuminated the cloud from within. Hours later, after night had fallen and the mers had returned, both Trevor and Rose agreed that everyone was right; sex was better as a mer.\nThree days later, Trevor and Rose finally agreed to separate themselves long enough so that MuSu could teach him the mer\u0026rsquo;s version of underwater martial arts, and Pat and Phoebe could teach Rose about edible and safe marine flora and fauna.\nSandy Halbst looked over at his wife of ten years, watching the sea breezes toss her short blond hair. It was finally growing back after she had lost it during chemotherapy. Unfortunately, her ovarian cancer was returning too. Rather than spend the last weeks of her life in a hospital, they had jumped at the chance to help Hank and Janice Connors search for her in-law who had gone off on a Greenpeace mission. It would be one last beautiful trip together before the end.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not supposed to be thinking what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking,\u0026rdquo; Dawn Halbst teased her husband, her green eyes dancing in the sunlight.\n\u0026ldquo;Who said I was thinking anything?\u0026rdquo; he challenged. \u0026ldquo;I was just thinking how pretty your hair is in a pixie cut.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ha!\u0026rdquo; she laughed. \u0026ldquo;You and I both know that you preferred it long.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So did you,\u0026rdquo; he protested.\n\u0026ldquo;Hug me,\u0026rdquo; she said impulsively.\nSandy gathered his wife into his arms, and gently held her. They had first met in college, but it was not love at first sight. Sandy was short and thin for a guy; actually, he was a first class geek, whereas Dawn was a cheerleader, popular and stunningly beautiful. She was the classic five foot two, one hundred and two (lbs), and eyes of green, blond bombshell; and to the degree that cancer had weakened her body, she still was very attractive. He was only five foot six inches (167 cm), and a bespectacled geek. They had been \u0026ldquo;just friends,\u0026rdquo; until Dawn had been dumped yet again by another jock-type boyfriend, and after a drunken evening of mutual solace, they had discovered themselves in bed together. Dawn discovered that she actually enjoyed Sandy\u0026rsquo;s soft, slow, and tender style of lovemaking, and they had become a couple. Once Sandy got his \u0026ldquo;sex legs,\u0026rdquo; Dawn discovered that Sandy\u0026rsquo;s imagination and persistence lifted her to heights of love and pleasure she had never dreamed possible. After college, they were married.\nLife had been kind to them, at first. Both worked in the computer industry, Sandy as a programmer and Dawn in marketing. After a few years, Hank Connors recruited Dawn to work for his new dot.com startup, and Sandy was just a trailing spouse that Hank hired reluctantly. After his first year, however, Sandy had three software patents and both the Halbsts and the Connors were reaping the benefits of his inventions. Now that material success was meaningless, Sandy was determined to make every minute with his wife count.\n\u0026ldquo;I would do anything to—\u0026rdquo; he began.\n\u0026ldquo;Shush,\u0026rdquo; she said, hugging him tightly. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve said it a thousand times.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like to say it a million more,\u0026rdquo; he said, some sadness creeping into his voice.\n\u0026ldquo;O.K., then,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;d better get started, because I don\u0026rsquo;t have much time.\u0026rdquo;\nSandy grimaced at her frankness, and wondered yet again how this woman got her strength.\n\u0026ldquo;I love you,\u0026rdquo; he said after a moment.\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;I love you too. Remember, you promised.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; he said, emotion choking his voice. \u0026ldquo;But you made me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No moping after I\u0026rsquo;m gone,\u0026rdquo; she said with determination.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re the only one that I want to—\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey! You promised,\u0026rdquo; she insisted. \u0026ldquo;You will remarry. You\u0026rsquo;re rich, young, and deserve to have someone love you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about good looking?\u0026rdquo; he teased, trying to recover his emotional center.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s only been a recent development,\u0026rdquo; she teased, happy to have distracted him from his sadness over her impending death. \u0026ldquo;You were a super geek until you turned thirty.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why did you ever marry me?\u0026rdquo; he asked, laughing now.\n\u0026ldquo;Because I learned that love is on the inside, not the outside,\u0026rdquo; she sighed, remembering.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey you two,\u0026rdquo; a voice said from the stern of the Sea Dancer, \u0026ldquo;get a room.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Eve you\u0026rsquo;re just jealous,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said. \u0026ldquo;Besides, there is only one private room on this boat, and Bill and Mae are using it.\u0026rdquo;\nEve Smith, Mae Williams' younger sister and Dawn\u0026rsquo;s best friend from college, laughed as she watched her former roommate smile over her husband\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. She was also a blond, blue-eyed cheerleader type, though much taller than Dawn, and she and Dawn had double dated many times. She was also glad that Dawn had found Sandy, someone who truly loved her for her spirit rather than her beauty. Such a true love had never happened for Eve, despite her fun and playful personality and cheerleader good looks.\n\u0026ldquo;Sandy, you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be sailing this thing,\u0026rdquo; Eve quipped as she rose from the galley, looking at the island off their starboard bow. \u0026ldquo;Bill and Mae are \u0026hellip; um \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Indisposed, I know,\u0026rdquo; Sandy said laughing. He released Dawn from his embrace and put his hands back on the wheel of the boat. \u0026ldquo;Tell them we should make landfall on 399 in an hour, maybe sooner if this wind holds up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll wait until they stop making soft groaning noises, as though we can\u0026rsquo;t hear them,\u0026rdquo; Eve said, her eyes laughing as she looked down into the galley.\n\u0026ldquo;We heard all that!\u0026rdquo; a voice drifted up from below.\n\u0026ldquo;Well then, finish up and get ready to rescue the out-law in-law,\u0026rdquo; Dawn shouted down the hatch.\n\u0026ldquo;Where are John and Patrick?\u0026rdquo; asked Dawn rhetorically. \u0026ldquo;There are beach huts here that someone keeps in good repair, but their boat is gone.\u0026rdquo;\nBill scanned the beach, pushing his red hair back underneath the widebrimmed hat that he wore to protect his fair skin from the sun. He narrowed his eyes as he scanned the mountain before him, his barrel chest and stout legs spread out like two tree trunks. He looked like a mythic old sea captain, with several weeks of growth on his face, the dark red hair tight and curly. His wife leaned on his arm as he scanned the jungle. They had been on the island for over an hour, and they had found no sign of the two men.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t think something happened to them since Trevor last radioed us?\u0026rdquo; Dawn worried.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t see any signs of a struggle,\u0026rdquo; Bill offered as he searched the jungle and nearby sand. \u0026ldquo;What do you think, Mae?\u0026rdquo;\nMae Williams gazed again at the sea, and then swept her eyes along the rising edge of the volcano, judging its size. She and Eve were nearly the same height, though there was a ten-year difference in their ages. Like her husband, she was sturdy where Eve was more willowy, and you could see the inner strength of the woman in her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe they are on the other side of the island,\u0026rdquo; she offered. \u0026ldquo;We can get back in the boat and check. It would only take about three hours to sail around this small island.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But that would be a waste of time,\u0026rdquo; a voice said from the water.\nAll five humans who had been looking at the island rising up around them turned around to look at the water, and all of them gasped audibly. There were eighteen colorful mermaids and mermen arranged in a semi-circle in the shallow water just off the beach, their torsos rising above the small swells while their colorful tails splashed in the shallow water behind them. Two of the mermaids held smaller mermaids in their arms. Some appeared Asian, some Filipino, and some Caucasian. Mermaids outnumbered the mermen nearly three to one. They were all stunningly beautiful and handsome.\n\u0026ldquo;We can generally do it in under fifteen minutes,\u0026rdquo; said the merman who looked surprisingly like a younger version of John.\n\u0026ldquo;Do what?\u0026rdquo; Bill asked, stunned at the sight before him.\n\u0026ldquo;Swim around the island, silly,\u0026rdquo; one of the three identical mermaids near John giggled.\n\u0026ldquo;Bill, don\u0026rsquo;t you recognize me?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Um \u0026hellip; not really,\u0026rdquo; Bill said, trying to find his footing.\n\u0026ldquo;Sandy, Dawn?\u0026rdquo; John continued.\n\u0026ldquo;You look like the John I remember from ten years ago,\u0026rdquo; Sandy began. \u0026ldquo;But he wasn\u0026rsquo;t a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Merman, actually,\u0026rdquo; John said smiling. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a good story. Would you like to hear about it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I think so,\u0026rdquo; Sandy said, beginning to think that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t hallucinating, and that what was happening was real.\n\u0026ldquo;By the way,\u0026rdquo; John said putting his arm around a beautiful mermaid next to him, her red hair cascading down her shoulders, and her sea-green tail sparkling in the sunlight, her belly swollen in pregnacy. \u0026ldquo;This is Patrick, remember him?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said, suddenly sitting down on the sand, feeling the earth sway beneath her feet. \u0026ldquo;This WILL be a good story.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re getting better at telling this story,\u0026rdquo; Danni observed as the evening sunset danced along the distant clouds over the western arm of the lagoon. \u0026ldquo;The last time it was completely dark by the time you finished.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The last time?\u0026rdquo; Bill asked, still absorbing all the information that the mers had given him in the last four hours.\n\u0026ldquo;Hank and Janice,\u0026rdquo; Pat reminded him.\n\u0026ldquo;And you were Robbie, Hank\u0026rsquo;s son?\u0026rdquo; asked Sandy incredulously.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Rose now,\u0026rdquo; she said blushing.\n\u0026ldquo;This is all so incredible,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, it is,\u0026rdquo; Bill agreed. \u0026ldquo;Now I can see why Hank wanted us to come see for our selves. Frankly, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would have believed him over the radio.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They plan on returning and joining us as soon as they tie up a few loose ends,\u0026rdquo; John said.\n\u0026ldquo;The whole family?\u0026rdquo; Sandy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, along with some other key people,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued. \u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t tell you more yet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why not?\u0026rdquo; asked Mae.\n\u0026ldquo;Because, my darling,\u0026rdquo; Bill answered. \u0026ldquo;They do not know if we will leave or join them yet. If we leave, then it is best if we don\u0026rsquo;t know some things. If we stay and join them, it will be necessary for us to know. Am I right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Couldn\u0026rsquo;t have put it better,\u0026rdquo; John agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then, it\u0026rsquo;s past dinner time, and we have some decisions to make,\u0026rdquo; Bill concluded. \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you guys go eat, and we\u0026rsquo;ll unload the boat and have a bite ourselves. We can talk more tomorrow morning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It will be quicker if we help you,\u0026rdquo; Trevor offered. \u0026ldquo;We can ferry the stuff while some of you man the boat and others the beach.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We can help too,\u0026rdquo; Emma offered.\n\u0026ldquo;Emma!\u0026rdquo; Cleo squealed in protest.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, be quiet,\u0026rdquo; Rikki chided. \u0026ldquo;And NO, you are not going first with MuSu tonight.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But it is her turn,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said with a small smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, well then, in that case, she loses her turn if she complains,\u0026rdquo; Emma said sweetly. MuSu nodded in agreement.\nCleo pouted at MuSu, but he was unmoved. Then she glared at her sisters but didn\u0026rsquo;t say anything. In fact, she was extra well behaved and made more trips than anyone else, continuing to work as the stars began to twinkle, retrieving Dawn\u0026rsquo;s medicine from the boat to help her sleep through her pain.\nTuri handed the tiller over to his cousin, Tiki, a smaller Polynesian man who gripped it and glanced down at the compass at his feet.\n\u0026ldquo;We keep this heading until tomorrow morning?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Turi answered.\n\u0026ldquo;What are we looking for?\u0026rdquo; Tiki asked for the umpteenth time.\n\u0026ldquo;People you do not know,\u0026rdquo; Turi answered, feeling jumpy. Turi had been a petty thief until Manalo had hired him as a drug runner, and now he owed his life to Manalo. Sometimes he felt badly about dragging some of his family into \u0026ldquo;the business,\u0026rdquo; and so he tried to keep them as ignorant as possible. Rangi was Tiki\u0026rsquo;s best friend and Turi conscripted his boat for this mission. The final crewmember was Tuo Guo Han, a tall Chinese sailor that Manalo had insisted he bring along.\nTuri didn\u0026rsquo;t trust the larger Chinese man, who mostly kept to himself. English was the only common language among the four of them, and even Rangi didn\u0026rsquo;t speak the same Tongic dialect as Turi did. Tiki was a bookworm as a child, and spoke several Polynesian dialects, but not Chinese. None of them spoke English well, but it would suffice.\nThe South Pacific was a big place, and it took days for boats to sail from one island to the next, sometimes several weeks. The sky stretched out in all directions like a purple blanket, littered with thousands of stars. Turi watched as Tiki gauged their position by the stars, a talent their ancestors had perfected. He hoped that his plans would not bring bad luck to Tiki, who he liked, but who would serve his purpose. His purpose was money. Manalo wouldn\u0026rsquo;t tell him why they were searching for a man named Alberto and his gang, but Manalo\u0026rsquo;s secretary accidentally let slip that Alberto had a lot of stolen money. A whole lot of money!\nTuri wasn\u0026rsquo;t a bad man, but he was a greedy man. He was sure that Manalo didn\u0026rsquo;t suspect that Miss Chin had made the mistake, but it was one he hoped to capitalize upon. Manalo expected only a radio dispatch when Alberto was found, but Turi made new plans. He watched Tiki as his cousin made adjustments to their course, keeping them heading for the small island Turi suspected harbored Alberto and his men. Turi fingered the gun strapped to his leg. They would be in the area tomorrow, and if they moved quickly, he would steal the money, and then disappear himself into the South Pacific archipelago, a rich man.\n\u0026ldquo;These men are bad men?\u0026rdquo; Tiki asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we will gain much honor in ridding the world of them,\u0026rdquo; Turi answered.\nHe wondered again, at the wisdom of lying to his cousins. If Tiki and Rangi discovered that Turi\u0026rsquo;s primary purpose was the money, they might back out. They thought they were rescuing fellow islanders who had been kidnapped by Alberto. After they disposed of Alberto and his men, Turi planned on \u0026ldquo;discovering\u0026rdquo; the money. He had no idea what his cousins would think of the money, or if they would help him kill Manalo\u0026rsquo;s spy, Tuo.\nPhoebe looked up at Danni\u0026rsquo;s face, watching her as her fifth orgasm rolled through her body.\n\u0026ldquo;Enough,\u0026rdquo; Danni gasped, holding her stomach as she tried to contain the convulsions that rolled through her abdomen. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll go into labor if you do any more.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No you won\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Orgasms do not trigger labor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s now or never, the bet was ten.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t I bank them?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked, struggling to control her quivering body, the water around her misted with her own milk.\n\u0026ldquo;Nope,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;Use them or lose them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How about you do Pat and then come back to me?\u0026rdquo; she suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;The bet was ten \u0026hellip; unrequited and uninterrupted,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe teased, moving her fingers yet again inside Danni\u0026rsquo;s vent, flicking her thumb across her swollen clit.\n\u0026ldquo;Then \u0026hellip; go \u0026hellip; ahead \u0026hellip; and \u0026hellip; do \u0026hellip; meeeeeeeeeee,\u0026rdquo; Danni squealed as another wave of pleasure washed through her body.\n\u0026ldquo;You better make sure you have enough energy left for me,\u0026rdquo; Pat warned Phoebe as she jealously watched Danni thrash through her sixth orgasm.\n\u0026ldquo;She better make sure she has enough energy left for me,\u0026rdquo; John said, smiling wickedly.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait a minute,\u0026rdquo; Pat protested as she watched Danni reach yet another plateau of pleasure. \u0026ldquo;What about unrequited do you not understand?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;From either of you,\u0026rdquo; John said smiling. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t take the bet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Cheater,\u0026rdquo; Danni gasped, her chest heaving.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, shoving her arm up into Danni all the way up to her elbow fin. \u0026ldquo;I believe this will be number eight,\u0026rdquo; she said as she twisted her fist deep within Danni\u0026rsquo;s still pulsing vagina.\nDanni was twitching and mumbling incoherently by the time Phoebe was done with her. Phoebe then brought Pat to a similar state of delirium, while John watched nearby. After Danni collected the nearly unconscious Pat into her arms, Phoebe attacked John with a ferocity he had never seen from her before. An hour later, when all the milk had settled, Phoebe looked over the wreckage she had wrought upon her podmates.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m up for another bet,\u0026rdquo; she said perkily. \u0026ldquo;Any takers?\u0026rdquo;\nThe next morning, the mers radioed Hank and Janice from Bill\u0026rsquo;s boat. Yes, they were all fine, and yes, they had discovered the \u0026ldquo;new species of marine mammals\u0026rdquo; on the island—the code Pat and John had agreed to with Hank and Janice, rather than chance some eavesdropper on the short wave radio hear \u0026ldquo;mermaid\u0026rdquo; over the airwaves. Hank told them that their \u0026ldquo;plans\u0026rdquo; were proceeding smoothly, and that they would return in a month or two, depending on the timing of some business deals. Janice asked Bill if they planned on \u0026ldquo;staying,\u0026rdquo; and Bill reported that it looked possible, but that there were still some questions to be answered. They told them that \u0026ldquo;Rose\u0026rdquo; and Trevor were fine, having made the change, and there was silence on the other end for a few seconds. Janice finally said something about winning a bet, and everyone signed off.\nWhen they reassembled on the beach, Bill, Mae, and Eve were genuinely intrigued about the possibilities of becoming mers, but they weren\u0026rsquo;t rushing into any decision. Sandy, on the other hand, was desperate to have Dawn and himself make the transition. Dawn, however, was strangely reluctant.\n\u0026ldquo;It would mean that you would have to give up everything,\u0026rdquo; Dawn pleaded. \u0026ldquo;Your work, your inventions, everything that you\u0026rsquo;ve worked for your entire life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, you are the only thing I refuse to give up,\u0026rdquo; Sandy said firmly. \u0026ldquo;If it meant that I could save your life, I will happily become a mer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we don\u0026rsquo;t know if it will work,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said. \u0026ldquo;The siren cell cures cuts, not cancer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But Pat, Alexis and Galina think it is worth a shot,\u0026rdquo; Eve argued.\n\u0026ldquo;But we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be human anymore,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said fearfully.\n\u0026ldquo;Says who?\u0026rdquo; Sandy asked. \u0026ldquo;Do John or Pat seem any less human to you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I hardly knew them before,\u0026rdquo; Dawn protested. \u0026ldquo;How could I compare?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Dawn, what is the real problem?\u0026rdquo; Eve asked, putting her arm around her best friend. \u0026ldquo;This could not only save your life, but it could make your life last for hundreds of years.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you going to become a mermaid?\u0026rdquo; Dawn asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought I might join you and Sandy, if that was alright,\u0026rdquo; Eve said. \u0026ldquo;After all, there was that one night after the frat party that—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alright,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said, putting her hand over her friend\u0026rsquo;s mouth. \u0026ldquo;Enough. I am afraid. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a bad feeling that something that will go wrong.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We already know that you\u0026rsquo;re going to die if we do nothing,\u0026rdquo; Sandy argued. \u0026ldquo;I am ready to chance anything to have you healthy and with me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But it\u0026rsquo;s you I\u0026rsquo;m worried about; you\u0026rsquo;re the smallest man here,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said softly, finally sharing what was most worrying her. \u0026ldquo;Even Eve is taller than you. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to lose you as part of the price for becoming healthy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing will take me away from you,\u0026rdquo; Sandy reassured her.\n\u0026ldquo;What if the two of you take some mermaid milk up to the hot tub for a few days with nobody else around,\u0026rdquo; Eve suggested. \u0026ldquo;After you\u0026rsquo;re both halfway changed, and Dawn has focused her energies on making Sandy taller, then you can come back to the water and make the change into mers with me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said, thinking. \u0026ldquo;I hadn\u0026rsquo;t thought of that. Sandy, would that be alright with you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t care if you make me become a hulking he-man-mer,\u0026rdquo; he said, giddy with joy. \u0026ldquo;As long as I\u0026rsquo;m with you, I don\u0026rsquo;t care what I look like.\u0026rdquo;\nJoy Simpson angled her plane as she swept over the low atoll, its highest point barely a meter above sea level. The wave and wind swept sand was empty, and despite the teeming reefs that surrounded the small landmass, no human activity could be seen. She leveled her wings and continued south, following the grid she had mapped out earlier. The sleek turbojet made searching the Blackgate quadrant a snap, but it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t allow her to get very close or to land on these remote islands.\nWhen Mac first told her about the coincidence of the newly declared classified location and Sally\u0026rsquo;s last known heading, her heart leapt in her chest. Sally confessed to Joy her childhood fascination with the sea in general and mermaids in particular when she was eight years old. The strength of the young girl\u0026rsquo;s convictions that she would one day become a mermaid were imprinted on Joy\u0026rsquo;s memory so vividly that she knew Sally was behind the Blackgate protocol. But real mermaids? Even that was a stretch for a woman who had spent her life finding and keeping some amazing secrets.\nShe had been flying up and down the quadrant for most of the morning, and she was about to cross over the imaginary halfway point of the Blackgate area. She noticed a small island on the horizon, not an atoll, but an island dominated by a small volcano, now apparently dormant. She glanced at her map; 399, an as yet unnamed island in the Republic of Kiribati. Why had the island remained unnamed, she wondered? Moving at over 300 nautical miles per hour, she prepared to circle the island at 15,000 feet.\nHer sharp, well-trained eyes caught flashes of color scrambling off a southern beach and disappearing into the water, but she was too far away to see anything clearly. A few seconds later, she was over the island, slowing her speed, snapping hundreds of pictures with her highspeed /high-resolution camera. She began circling down to about 500 feet above the sea, until the tip of the small volcano was even with her wingtips. Whoever had been in the large lagoon along the southern edge of the island was no longer visible, though there were several huts along the edge of the beach where the sand met the jungle.\nSomeone was on that island, and there was a sailboat in the lagoon, but it did not match the old fishing boat that Sally and Eric bought in Suva. More to the point, there didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be any evidence that said \u0026ldquo;magic\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;terrorism,\u0026rdquo; and Joy wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure which term frightened her more. Sea Dancer, she noted in her log. She circled one last time, and pulled back to 15,000 feet, moving on to the next island on her map. Number 399 was a definite possibility, but she would need to return with either a seaplane or a boat. As she raced through the sky, she noted a storm approaching from the west and an islander fishing boat east of the island. In a few minutes, she was over the boat, and snapped a few shots, noting that it was headed towards the island. She swooped down for a closer look, and saw four men working nets. One of them, a Chinese man, waved at her as she swept by.\nThey didn\u0026rsquo;t look like the people who had made those huts, and she couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sure they were headed for the island. They were still at least 12 hours away, and even now, as she watched, the boat circled to the north. The storm would be in this area soon, and that was probably why the boat was turning around. She noted its position in her log, and resumed her sweep of the area.\nWhat ever Sally had done, it was a doozy. Poor Mac, she thought to herself, his position was far too public, and the thought that Sally might be doing something that reflected badly on his reputation gnawed at him. It had been one of the reasons why she and Mac had never consummated any kind of relationship; her work with the CIA was a potential liability for a Navy career man, especially one who aspired to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nIn any event, she would return in a few days, probably on a seaplane. She first needed to surreptitiously arrange all the logistical necessities, and then she could check out 399 for herself. She felt she owed at least that to Mac, and to his daughter.\n\u0026ldquo;That was a close one,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, as she watched the plane disappear into the distance.\n\u0026ldquo;It was not a military plane,\u0026rdquo; Sally offered, bobbing to the surface next to her.\n\u0026ldquo;How can you tell?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked.\n\u0026ldquo;All military aircraft are required by international law to have national markings on their aircraft,\u0026rdquo; Sally explained. \u0026ldquo;That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the plane isn\u0026rsquo;t connected to some other governmental agency, just that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a Navy or Air force plane.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You could see the plane that well from underwater?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, it\u0026rsquo;s great being a mermaid, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo; Sally smiled.\n\u0026ldquo;So, what are we going to do?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s wait for about twenty minutes, to make sure the plane isn\u0026rsquo;t returning, and then get back to the beach to meet with Sandy and Dawn,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Is that about right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Sally nodded. \u0026ldquo;If the pilot is linked to me, it will take a few more hours to finish the Blackgate quadrant. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t return until later tonight or tomorrow morning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think that Dawn should wait another day before beginning her treatment to see if we can cure her cancer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;These eight bottles should last you until tomorrow afternoon,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained to Dawn and Sandy. \u0026ldquo;You should finish these two first, and see how it goes from there. If you can feel the cancer going away, then it\u0026rsquo;s safe to have more.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why are we waiting between doses?\u0026rdquo; Sandy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Because, if the mermaid milk works, you two can continue to be alone, and focus on making you her mate,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;But if the cancer isn\u0026rsquo;t being cured, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t drink any more, or you risk Sandy not being able to remain a man.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I will be fine,\u0026rdquo; Sandy said to her. \u0026ldquo;Eve has already volunteered to be restrained, if necessary, so that I can still physically dominate her. The only bad thing that can happen is that the mermaid milk doesn\u0026rsquo;t cure cancer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You should still wait until we have all those circumstances set up,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;Once you build up enough of the siren cells in your body, you become vulnerable to outside influences or even those within your own imagination.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How can we tell that her cancer is being cured?\u0026rdquo; Sandy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Healing is usually accompanied by feelings of pain, mostly mild, because any time cells regenerate, our nerves send signals to our brain that are very similar to the ones for pain.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, if after I start drinking the milk,\u0026rdquo; Dawn asked, \u0026ldquo;I start to feel pain, that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat reassured her.\n\u0026ldquo;And if I don\u0026rsquo;t?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The siren cell isn\u0026rsquo;t recognizing the cancer as a wound or invasive,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Cancer cells are still your own cells, after all. We have no idea if the siren cell can tell the difference.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And so Sandy shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any more milk until we get Eve ready to help him?\u0026rdquo; Dawn asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;But we can worry about that tomorrow morning, because you will know as soon as you have your first dose.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, at least Sandy would be fulfilling his promise,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said, with a sad smile.\n\u0026ldquo;What promise is that?\u0026rdquo; Eve asked.\n\u0026ldquo;He would become your mate,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said, stroking her best friend\u0026rsquo;s cheek. \u0026ldquo;I made him promise that he would remarry when I died. Becoming your merman-pod-mate would fulfill that promise.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;All of that is nonsense,\u0026rdquo; Eve said brusquely. \u0026ldquo;You will be fine, and we will both become his pod-mates. Now, off with you two, and don\u0026rsquo;t come back until you\u0026rsquo;re cured.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t forget there will be a big storm tonight, so stay close to the huts,\u0026rdquo; Pat warned them.\n\u0026ldquo;How can you tell?\u0026rdquo; Sandy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Mer-senses,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;Storms have enormous electrical discharges, and we can usually sense them when they are a few hours away, depending on how big they are.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How big will this one be?\u0026rdquo; Dawn asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Hard to tell,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;If it is here in an hour, it\u0026rsquo;s a relatively small one. The longer it takes, the bigger it is.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, if we don\u0026rsquo;t see a storm before we fall asleep, it will be a big one?\u0026rdquo; Dawn asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed, looking at the early afternoon sun, still bright and warm in the western sky. \u0026ldquo;We should all hunker down if the storm isn\u0026rsquo;t here by darkness.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about our boat?\u0026rdquo; Mae asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Is everything harvested from it?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Bill answered. \u0026ldquo;The radio is in the lab cave now, and the antennae is tied to the gun\u0026rsquo;s cabling. Gabriel and Galina tested it this morning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you\u0026rsquo;re staying?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Bill nodded. \u0026ldquo;Regardless of what happens with Dawn and Sandy, Mae and I will start a new pod.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then why don\u0026rsquo;t we tow the boat out into the storm, and let the sea take care of it,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;You and Mae can come back to the caves tonight and get started, if you want.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about Eve?\u0026rdquo; Dawn asked. \u0026ldquo;She can\u0026rsquo;t stay on the beach all by herself, and she can\u0026rsquo;t come up to the mountainside huts because \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll go back to the caves too,\u0026rdquo; Eve suggested, knowing how worried Dawn was. \u0026ldquo;I will wait to start my transformation until after we find out what happens with your cancer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;O.K., I guess we should get started,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said, holding her hand out for her husband.\nThe mers and Bill, Mae, and Eve watched as Dawn and Sandy walked into the jungle, headed for the mountainside camp. After they disappeared into the jungle, Bill turned to his wife.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you ready to become a mermaid?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m ready to become your mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Mae said, smiling.\nAfter they reached the mountainside huts, Sandy and Dawn looked out at the island below them. They could see Bill\u0026rsquo;s boat being slowly towed out to the west, but they couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any storm clouds on the horizon yet. Bill, Mae, and Eve used the boat one last time to sail over to the entrance to the western caves, and then the mers helped them reach the Moon Pool by breathing for them. Bill and Mae would start their first feeding, and they could transition the next day. Everyone had agreed not to return to the beach to give Dawn as much time as possible to help Sandy\u0026rsquo;s change into a larger man before Eve was brought into the picture.\nDawn looked at the food they had stockpiled to help Sandy grow bigger. The mers explained that the siren cell would change them quite a bit, but depending on how big Dawn hoped Sandy might become, they risked his health if his body were forced to cannibalize itself too much. The siren cell made their mer bodies incredibly efficient at using and storing food energy, but it could not create something from nothing. Sandy had already eaten as much as he could stand.\n\u0026ldquo;You ready?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; he answered, holding out their first doses.\nShe took the plastic bottle filled with the milky white substance, and began to drink. The first few gulps went down easily, an unexpected sweetness filling her senses. She finished the dose and looked at her husband as he finished his. She was filled yet again with a deep affection for this man. His blue eyes sparkled and his pale blond hair fell across his forehead. He was only a few inches taller than she was, but he had been a tower of stability, love, and hope in her life.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you feel anything yet?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, not yet,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;I feel a warmth in my belly, but it will probably take a few minutes before the milk reaches my intestines and from there into my bloodstream, and finally to where the cancer is.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I love you,\u0026rdquo; he said, and stroked her blond hair away from her green eyes. \u0026ldquo;And you can make me into anything you like, even like Jason.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you still jealous over that meathead/jock?\u0026rdquo; she teased. \u0026ldquo;You have to remember that I married you, not him.\u0026rdquo;\nJason was her last boyfriend before she and Sandy had started dating. He was a lacrosse player, about six foot two inches tall (190 cm). In fact, all of Dawn\u0026rsquo;s boyfriends had been big men, usually jocks, the exact opposite of Sandy.\n\u0026ldquo;And, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to turn you into any kind of jock,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;I love you just the way you are, but we can make you taller than Eve at least.\u0026rdquo;\nSandy smiled as he looked at his wife, still beautiful despite the disease that had ravaged her body. They sat together for many minutes, just content to be with each other. Suddenly, Dawn doubled over in pain, moaning. She fell to the ground, clutching her lower abdomen.\n\u0026ldquo;Does it hurt?\u0026rdquo; he asked hopefully.\nDawn writhed on the ground, feeling great waves of pain roll through her womb. It felt like the worst cramps possible, like a million tiny explosions of pain in her guts, a relentless throbbing of agony. Despite the pain that vibrated through her, she raised her head to her husband, and looked up at him through tears of joy mixed with tears of pain.\n\u0026ldquo;It hurts \u0026hellip; so much,\u0026rdquo; she gasped. \u0026ldquo;It hurts \u0026hellip; so good.\u0026rdquo;\nThe storm lashed the boat as Turi struggled to make anchor in the lee of the island. Lightening raced across the sky, illuminating the dark rows of rocks that stretched like teeth across the eastern shore of the island. They were only a few meters from one of the sandy beaches when suddenly the boat came to a grinding halt, screeching across a large rock that ripped through the boat.\n\u0026ldquo;Make for beach,\u0026rdquo; Turi ordered as he headed for the side of the boat. \u0026ldquo;Water deep, walk to beach,\u0026rdquo; he shouted, and leapt over the side.\nHe was loaded down with guns, ammo, and supplies. They had spotted the storm about two hours ago, in the middle of the night, and they raced for the island, hoping to make landfall before it struck. Each man was loaded down with supplies, and as they approached the island, they had abandoned their life jackets in favor of more supplies, confident that they could wade ashore.\nTuri found himself under water, the waves crashing on rocks above his head. He started for the shallower water, ready to hold his breath for a few minutes, but fingering the release that would deposit his pack on the ocean floor and allow him to float to the surface, an old islander trick. He made it to the shelter of the cove easily, and turned to watch as the other three men also made it ashore.\n\u0026ldquo;Off beach and find shelter in jungle,\u0026rdquo; he shouted above the noise of the storm.\nThe three other men nodded, and they all struggled up the cliff that sheltered this small beach. As soon as they poked their faces above the rim of the rocks, wind and rain lashed down on them. They all stumbled into the jungle, and Turi signaled for another stop.\n\u0026ldquo;Storm cover,\u0026rdquo; he shouted as the storm raged. \u0026ldquo;We go inland, keep guns ready if find Alberto. Leave supplies here,\u0026rdquo; he indicated a large tree with a hollow bowl on one side.\nThey loaded their supplies into the small hollow. Tiki and Rangi gingerly took the guns Turi handed to them, and then followed him into the jungle.\nEven though the mers had all fallen asleep earlier, the storm\u0026rsquo;s power woke everyone up. Eve was the first to awaken, the thunder echoing down the chimney. She stretched and looked around the cave by the light of the pale bioluminescence flickering from the pool below, a light that was augmented occasionally by lightening that flashed from above. Bill and Mae lay cuddled together, already looking younger from their first two feedings the previous evening, while the mers slowly rose up from the Moon Pool, pod by pod.\n\u0026ldquo;Now this is a storm,\u0026rdquo; Emma said appreciatively, looking at the sky through the chimney hole high above the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;Why did you guys wake up?\u0026rdquo; Eve asked. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t hear the storm underwater, can you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s more that the storm\u0026rsquo;s electrical fields make it hard to sleep,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s too much energy in the water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s sort of like being at a rock concert,\u0026rdquo; Rikki added. \u0026ldquo;Lots of lights and noise, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to make out individual words and songs.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that why you didn\u0026rsquo;t post a patrol tonight?\u0026rdquo; Bill asked, rising.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, there are limits to our mer-senses,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;We would only be able to sense someone approaching the island if they were practically on top of us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is a tactical issue we would need to solve,\u0026rdquo; Sally observed. \u0026ldquo;Someone could sneak up on us during a storm, and we would not be able to distinguish them among all the electrical noise.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my, are we in any danger?\u0026rdquo; Eve asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;We can still sense any intruders here, and even out to the main tunnel entrance. Normally we can sense large predators and boats in the water when they are still a ways off, several miles usually if the boat is big enough. During a storm, our range is much less.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, what should we do?\u0026rdquo; asked Danni. \u0026ldquo;We are all awake, and the storm has got Freya all riled up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Cynthia too,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe added. \u0026ldquo;How are you feeling Alexis?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m only six weeks pregnant.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mermaids don\u0026rsquo;t get morning sickness?\u0026rdquo; Mae asked, incredulous.\n\u0026ldquo;Not as far as we can tell,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said.\n\u0026ldquo;It barely feels like we are pregnant until the last two months,\u0026rdquo; Petra said. \u0026ldquo;The only way we can tell for sure is that our electrical signals change.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, why don\u0026rsquo;t we give Bill and Mae a third feeding so that they can make the transition earlier,\u0026rdquo; Pat suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;We can do that?\u0026rdquo; Bill asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;We are still experimenting, of course, but it only takes three to four hours for the full effects of a single feeding to become apparent. You had two last night, and if you do a third now, you can start the transition with breakfast instead of lunch.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which would be good, because then we can check in with Dawn and Sandy after lunch, which should be enough time for Sandy\u0026rsquo;s changes to get locked in,\u0026rdquo; Eve said. \u0026ldquo;Which means I won\u0026rsquo;t be the only old lady left.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not an old lady,\u0026rdquo; Mae teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh yes I am,\u0026rdquo; Eve said. \u0026ldquo;You look twenty years younger, and prettier too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who\u0026rsquo;s turn is it to feed?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Ours!\u0026rdquo; the triplets shouted.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it can\u0026rsquo;t be all three of you,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;Pick two of you.\u0026rdquo;\nCleo and Rikki beat Emma out of the pool and gathered Bill and Mae into their embraces.\n\u0026ldquo;Not fair,\u0026rdquo; Emma pouted.\n\u0026ldquo;Life\u0026rsquo;s not always fair,\u0026rdquo; Bill said as he gave a wink to his wife, who was attached to Cleo\u0026rsquo;s breast watching him, and then lowered his own lips to Rikki\u0026rsquo;s stiff nipple. The warm mermaid milk gushed from her breast, and he heard Rikki moan.\n\u0026ldquo;Being a feeder is so cool,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said breathlessly.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Cleo agreed, cradling Mae\u0026rsquo;s head to her breast. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t wait until we have our own children.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I can,\u0026rdquo; Emma groused as she watched her sisters swoon as they fed Bill and Mae.\nMuSu smiled in his usual semi-detached and understated way. \u0026ldquo;I am always at your service,\u0026rdquo; he said without any hint of irony. \u0026ldquo;Do you wish to practice making children while they feed?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Practice only?\u0026rdquo; Emma said warily.\n\u0026ldquo;My flower, only you can determine when you become pregnant,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said, still smiling enigmatically.\n\u0026ldquo;Then let\u0026rsquo;s go!\u0026rdquo; Emma said, waddling towards the edge of the Moon Pool. \u0026ldquo;I always wanted to make love in a storm.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Stay on the western side,\u0026rdquo; Pat warned, floating in the pool, feeling her belly shift as Maureen kicked. \u0026ldquo;And don\u0026rsquo;t get closer than a few meters to the surface. This storm is a big one,\u0026rdquo; she finished as a particularly loud thunderclap echoed in the chamber.\n\u0026ldquo;Not fair,\u0026rdquo; Rikki cried.\n\u0026ldquo;Life\u0026rsquo;s not fair, remember,\u0026rdquo; Bill chided her as he held her breast in his hands. \u0026ldquo;Stop squirming, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to feed here.\u0026rdquo;\nFour of the eight doses of mermaid milk were on the table, untouched. Sandy could not reach them. His hands were tied behind his back, and legs were bound together. The typhoon still raged outside, and he could see the four men huddle over his wife on the other side of the hut. The fury that burned in his heart equaled the fury of the storm that lashed against the hut, the wind and rain roaring through the seemingly insubstantial bamboo hut. As his fury increased, so too did the pain in his wrists as he struggled against his bonds.\n\u0026ldquo;Let go of her,\u0026rdquo; he screamed in his now slightly deeper voice. His larger muscles bulged against the ropes. \u0026ldquo;Do anything you want to me, but leave her alone!\u0026rdquo;\nThe four men did not acknowledge him, but they finished tying up his wife, turned and left the hut, dashing to the other huts nearby.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you alright?\u0026rdquo; Sandy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said, holding back her tears.\n\u0026ldquo;What were they doing to you?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing, just tying me up,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Can you move?\u0026rdquo; he asked, still struggling against the bonds that held him.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, only my hands are tied together,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Can you come over to the bed?\u0026rdquo; he grunted, still trying to escape the ropes that held him.\n\u0026ldquo;I think so,\u0026rdquo; she said, and rose to her knees.\nSandy Halbst watched as his wife crawled over to the bed on her knees. Even in the darkness, he could see that her hair was long, again, and her body had filled back out, thanks to the second dose of mermaid milk they consumed after it was clear that the cancer was cured. When lightening flashed across the sky, he could see that she looked twentyfive again, but she had a bruise on her cheek from the struggle they had put up as the islander men tied them up. The men surprised them while they were sleeping, but the bump on Sandy\u0026rsquo;s temple was already receding as the mermaid milk did its work. Unfortunately, he had been unconscious while they tied him up.\nDawn struggled to reach her husband, who also looked twenty-five, but not the same twenty-five he looked seven years ago. He was now nearly five feet ten inches tall, and he weighed about 170 pounds, no longer the five foot six inch tall geek. But he was nearly mad with helplessness as he struggled against the ropes that bound him.\n\u0026ldquo;Stop,\u0026rdquo; she sobbed. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re wrists are bleeding! You\u0026rsquo;ll kill yourself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, I won\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; he growled. \u0026ldquo;There is too much mermaid milk in our veins. I heal as fast as I cut myself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, you\u0026rsquo;re bleeding. Let me try,\u0026rdquo; she urged. \u0026ldquo;Stop moving.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter a few tense moments of trying to untie the complicated knots on his hands, the men walked back into the hut.\n\u0026ldquo;Back,\u0026rdquo; Turi tersely ordered. \u0026ldquo;Move there,\u0026rdquo; he pointed to the other side of the hut.\nDawn didn\u0026rsquo;t move, but just glared at the men. Turi jerked his head at the other two islanders who reluctantly strode forward, gently picked her up, and carried her across the room. Sandy thrashed on the bed.\n\u0026ldquo;Leave her the fuck alone!\u0026rdquo; he screamed, falling onto the floor in his struggle.\n\u0026ldquo;You stop or she die,\u0026rdquo; Turi said quietly, pointing his gun at Dawn.\nSandy lay still, breathing heavily, wishing that his transformation into a stronger man was complete. He scanned the room, searching for something to change the balance of power in the room.\n\u0026ldquo;Where Alberto?\u0026rdquo; Turi asked both of them.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know any Alberto,\u0026rdquo; Sandy said. \u0026ldquo;We are alone here on this island.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How long?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;A few days,\u0026rdquo; Sandy answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Then who build this?\u0026rdquo; Turi asked, waving his hand around the room.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said.\n\u0026ldquo;You lie,\u0026rdquo; Turi said, moving the gun closer to Dawn. \u0026ldquo;Where Alberto?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s telling you the truth,\u0026rdquo; Sandy said, gritting his teeth. \u0026ldquo;Why won\u0026rsquo;t you believe us?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alberto no let these live,\u0026rdquo; Tuo said. \u0026ldquo;He gone or dead.\u0026rdquo;\nSandy examined the four men as the frequent lightening illuminated each. The islander that seemed in charge was a small man, only about five foot five, and the two others were even shorter. The Chinese man was tall, over six feet, and seemed to have a hidden strength to him. Perhaps the Chinaman would be an ally.\n\u0026ldquo;If dead, where money?\u0026rdquo; Turi shouted above the noise of the storm.\n\u0026ldquo;We search after,\u0026rdquo; Tuo suggested, indicating the storm outside. He noticed that Tiki and Rangi scowled at Turi\u0026rsquo;s greed.\n\u0026ldquo;We kill them if no money,\u0026rdquo; Turi shouted. \u0026ldquo;Where Alberto\u0026rsquo;s money?\u0026rdquo; he demanded, moving the gun closer to Dawn\u0026rsquo;s head.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about,\u0026rdquo; Sandy said, trying to remain calm. \u0026ldquo;We are Americans, and my wife has cancer. We came here to enjoy her last few months together,\u0026rdquo; he said, nearly bringing himself to tears.\nThe three islander men exchanged some tense words in Tongan that ended when Turi pointed his gun at his cousins. They both slowly handed their guns to him and sank to the floor, looking defeated.\nTuo looked closely at the two cousins, trying to gauge their actions. The four of them had just left the hut to argue about the \u0026ldquo;rescue\u0026rdquo; they were attempting. After two hours of searching in the roaring wind and rain, they had discovered these two Americans. There were more huts on the beach, but no sign of Alberto, and there were no signs of a large Filipino drug gang. Tiki and Rangi wanted to know why they were tying up these Westerners, who were clearly a young married couple who had escaped to this island. They knew that Alberto and his men were Filipino or Asian, with some Australians, but no Americans, and certainly not this woman. Turi argued that they knew where Alberto was, and thus the standoff in which they were now engaged.\n\u0026ldquo;Kill no good,\u0026rdquo; Tuo said, biding his time, keeping his hand on his holster. \u0026ldquo;Hostage useful.\u0026rdquo;\nTuo smiled at Tiki and Rangi. Even though they were family to Turi, he suspected that this part of the trip was a surprise to them. Tuo was not surprised; Shen Chin had warned him that Turi would try something. Tuo wasn\u0026rsquo;t worried, either; he was bigger, stronger, and quicker than any of them. He thought back to the day Shen Chin had found him, nearly dead, drunk on a street corner in Suva. She nursed him back to health, and offered him a path to regain his honor. He was to help her find out what happened to Alberto so that she could form a plan to rescue her sister and steal the money for herself. Tuo Guo Han would give his life to do as Shen Chin had asked. Only Alberto and his men would be killed, and Turi now, if necessary.\n\u0026ldquo;Useful?\u0026rdquo; Turi demanded, turning but keeping his gun on Dawn. He knew better than to aim his gun at Tuo, who could easily kill him, unlike his weaker cousins.\n\u0026ldquo;Hostage make money,\u0026rdquo; Tuo said calmly.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Turi said, pointing his gun at Sandy. \u0026ldquo;Much trouble. Tell me where money!\u0026rdquo;\nTuo\u0026rsquo;s hand motion was so quick that Dawn didn\u0026rsquo;t see him move. Turi\u0026rsquo;s hand was suddenly pointed at the ceiling, his wrist firmly in Tuo\u0026rsquo;s grasp.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Tuo said calmly. \u0026ldquo;Kill no good.\u0026rdquo;\nThe two men looked at each other fiercely for a few tense moments, then Turi relaxed in the Chinaman\u0026rsquo;s grip.\n\u0026ldquo;I only fisherman,\u0026rdquo; he said smiling. \u0026ldquo;No fighter. Try to feed family.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No kill,\u0026rdquo; Tuo repeated, unmoving.\n\u0026ldquo;No kill,\u0026rdquo; Turi agreed.\nTuri lowered his arm and made a show of putting away his gun. Internally, he seethed. How dare this man show him up in front of his family! He would get his revenge. He would find a way to surprise Tuo.\nJoy scrolled through the hundreds of photographs she had taken, looking for any clues as to why, or even if, Sally and Eric were on that island.\n\u0026ldquo;No, don\u0026rsquo;t send any of them to me, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a secure email account,\u0026rdquo; Mac said over the phone.\n\u0026ldquo;Secure from whom?\u0026rdquo; Joy teased, knowing the answer. Mac was frustrated because he could get a disposable cell phone to talk to Joy or other people he didn\u0026rsquo;t want the Navy to know about, but all electronic communication that he \u0026ldquo;officially\u0026rdquo; used was bugged. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll just have to trust my judgment.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I do, you know that,\u0026rdquo; Mac stammered. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just that it\u0026rsquo;s my daughter, for god\u0026rsquo;s sake.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know, Mac,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Settle down. The boat is registered to a Bill Williams in San Francisco, and while he has been associated with Green Peace in the past, he has never participated in any of the more outrageous acts against shipping or forestry that some of them have.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t ask how you got all that information so quickly,\u0026rdquo; Mac said humorously.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s because you already know,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;It looks safe, a remote place granted, but lots safer than other places I\u0026rsquo;ve had to drop in upon.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Take your satellite phone?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Not unless you don\u0026rsquo;t want to keep this investigation private,\u0026rdquo; she answered. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait until we both get back to more anonymous phone lines. Trust me Mac, I think I would sense something if Sally were in trouble or if this was something beyond a potentially embarrassing environmental statement by your headstrong daughter. I\u0026rsquo;ve checked with some folks, and Bill and Mae Williams are good people, not crazies. What ever they are doing there, it isn\u0026rsquo;t dangerous.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who have you checked with?\u0026rdquo; Mac demanded.\n\u0026ldquo;You know better than to ask me such things,\u0026rdquo; Joy chided him. \u0026ldquo;Now grow up, and relax. I\u0026rsquo;ll talk to you in a few days.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going back?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, the day after tomorrow, with a seaplane and a lot of questions,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;You think she\u0026rsquo;s there?\u0026rdquo; he asked again.\n\u0026ldquo;If she\u0026rsquo;s not on that island, I\u0026rsquo;ll buy you dinner in Paris,\u0026rdquo; she said softly. \u0026ldquo;With all the trimmings.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;All the trimmings?\u0026rdquo; he asked, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we\u0026rsquo;re both not getting any younger, and the trimmings are not what they used to be,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;re about the only person in my life I still care about, and if our long delayed but never consummated evening in Paris can show you that, then that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ll do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How about we do Paris first, and then you find my daughter?\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll tell her that you said that when I see her in two days,\u0026rdquo; she said, laughing as she hung up the phone.\nEmma watched as the water roiled above them, the storm unleashing its fury upon the water. She could feel the incredible power of the storm with her mer-senses, and the water around her seemed to crackle with energy. She stretched out her body, feeling the water around her, as she drifted slowly two meters below the surface, pushing herself gently with her flukes. Her arms were spread out, her chest was thrust forward, and her tail curled in a semi-circle behind her. She let herself be carried by the water, and she felt the force and power of the storm pass safely over her.\nBelow her, MuSu swam lazily on his back, watching his mate trying to absorb the power of the storm, watching her beautiful body move through the dark water, her tail, flukes, and fins glowing with the familiar blue and white flashes of arousal. He pushed himself up towards her, pulling on his vent to free his stiff cock, letting it poke into the water as he swam towards Emma.\nEmma smiled down at him, and for a brief instant, MuSu could see Martin\u0026rsquo;s gentle spirit within her flashing blue eyes. His heart clutched as he remembered Martin\u0026rsquo;s kindness when he was Mai Lin, and (she) thought that Alberto had finally hurt her enough to kill her. Emma too sensed something different, a glow in MuSu\u0026rsquo;s eyes that was more than his usual glow.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you remember the night we were rescued?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked, bringing her hands back to her body. \u0026ldquo;Neither one of us looked like this,\u0026rdquo; she said, cradling her breasts in her hands as she pushed herself through the water.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; MuSu agreed, his own tail flashing with yellow lights as he brought himself close to his pod-mate. \u0026ldquo;But you were always special to me, Martin or Emma.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And now we are together with my sisters,\u0026rdquo; she said, feeling both the power of the storm above and the rising passion from MuSu below.\n\u0026ldquo;When will we make children?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Soon,\u0026rdquo; Emma whispered, twisting her body through the water, making MuSu keep up with her as they swam calmly under the raging sea. \u0026ldquo;I thought we were going to just practice,\u0026rdquo; she teased, still keeping her body moving through the water as she tugged on her own breasts, feeling them grow heavy with her arousal.\n\u0026ldquo;If you stop, we can—\u0026rdquo; MuSu said with a tinge of frustration, as he angled his cock towards her vent but missed.\n\u0026ldquo;Dolphins do it moving, so can we,\u0026rdquo; Emma said, adding a side-to-side motion with her hips as her tail still moved up and down, meandering through the strangely quite water, even as the storm tossed the waves above back and forth above them.\nMuSu smiled, understanding her game. He put more effort into swimming, and began to corkscrew around her body, brushing her with his cock, fins, and fingers as he twirled around her slowly undulating body. Emma gasped in pleasure as MuSu grazed her body, her breasts, and her tail with his. Her vent pulsed with need, filling with blood, opening itself to the sea, but she kept swimming forward, making a large arc back towards the cliff face, where the waves crashed against the island.\nMuSu gave a strong and well-timed stroke with his tail, and sank his cock into Emma\u0026rsquo;s exposed vent. He doubled his efforts, pulling her along by the force of their union, her body being pushed forward by his strong tail strokes, linking them together with his cock now firmly embedded within her. Emma moaned in appreciation, savoring the feelings of MuSu\u0026rsquo;s body pressed to her own even as they both built up speed, each trying to tease the other. She stopped swimming herself, and focused on wrapping her body around her lover\u0026rsquo;s as he swam through the water. She pressed her breasts against his chest, and nuzzled her lips into his neck. She let her tail flutter below his, caressing his lower tail with her flukes, her pelvic fins beating against his, responding to the rhythmic motions of MuSu\u0026rsquo;s swimming.\nMuSu was a strong swimmer, and the pressure of his cock on her clitoris was too much for Emma to ignore. On their third lap past the face of the cliffs, Emma dissolved into a massive orgasm in which she lost all control of her tail and torso, and she was propelled forward in the water solely by MuSu\u0026rsquo;s cock, throbbing within her. She buried her head in MuSu\u0026rsquo;s chest, and hung on as her body convulsed around his stiff penis. It was one of the best orgasms she had since becoming a mermaid, and it was better than any fantasy Martin ever dreamed about.\nWhen they came to a stop, near the entrance to the cave, Rikki and Cleo were waiting for them.\n\u0026ldquo;What ever that was, we want a piece of that,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said, nearly panting.\n\u0026ldquo;We could feel your orgasms even as we finished up with Bill and Mae,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said. \u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t decide to become pregnant, did you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Emma signed, still twitching with pleasure as MuSu\u0026rsquo;s cock still throbbed, stiff as ever, within her.\n\u0026ldquo;Then what did you do?\u0026rdquo; Rikki demanded.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s easy,\u0026rdquo; Emma sighed, reluctantly pulling herself free from MuSu\u0026rsquo;s cock. \u0026ldquo;Just keep swimming slowly until he catches you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s it?\u0026rdquo; Cleo asked, incredulous.\n\u0026ldquo;Then let him pull both of you through the water,\u0026rdquo; she said, kissing MuSu deeply.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s so special about that?\u0026rdquo; Cleo asked.\n\u0026ldquo;With only his cock,\u0026rdquo; Emma said with a deliriously happy smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Ohhhh,\u0026rdquo; Cleo squealed understanding, and she began to swim slowly out into the storm.\n\u0026ldquo;Take your time,\u0026rdquo; Emma said to MuSu with a smile.\n\u0026ldquo;But not too much time,\u0026rdquo; Rikki warned.\nThe storm was fading as the morning sun broke through the receding clouds. The sounds of the jungle filled the air with birds and the breeze wafting through the damp undergrowth. Turi fingered the gun at his side in the early morning light, looking intently at Tuo\u0026rsquo;s back. He raised his hand and closed his fingers around the trigger. He paused and sighted down the barrel, trying to stop his hand from shaking.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you doing?\u0026rdquo; Tiki asked in Polynesian.\n\u0026ldquo;Stay out of this,\u0026rdquo; Turi hissed, watching Tuo turn in his sleep.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Tiki said. \u0026ldquo;This is unworthy of you cousin. There is no honor here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There is honor in five million American dollars,\u0026rdquo; Turi said as he brought his other arm up to steady the gun.\nTiki reached across the floor and grabbed Turi\u0026rsquo;s arm, but he was not as strong or as quick as Tuo. The two men struggled, and several shots rang out. Dawn startled awake as the two men scuffled, and watched as the bullets sprayed the room. She screamed. Tuo sprang from the floor and snatched the gun from Turi\u0026rsquo;s waving hand. He tossed it out the window, and gave a quick chop to Turi\u0026rsquo;s neck. The smaller man went limp, unconscious. Tiki groaned.\n\u0026ldquo;I hit,\u0026rdquo; he said, holding his stomach.\nDawn turned to Sandy and saw a deep red gash along his forehead where one of the bullets had grazed his skull. She quickly crawled to his side, and probed the wound with her nearly insensitive fingers. She met bone, solid bone the whole length of the scar. Thank God! However, he was bleeding badly, the mermaid milk was now less active in his body, and the open gash was not closing very quickly. Sandy would be all right if she could get him some mermaid milk.\n\u0026ldquo;Help me,\u0026rdquo; she pleaded to Tuo.\n\u0026ldquo;How?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The bottles; they heal. Give me one,\u0026rdquo; she said urgently.\n\u0026ldquo;Him?\u0026rdquo; Tuo asked, indicating Tiki who was bleeding profusely.\n\u0026ldquo;Take one for him, pour a little on the wound and have him drink the rest,\u0026rdquo; she urged. \u0026ldquo;I need one for Sandy,\u0026rdquo; she pleaded, nearly to the point of tears.\nTuo ran to the table, and grabbed two bottles of the four bottles. He thrust one into Sally\u0026rsquo;s hands, took the other, and poured some on Tiki\u0026rsquo;s stomach, helping him drink the rest.\n\u0026ldquo;Tuo shot,\u0026rdquo; Rangi said, pointing at Tuo\u0026rsquo;s leg from across the room.\nTuo looked down and saw the blood pouring from his calf. He glanced back at Tiki and could see that the substance in the bottles was in fact mending Tiki\u0026rsquo;s stomach. He ran back to the table and grabbed another bottle. He splashed some on his leg, and chugged the rest down.\n\u0026ldquo;You shot?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Rangi answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Then why blood?\u0026rdquo; Tuo asked, pointing at the wall behind Rangi\u0026rsquo;s back where a deep red stain was spreading.\nRangi turned and looked at the wall and then at his side. A small hole was in his abdomen, and a larger hole was in his back. He looked stupidly at Tuo.\n\u0026ldquo;I shot,\u0026rdquo; he said dreamily. \u0026ldquo;Good.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Kill no good,\u0026rdquo; Tuo repeated, grabbed the last bottle, and limped over to Rangi, his leg tingling and his head feeling dizzy. \u0026ldquo;Drink,\u0026rdquo; he ordered after he splashed some white liquid over Rangi\u0026rsquo;s wounds.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;I dishonored. Turi bring dishonor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Drink,\u0026rdquo; Tuo repeated, forcing some liquid down the dazed man\u0026rsquo;s throat.\nDawn tried to force more milk between Sandy\u0026rsquo;s unconscious lips, but she could barely hold the bottle. She whimpered in frustration.\n\u0026ldquo;Help me,\u0026rdquo; she pleaded again.\nTuo withdrew a knife from a sheath strapped to his leg and sliced the ropes at her wrist with a single stroke. She nearly dropped the bottle with the release of pressure, but she managed to hold it upright. She tried to raise the bottle to Sandy\u0026rsquo;s face, but her arms were asleep, and her legs too would not follow her brain\u0026rsquo;s orders to action. She was nearly weeping with frustration as Tuo finished freeing both Dawn and Sandy from their bindings.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t \u0026hellip; I can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; she sobbed, as her arms refused to raise themselves from her lap.\nTuo took the bottle gently from her hand, and sat down next to her. He lifted the unconscious man into his lap. He dripped some milk along the gash and then tilted Sandy\u0026rsquo;s head back until his throat opened and put the bottle to his lips. Sandy gagged at first, and then reflexively gulped a few drafts of milk down. He did not regain consciousness, but his bleeding slowed, and the wound began to close.\nDawn collapsed next to Sandy and Tuo, trying to regain her composure. Something was wrong, and raw fear was pressing on her chest like an elephant. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t get her breath. She looked up and saw Tuo pushing Sandy\u0026rsquo;s hair from his face, and in an instant, she knew what was wrong. However, as she struggled to shout out her warning, her exhaustion, fear, and relief overcame her, and she fainted onto the floor.\n\u0026ldquo;Everything be better,\u0026rdquo; Tuo said softly.\nHe looked around the room and saw that no one was conscious to hear him. He could feel his own body buzzing, and his leg was quickly healing. He didn\u0026rsquo;t know why, but he thought that both of the two blond Americans were very attractive. With that thought puzzling him, he also succumbed to the healing sleep of the mermaid\u0026rsquo;s milk.\nThe shots that rang out in the mountainside hut went unobserved in the listening room; no one was there. Eve, who was waiting in the Moon Pool cave, thought she heard some faint popping, like logs burning in a fire, echoing down from the chimney high above. But with the humming from the pool below, it was hard to tell what she heard. Below her, in the pool, Bill was finishing his transition into a merman.\nMae had gone first, and the final step in the transformation from a forty-two-year-old woman into the stunning mermaid with long blond hair, a yellow and blue mottled tail with pink fringes had taken only twenty minutes. Now Bill was nearly done, his maroon tail with yellow highlights matching his still curly red hair. His hair now reached halfway down his back, and his long body arched backwards upon itself for a few seconds before he relaxed in the water.\nEve sighed. She felt old now, every single one of her thirty-two years. She watched wistfully as the mers collapsed into their pods, each making love with one another. She felt her own passion rise. She hoped that Sandy and Dawn were well on their own way, the cancer cured, and then she could join them in transition later.\nDawn was the first to regain consciousness. She looked around the hut, saw the deep red stains all around the room, and shuddered again at the memory. She saw Sandy breathing evenly, his forehead nearly healed, his head resting on Tuo\u0026rsquo;s lap. She rose to lift Sandy away from the tall Chinese man, but a groan from Turi stopped her. He was stirring.\nThinking quickly, she took the ropes that had bound Sandy and rushed over to Turi. He was still mostly unconscious, and she bound his hands behind his back before he started to move with some purpose. It took her many minutes to get his hands tied securely enough for her to be satisfied.\n\u0026ldquo;Do legs,\u0026rdquo; a soft voice whispered.\nShe spun around and saw Rangi opening his eyes, looking at her.\n\u0026ldquo;He do kung fu,\u0026rdquo; he said, struggling awake. \u0026ldquo;Tie legs.\u0026rdquo;\nDawn scrambled around the room, looking for more rope, cursing her still tired, bruised and sore limbs. She found some long enough and began binding Turi\u0026rsquo;s legs together. By now, he was beginning to moan inarticulately in Tongan, which Dawn did not understand.\n\u0026ldquo;More,\u0026rdquo; Rangi struggled to say. \u0026ldquo;He a bad man.\u0026rdquo;\nDawn was desperate to reach Sandy, but she knew that none of them would be safe if Turi got free. She found another piece of rope, and then following Rangi\u0026rsquo;s directions, she looped part of it around his neck, under his hands, and then down to his ankles. She bent them up and secured the rope between his now bent ankles and the loop that went around his neck. Just as she finished the last knot, Turi snapped awake, nearly strangling himself as he struggled to get free of the ropes.\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Rangi said, smiling, his eyes fluttering as he struggled to stay awake.\n\u0026ldquo;Free me!\u0026rdquo; Turi demanded, choking himself on his own effort to get loose.\nDawn, seeing that he was indeed securely bound, ignored his demands and went to Tuo\u0026rsquo;s and Sandy\u0026rsquo;s side. She sank to the floor beside the two unconscious men, and tried to stop the sobs that welled up in her throat. Sandy\u0026rsquo;s face had already lost the angles of masculinity he possessed that morning, and his hair was now down to his shoulders. The exposure to Tuo and the mermaid milk they all had consumed had begun his journey into femininity. She looked up into Tuo\u0026rsquo;s still unconscious face and saw his increased masculinity, his broader shoulders, and she collapsed onto both of them.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Sandy my love,\u0026rdquo; she cried. \u0026ldquo;What have I done?\u0026rdquo;\nEve sprinted up the jungle path, her heart pounding, a Russian Gsh-18 pistol clutched in her hand. After Bill and Mae had finished changing, and the mers had had their sexual release, MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod had go to the listening room for a bit of rest time, not needing quite the same level of sexual workout as the other mers. There, they heard deep voices coming from the mountainside huts, voices that were not Sandy\u0026rsquo;s or Dawn\u0026rsquo;s. The mers rushed over to the lagoon, armed Eve with some canteens and a gun, and sent her up the mountain. She had no thought in her head as to what she would do when she got there, but she ran like a woman possessed.\nMuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod and Bill and Mae each circled the island in opposite directions, looking for the boat the strange men must have used. Bill and Mae found it first, and saw that it was ruined. Mae sent out a vocal pulse that indicated they had found something, and they waited for MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod to arrive. When they did, MuSu and Rikki leapt up into the stranded boat and gathered what materials they could find that could tell them who these people were. Then, the six of them swam quickly back to the lagoon.\nAs Eve neared the mountainside huts, she could see people moving around inside the largest hut. She crouched down, hiding in the undergrowth along the side of the path. Suddenly a large Chinese man emerged from the doorway carrying another man on his back. The smaller man was bound and gagged but still struggling. Behind him, she watched as Dawn and Sandy emerged too, and then behind them two more islander men followed. No one had any weapons that she could see.\nShe jumped out into the path, brandishing her gun.\n\u0026ldquo;Sandy, Dawn!\u0026rdquo; she shouted. \u0026ldquo;Run!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s O.K. Eve,\u0026rdquo; Sandy said softly. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re O.K.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sandy?\u0026rdquo; Eve asked. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with your voice?\u0026rdquo;\nSandy lay on the warm sand, listening to Liga explain to Tiki and Rangi, in broken Tongan, what the mermaid milk had done to them. MuSu had already explained things to Tuo, who now stood alone on the beach, facing the water, absorbing the shock of meeting the mers and the knowledge that the milk they consumed had started them on an irreversible journey. Next to him, he could still feel Dawn\u0026rsquo;s quiet sobs as she struggled with the news that only Tuo\u0026rsquo;s death could alter Sandy\u0026rsquo;s fate.\nThe last thing in the world that Sandy wanted was to cause the death of someone else, especially when that someone else had saved their lives. He had no desire to become a mermaid, but according to Pat\u0026rsquo;s sad pronouncement, the process of bonding had already started. Eric explained that he could already see the tendrils of energy that linked Dawn, Sandy, and Tuo together, that their bonds would never go away, and that only Tuo\u0026rsquo;s death would allow Sandy to return to masculinity.\nHe could already feel his changed body, his hair was down to his shoulders, his hips had been aching all day, and his limbs felt smaller than they had the day before. He could still feel his cock in between his legs, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t want to check.\nIt had been a long afternoon, trying to get everyone\u0026rsquo;s stories out. Tuo\u0026rsquo;s was the easiest because thanks to MuSu and Xing, nearly all the mers spoke perfect Mandarin. Only Liga and Alexis spoke much Tongan/Polynesian, but Sally and Eric were learning quickly. Turi had refused to talk, and so he remained tied up in one of the huts on the beach. Hearing Shen Chin\u0026rsquo;s story from Tuo had surprised everyone, especially when Tuo mentioned that he was supposed to radio her on a special frequency later that evening.\nSandy raised himself up to his elbows and looked out at the gathered mers. John\u0026rsquo;s pod was entirely in the water, all his mermaids were very pregnant and now found land to be nearly unbearable. Everyone else was on the beach, waiting as Liga finished answering Tiki\u0026rsquo;s and Rangi\u0026rsquo;s questions. He could see Tuo shrug his shoulders and begin to walk down the beach away from them. He immediately sensed that Tuo was going to harm himself.\n\u0026ldquo;Tuo,\u0026rdquo; he called out.\nTuo turned and looked. Sandy waved him to return to the group, and he slowly began walking towards them.\n\u0026ldquo;Dawn,\u0026rdquo; he said rising up to a sitting position. \u0026ldquo;Dawn, we can\u0026rsquo;t let Tuo die. He saved our lives.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But,\u0026rdquo; she sobbed. \u0026ldquo;What about you and me, us?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will be sister-wives,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t that what you call it?\u0026rdquo; he asked Alexis who was nearby.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; she answered. \u0026ldquo;Sally and Liga are as much to me as Eric, sometimes more.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;See honey,\u0026rdquo; he said, lifting her chin. \u0026ldquo;We will always be together, we will still be pod-mates. I will love you just as much as I do now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But you will be loving someone else,\u0026rdquo; she sobbed. \u0026ldquo;And I don\u0026rsquo;t think I could ever love anyone else the way I love you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can no force me,\u0026rdquo; Tuo said, as he drew near.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have a choice,\u0026rdquo; Sandy argued. \u0026ldquo;And you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be forcing yourself on us. Whether we like it or not, we are already connected.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why aren\u0026rsquo;t you fighting to stay a man?\u0026rdquo; Dawn wailed, beating her fists on Sandy. \u0026ldquo;My man! How can you be so weak?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Dawn, stop! It\u0026rsquo;s not his fault,\u0026rdquo; Galina said with some force. \u0026ldquo;The mermaid milk does its work and doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about accidents. Sandy was turned, whether he likes it or not, and the siren cell has changed his body and his mind. It\u0026rsquo;s not his fault. All of us who have changed sexes have felt the same way.\u0026rdquo;\nDawn burst into body wrenching sobs, as she struggled to apologize for her outburst.\n\u0026ldquo;I be honorable,\u0026rdquo; Tuo said. \u0026ldquo;I go.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; Sandy argued. \u0026ldquo;You already did the honorable thing. You stopped Turi. You saved our lives. My change was just an accident, fate. Now I must be honorable, please do not take that away from me by harming yourself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;To be mermaid, honorable?\u0026rdquo; Tuo asked, surprised by this rationale.\n\u0026ldquo;To keep your honor is honorable,\u0026rdquo; Sandy said. \u0026ldquo;You saved our lives, and you are trying to help Shen Chin. I will become one of your mermaids as long as I can remain Dawn\u0026rsquo;s mate: her first mate.\u0026rdquo;\nHe put his arms around his sobbing wife, and tried to calm her.\n\u0026ldquo;And I will be her second mate,\u0026rdquo; Eve added, sitting on Dawn\u0026rsquo;s other flank, joining in a group hug.\nTuo looked down at the three of them and shook his head. He looked over at MuSu and raised an eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;Mermaids carry the pod\u0026rsquo;s future,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said in Mandarin. \u0026ldquo;Mermen must protect. It is a great burden, but there are many benefits,\u0026rdquo; he finished, waving his hand towards his own mermaids. \u0026ldquo;If you act with honor, you will be well rewarded.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Three times well rewarded,\u0026rdquo; Emma added in Mandarin as she lay her head on MuSu\u0026rsquo;s shoulder.\nTuo pulled away from Alexis' breast, feeling his third feeding, counting the bottle from that morning, course through his body. He was already feeling stronger, taller, and he could tell that the combined efforts of Sandi, Dawn, and Eve were beginning to reshape his body, making him taller still, and stronger.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright you have three hours,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said as she watched Sandi, Dawn, and Eve finish their feedings with the triplets. I will be back with Emma and we will go to the lab and radio Shen, right? After that, you can have the last feeding before transition.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Tuo answered, feeling the power of the milk course through his body.\nThe four mermaids waddled back over to the edge of the pool in the nursery cave and disappeared into the water. The nursery cave had a low ceiling but a wide shallow pool. The room was illuminated with the same pale green light that glowed in nearly all the caves in the mercomplex. The nursery cave was so designated because it had a single tunnel connecting back to the Moon Pool, so wayward children could only return to the main area. Tonight, however, it was nursing a different kind of growth.\nTuo watched appreciatively as Sandi rose from the water, her body nearly finished changing. During the first phase of Sandi\u0026rsquo;s transformation, they had to keep rinsing Sandi off as body mass oozed into the water. Now, as per Sandi\u0026rsquo;s wishes, and the combined mental energies of Tuo and the other girls, Sandi was now nearly the exact twin of her former wife. Eve was still tall, five foot eight inches, and her long blond hair and blue eyes sparkled with new youthfulness. Her figure had filled out slightly, and her breasts now sat high and firm on her chest. Sandi had shrunk down to Dawn\u0026rsquo;s height, about five foot two inches tall. Both of them had long blond hair that already reached their butts, and both were built like classic blond bombshells. Dawn\u0026rsquo;s breasts returned to their nearly horizontal DD status when she was in high school, and Sandi\u0026rsquo;s still growing breasts were half that size.\n\u0026ldquo;Tuo, come over hear,\u0026rdquo; Dawn ordered, distracting him from his visual appreciation. \u0026ldquo;Lie down in the water here.\u0026rdquo;\nTuo walked over to where his pod lay in the shallow pool, stretching his legs next to Sandi\u0026rsquo;s reclining body. Dawn grasped his now very impressive cock, and pointed it at Sandi\u0026rsquo;s face.\n\u0026ldquo;One more time, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be finished,\u0026rdquo; she urged.\nSandi looked at the eight-inch cock that throbbed before her, and then up at the strangely familiar but now transformed face of Tuo. She smiled, recognizing Jason\u0026rsquo;s features in Tuo\u0026rsquo;s subtly altered eyes, hair, and face. While he was still of Asian heritage, Tuo now looked more mixed-race, and he was completely gorgeous.\n\u0026ldquo;So, you still have a thing for Jason, eh?\u0026rdquo; Sandi teased as she slid Tuo\u0026rsquo;s massive tool into her mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;I do not!\u0026rdquo; both Eve and Dawn protested in unison.\nEveryone stopped and looked at one another; even Tuo was surprised. Sandi pulled Tuo\u0026rsquo;s cock from her lips and rested the crown against the side of her cheek.\n\u0026ldquo;Um, Eve, you too?\u0026rdquo; she asked, even as she could feel the last stages of her transformation into a woman throb through her body, her breasts growing quickly, her nipples now brushing against Tuo\u0026rsquo;s thigh.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, um \u0026hellip; he was single after you showed up,\u0026rdquo; Eve protested.\n\u0026ldquo;How many times did you sleep with him?\u0026rdquo; Dawn demanded.\n\u0026ldquo;What makes you think that I slept with him?\u0026rdquo; Eve asked.\nDawn said nothing but merely pointed at Tuo\u0026rsquo;s large cock. About an inch from her pointing finger was a small birthmark in the shape of a clover, just below where Sandi was now stroking his cock back into her mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;Well \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; er \u0026hellip; SO WHAT!\u0026rdquo; Eve protested. \u0026ldquo;You slept with him too!\u0026rdquo; she said accusingly.\n\u0026ldquo;But I wasn\u0026rsquo;t focusing on Tuo\u0026rsquo;s body, you were,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said, trying to hold back her own laughter. \u0026ldquo;I was focusing on Sandi, remember?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;O.K., then well, what can I say?\u0026rdquo; Eve said. \u0026ldquo;Jason was one of the best lovers I ever had,\u0026rdquo; she shrugged her shoulders. \u0026ldquo;I almost said something to you back in college. I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe that you left him for Sandy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean by that?\u0026rdquo; Sandi challenged, squeezing the base of Tuo\u0026rsquo;s cock so that he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t cum while she settled this matter.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve come to know why since then,\u0026rdquo; she protested. \u0026ldquo;Dawn has never complained about your abilities or your size.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s because size has nothing to do with being a great lover,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said, stroking Sandi\u0026rsquo;s hair. \u0026ldquo;Sandy was the most giving, gentle, and imaginative lover that I ever had. Skill and imagination are more important than size.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Eve agreed. \u0026ldquo;Besides, Jason was a self-centered jerk. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry Sandi, I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean to suggest that you were inadequate. You\u0026rsquo;re not upset about Tuo looking a little bit like Jason are you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; she said as she gave Tuo\u0026rsquo;s cock a good lick. \u0026ldquo;Jason might have been good looking and well built, but Tuo is even more handsome.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah \u0026hellip; thanks,\u0026rdquo; Tuo said as Sandi returned to his cock for a few more strokes.\nSandi could feel that her body was now complete, finished, and she rose up onto her feet in the shallow water. All four of them gasped as they took in the final product. Dawn stood up next to her, and they were indeed identical twins.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you finished?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes,\u0026rdquo; Sandi said. \u0026ldquo;Now it\u0026rsquo;s my turn to see how good Jason\u0026rsquo;s equipment actually was,\u0026rdquo; she said as she crooked her finger at Tuo, who eagerly rose to his feet as well. \u0026ldquo;But there will be a big difference.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s that?\u0026rdquo; Eve asked, watching as Tuo towered over Sandi and Dawn.\n\u0026ldquo;While you two have been concentrating on our bodies, I\u0026rsquo;ve been concentrating on Tuo\u0026rsquo;s imagination,\u0026rdquo; she said with a sultry smile.\nDawn nearly fainted, finding it hard to breath suddenly. \u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; she gasped, her chest rising and falling rapidly.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes, I did,\u0026rdquo; Sandi said, as she jumped up into Tuo\u0026rsquo;s arms, wrapping her legs around his waist, his cock sticking out below her well rounded ass. She pushed her now wet vagina into his belly and her breasts into his broad and muscular chest. \u0026ldquo;Dawn, my sister-wife, put it into me,\u0026rdquo; she urged as Tuo lowered his hands to her hips and lifted her small but shapely body away from his own.\nDawn reached under Sandi\u0026rsquo;s perfect bubble butt and lifted Tuo\u0026rsquo;s cock up to a forty-five degree angle. Tuo then gently lowered Sandi onto his cock. She started moaning as it pierced her sex for the first time, a low moan that grew in intensity as Tuo slowly, ever so slowly, lowered her down, centimeter by centimeter. Eve and Dawn began stroking the two lovers along their shoulders and sides as Sandi continued her inevitable journey towards womanhood. She squealed briefly when her hymen broke, but Tuo\u0026rsquo;s slow, gentle progress continued without further pain. Finally, he was buried completely within her new womb.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, gods and goddesses,\u0026rdquo; Sandi moaned. \u0026ldquo;Tuo\u0026rsquo;s so big \u0026hellip; so good.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I will spend my life serving you,\u0026rdquo; he said, looking into her eyes as he slowly raised her back up the entire length of his cock.\n\u0026ldquo;That would be the honorable thing to do,\u0026rdquo; Sandi agreed, as Tuo let her weight push her back down onto his cock.\n\u0026ldquo;His English got better quickly,\u0026rdquo; Eve mused.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve just turned into a woman, and you\u0026rsquo;re questioning his improved English?\u0026rdquo; Sandi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Good point,\u0026rdquo; Eve said, smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;Dawn is your first, but you are my first,\u0026rdquo; Tuo said, holding Sandi\u0026rsquo;s gaze as he lifted her again. He held her at the furthest end of his stroke, only his crown still nestled within her lips, holding her easily, effortlessly. He smiled and then began to lift her up and down, only a few inches, watching her body bob before him.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, god,\u0026rdquo; Sandi moaned as she felt Tuo\u0026rsquo;s cock slide in and out, only the crown moving past her lips again and again. \u0026ldquo;See, I told you,\u0026rdquo; she said, glancing at Dawn.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, that was one of my favorites,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said, her body quaking with passion, watching as Tuo\u0026rsquo;s big cock pushed only partly in and out of Sandi\u0026rsquo;s dripping cleft. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t wait.\u0026rdquo;\nEveryone watched as Tuo\u0026rsquo;s impressive muscles kept lifting and swirling Sandi\u0026rsquo;s hips over the tip of his cock, never letting it sink in past the crown. The sound of her sex filled the cave, slipping and smacking as her juices flowed over his cock. Sandi was now whimpering constantly.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, oh, wait, more, more, oh, oh, not yet, oh, oh, NOW!\u0026rdquo; she shouted, and Tuo slammed her down onto his crotch, filling her completely.\nSandi froze for a moment, her legs clamped around Tuo\u0026rsquo;s waist, her arms clutching his biceps, her neck rigid, her eyes locked onto his. Neither lover moved. Then she exploded into an orgasm that shook her to the core, her limbs flailing, her breath coming in great sobs as she convulsed against Tuo\u0026rsquo;s strong body, again and again for many moments. Finally, she stopped moaning, and began moving up and down on Tuo\u0026rsquo;s still rigid cock again.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Eve asked surprised. \u0026ldquo;He didn\u0026rsquo;t come.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Sandi said happily, \u0026ldquo;I was in charge of his imagination and skill, remember?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; goooodddddddd,\u0026rdquo; Dawn moaned, shuddering through her own small orgasm without ever having touched herself.\nEve stood stunned, watching Sandi slowly build up steam towards her second orgasm, while Tuo\u0026rsquo;s handsome face remained locked on to Sandi\u0026rsquo;s. Dawn held onto Tuo\u0026rsquo;s other arm, her torso still shaking as she moaned in pleasure.\n\u0026ldquo;I really should have had sex with Sandy before he changed,\u0026rdquo; Eve mused.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026hellip; worry,\u0026rdquo; Sandi gasped as she pounded herself into Tuo. \u0026ldquo;You \u0026hellip; ah \u0026hellip; will! There \u0026hellip; are thousands of \u0026hellip; ways to \u0026hellip; make \u0026hellip; a \u0026hellip; girl come \u0026hellip; oooohhh \u0026hellip; and \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; spent a lifetime \u0026hellip; dedicated \u0026hellip; to discovering \u0026hellip; aaaaahhhhh \u0026hellip; each \u0026hellip; and \u0026hellip; every \u0026hellip; one \u0026hellip; of \u0026hellip; them.\u0026rdquo;\nThree hours later, everyone was smiling when Alexis returned.\nWhile Sandi completed her transformation into a woman, Alexis, Emma, and Galina hovered over the same gurney Tumibay once occupied. Pat, Phoebe, and Tiki floated in the pool at the corner of the lab cave.\n\u0026ldquo;Who is this Manalo, again?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked in Polynesian, leaning over Turi.\n\u0026ldquo;Drug boss,\u0026rdquo; he said, his body immobilized in the gurney, water surrounding him, nearly covering his face. \u0026ldquo;Malaki\u0026rsquo;s son.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Shen Chin?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked after she finished translating his answer for Emma.\n\u0026ldquo;Helper lady,\u0026rdquo; Turi said. \u0026ldquo;Manalo\u0026rsquo;s whore.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;All this is matching up with Tuo\u0026rsquo;s account,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said in English, looking at the notes Emma was taking on the computer. \u0026ldquo;Sandi was right, Tuo is honest.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, Tiki, what do you think we should do with him?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked the islander who treaded water next to her in the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;He bring dishonor, much dishonor,\u0026rdquo; Tiki said solemnly. \u0026ldquo;He be kill.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, but perhaps something else,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Is everything ready?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Everything but your input,\u0026rdquo; Emma said, salamandering over to the edge of the pool, showing Pat a cluster of plastic discs connected to wires that ran back to the gurney in which Turi lay.\nPat and Phoebe rose up from the pool and lay on the floor of the cave on their sides. Emma quickly attached a series of disks along their dorsal ridges and fed the wires into the water as Phoebe and Pat eased back into the water. Galina did the same for Alexis and Emma, and then Emma attached a final set to Galina.\n\u0026ldquo;Tiki, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to leave,\u0026rdquo; Pat warned as Alexis translated as best she could. \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t want you to get hurt.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Witness,\u0026rdquo; Tiki said. \u0026ldquo;He must know judgement.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, then go over there, but get out of the water and don\u0026rsquo;t be near anything that might conduct electricity,\u0026rdquo; she said.\nTiki hoisted himself out of the water and went to the other long, steel table near the one where Turi\u0026rsquo;s body was now strapped.\n\u0026ldquo;You lied to your family,\u0026rdquo; he said in Polynesian as Alexis translated for the mermaids. \u0026ldquo;You lied to me, and you lied to yourself. You almost killed Rangi, and me, and you tried to kill an honorable man. These magical creatures should kill you, but they won\u0026rsquo;t. Be glad it is not our elders who decide this punishment.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Dog,\u0026rdquo; Turi spat at his cousin.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s ironic,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;Because that\u0026rsquo;s what we have in mind for you. Ready girls?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ready,\u0026rdquo; everyone agreed, and Emma threw some switches at the console before her.\nAlexis leaned over the gurney and slid a long thin needle into Turi\u0026rsquo;s thigh.\n\u0026ldquo;I doubt that you will understand much of this, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you anyway,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said as she slowly depressed the plunger. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m injecting you with a distilled version of our mermaid milk, one that we have altered so that it is more viral than our natural milk. Once the siren cells multiply, they will begin changing your body. Actually, they will change your DNA.\u0026rdquo;\nAlexis withdrew the needle, and looked down at the terrified man. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you won\u0026rsquo;t die. But you\u0026rsquo;ll never kill another person ever again.\u0026rdquo;\nAll the mermaids began to hum, focusing their energies on the man in the gurney. Emma focused on the computer screen, focusing her eyes on the DNA sequence that appeared on the screen before her. She wondered, briefly, if this experiment would work, or if Turi would change into something from his own imagination. She banished the thought from her mind, and redoubled her concentration, feeling the plastic sensors along her own dorsal ridge tingle as her mer-organs revved up, sending electromagnetic signals along the wires into the tank in which Turi was bound.\nAfter a few long minutes, Tiki watched as Turi\u0026rsquo;s body began to twitch, and then waves of convulsions swept through his body. As Tiki watched in amazement, Turi\u0026rsquo;s skin turned gray and became very smooth. In the next ten minutes, his legs merged and his arms were absorbed into his torso, only his hands extended from his shoulders. Turi\u0026rsquo;s body lengthened to nearly three meters, and slowly, the outline of a dolphin began to take shape. After twenty minutes, a large female dolphin waited passively on the gurney, and the mermaids relaxed.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think it worked?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, she is a dolphin,\u0026rdquo; Emma reported, looking at her computer screen. \u0026ldquo;But we will have to test to see if any of the other abilities made it through the change.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What happened?\u0026rdquo; Tiki asked, shocked at what he had just witnessed. \u0026ldquo;Magic?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, not magic,\u0026rdquo; Alexis answered. \u0026ldquo;But close. The same way we change into mermaids, we can change nearly any living creature into something else. Turi is now a female dolphin with significantly enhanced language skills, we hope. She should be instinctually protective of mermaids, and hopefully will become a sort of family dog for us. You know, a watch dog.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So that when she has calves, she will pass on her genes and there will be enough watch dogs during storms,\u0026rdquo; Emma explained.\nTiki nodded, approving.\n\u0026ldquo;I am ready to do the honorable thing,\u0026rdquo; Tiki said.\n\u0026ldquo;And what is the honorable thing?\u0026rdquo; asked Alexis.\n\u0026ldquo;I will give my life to you too,\u0026rdquo; he said smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;As a dolphin?\u0026rdquo; she asked, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;As whatever is honorable,\u0026rdquo; he answered, his voice only betraying the slightest bit of fear.\n\u0026ldquo;You did great,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;You had me fooled.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I try best,\u0026rdquo; Tiki said, as he put down the microphone to the shortwave radio. \u0026ldquo;But I no sound like Turi.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did good,\u0026rdquo; Tuo disagreed. \u0026ldquo;Manalo believe you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, you did great,\u0026rdquo; Pat said from the pool in the corner of the lab cave. \u0026ldquo;There is only one way to find out if it worked. We wait.\u0026rdquo;\nTo be continued?\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/changes-in-paradise10/","tags":["mermaids","transgender","transformation"],"title":"Changes in Paradise: Part 10 - Re-adjustments, Reprisals, and Revelations"},{"categories":["Mermaids"],"contents":"New mers, new babies, new challenges, a new transition, and new discoveries that make Mermaid Island a busy place.\nShen Chin laughed aloud on her way back to the hotel. Finally, after years of waiting and planning, she would start her revenge. She smiled at the startled, late evening shoppers as they brushed past her in the street.\nHer plans were working better than she hoped. Tuo was able to radio her, just as planned. He had the money, and even better, Turi had been \u0026ldquo;liquidated,\u0026rdquo; whatever that meant. Tuo wouldn\u0026rsquo;t explain further. She was sure that she didn\u0026rsquo;t need to know the details, however. Now, all she had to do was get Manalo to secure one of his father\u0026rsquo;s high speed boats to reach the location Tuo had shared with her, then she could continue on to Davao, where Manalo had unknowingly transferred Lin Chen, and there she could \u0026ldquo;buy her sister\u0026rdquo; back from the brothel. Malaki would not be able to trace her movements because she would only use cash\u0026ndash;his own cash, in fact. Then, she would return to the island.\nShe stopped to look at a dress in a shop window. Tuo promised her that he had a plan so that Malaki would not be able to harm her or her sister, but only on the island. Why would Alberto\u0026rsquo;s hideaway, which Malaki certainly would not stop looking for, offer such a refuge, she wondered. Tuo was adamant; she and Lin would be safe, and Shen would understand once she got to the island. Well, that dress was going to look lovely on her slender, but shapely form. Hopefully, it would keep Manalo distracted from her true purpose. She entered the shop to try it on.\nIt was past dinnertime when she got back to the hotel room.\n\u0026ldquo;Where have you been?\u0026rdquo; Manalo demanded.\n\u0026ldquo;Shopping,\u0026rdquo; she said, holding up the dress she had bought for exactly that reason. \u0026ldquo;Would you like to see it on?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not now,\u0026rdquo; he said excitedly. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve just heard word from Turi that he has located Alberto and the money. We need to leave right now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tonight? O.K., I\u0026rsquo;ll put the dress in here for later tonight on the boat,\u0026rdquo; she said as she grabbed the suitcase that they had prepared for just such news.\nWell, she thought to herself as she carefully placed the expensive dress into the suitcase, Manalo believed the fake message from Tiki.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you going to bring your gun?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course,\u0026rdquo; he said, grabbing his gun bag. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t think I trust Turi or his cousins, do you? And what about that Chink, Tuo? Yea, I don\u0026rsquo;t trust him either.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You watch too much American television,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Shall we eat dinner on the boat?\u0026rdquo; she continued, ignoring Manalo\u0026rsquo;s racist slur. She bent over provocatively as she picked up the suitcase. \u0026ldquo;I can call the marina and have them put something on board.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, that will be fine,\u0026rdquo; he said, watching her shapely ass sway back and forth.\n\u0026ldquo;That will give us more time to \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; she winked at him.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, that will be fine too,\u0026rdquo; he said, grabbing her butt as they left the room.\nAs Shen watched him get into the limo, she wondered if tonight would be the last night she had to put up with his pathetic efforts at lovemaking. She hoped so. Racist bastard.\nSandi pushed her transformed body off Tuo\u0026rsquo;s cock, feeling the aftershocks of her most recent orgasm echo through her body. She watched as Eve took his still rampant pole and guided it towards her own vent, pulling the mammoth shaft into her mermaid\u0026rsquo;s body for the first time. Tuo\u0026rsquo;s long silver and gray tail entwined with Eve\u0026rsquo;s yellow and pink tail, and together they began to make love. Sandi hung in the water, her body still quaking, letting her gills replenish her air supply as she watched Eve\u0026rsquo;s blue fringes begin to dance with light. Tuo\u0026rsquo;s white highlights were already flickering wildly thanks to her own efforts. Next to her, she could sense Dawn floating next to her, still recovering from the orgasm she had while perched on Tuo\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fin.\nThey had all transitioned in the moonlight that evening after Alexis had gathered them from the nursery cave. They all developed the familiar red stripes down their backs in the three hours after their third feeding. Tuo went last, as had most of the other recently transformed mermen, and Sandi was his last feeder. The orgasm she felt as he fed from her breast was nothing compared to the one she just had as they made love for the first time as mers. It was incredible, a wrenching, twisting, throbbing pleasure that she had never imagined anyone could feel. Her internal muscles were still shaking.\nSandi looked over her shoulder at Dawn, who was still enjoying the orgasm she had while perched on Tuo\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fins. She wondered if they should return to his fins or spend some time alone first. Dawn smiled at her, and Sandi made up her mind.\n\u0026ldquo;Kiss me,\u0026rdquo; Sandi said to her sister wife. \u0026ldquo;Kiss me,\u0026rdquo; she repeated as she turned fully towards her.\nDawn watched Sandi turn in the water and drank in the sight of her greatly transformed husband. Sandi was now her identical twin. They both had long blond hair, piercing green eyes, and very pale blue and pink tails with bright yellow highlights that now flashed with light. They were both petite, only Xing was smaller than they were, though the two Polynesians might be as small as or smaller than Xing. They would transition later the next morning as Bill, Mae, Tiki, and Rangi were all in the newly christened \u0026ldquo;Change Cave\u0026rdquo; that had a small pool but a large, soft sandy floor that allowed humans and mers to mingle more easily.\nSandi pulled Dawn\u0026rsquo;s face to hers and kissed her soundly, pressing her body along the length of Dawn\u0026rsquo;s identical body. Sandi could feel her still swollen vent rub against Dawn\u0026rsquo;s, their erect clitoris' perfectly positioned, poking and prodding the other\u0026rsquo;s. Sandi gasped as Dawn grabbed her own now wide, scale-covered hips and pressed their bodies together. She closed her eyes and concentrated on the incredible feelings from her tail as Dawn\u0026rsquo;s equally soft tail rubbed against hers. Their tails felt softer than human skin, and they were sensitive along their entire length. Their two sets of fins each caressed one another\u0026rsquo;s, and with their flukes twisted together, each of their flukes were on the reverse side of their lover\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you still love me?\u0026rdquo; Sandi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said, her eyelids fluttering with passion. \u0026ldquo;It almost feels as though I love you more now than I did before.\u0026rdquo;\nSandi glanced down at their joined bodies, each the mirror of the other. Her full and heavy breasts pressed into Dawn\u0026rsquo;s, and their hardened nipples were both poking dents into one another\u0026rsquo;s soft flesh. Dawn\u0026rsquo;s strong hands gripped her hips, and Sandi could feel another orgasm approaching.\n\u0026ldquo;Me too,\u0026rdquo; Sandi said, surprised. \u0026ldquo;What about Eve and Tuo?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They too,\u0026rdquo; Dawn answered, grinding her hips into Sandi\u0026rsquo;s. \u0026ldquo;I love them too, but not the same as you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How is it different?\u0026rdquo; Sandi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure,\u0026rdquo; she answered, biting her lip as her own orgasm approached. \u0026ldquo;But I know that it is something more. I love you so much. I always have. You were always so gentle and giving, and now \u0026hellip; now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And now my spirit and body match?\u0026rdquo; Sandi suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;No, ah \u0026hellip; oh \u0026hellip; um \u0026hellip; that feels so good,\u0026rdquo; Dawn moaned. \u0026ldquo;There is a sense of wholeness about you \u0026hellip; about us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes, oh god \u0026hellip; right there \u0026hellip; a \u0026hellip; ahhh \u0026hellip; wholeness?\u0026rdquo; Sandi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the siren cell, or the mer-bonding, but everything just seems to fit,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said, leaning forward to kiss Sandi.\nTheir bodies merged again, their flukes fanned out and quivering against one another\u0026rsquo;s, their hips pressed together, their breasts sliding and pushing together, Dawn\u0026rsquo;s arms grasped Sandi\u0026rsquo;s hips, and Sandi held Dawn\u0026rsquo;s shoulders as they kissed. They could both feel each other\u0026rsquo;s energies, their bodies' sexual tension building, and their kissing grew more urgent. They were devouring each other\u0026rsquo;s lips, tongues, and mouths.\n\u0026ldquo;We \u0026hellip; do \u0026hellip; ah \u0026hellip; fit \u0026hellip; oooh \u0026hellip; perfectly \u0026hellip; ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Sandi agreed as another orgasm exploded within her womb, rippling outward along her torso and tail. Dawn held tightly onto Sandi\u0026rsquo;s jerking hips as she joined her sister-wife in an orgasm, their breasts spurting hot mermaid\u0026rsquo;s milk into each other\u0026rsquo;s chests. After a few moments, they both recovered, and floated a little bit away from each other. Dawn reached out and stroked Sandi\u0026rsquo;s breasts, tweaking her swollen nipples.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, ummmm, ohhhhhh, you always said they were sensitive,\u0026rdquo; Sandi gasped, pushing her breasts into Dawn\u0026rsquo;s caresses. \u0026ldquo;Now I finally \u0026hellip; under \u0026hellip; ummmm \u0026hellip; stand \u0026hellip; for myself.\u0026rdquo;\nSandi reached out and pulled Dawn\u0026rsquo;s face to her own again, their breasts pushing against one another\u0026rsquo;s. She held Dawn\u0026rsquo;s gaze in her own as she slowly, playfully brought their lips together. They both moaned as their full lips slid across each other\u0026rsquo;s, nipping, and licking at their soft, full lips. Next to them, they could hear Eve and Tuo beginning to speed up, Eve\u0026rsquo;s cries and moans filling their ears. They could hear and sense the other mermaids and mermen were all making love all around them.\n\u0026ldquo;I was right,\u0026rdquo; Sandi said, her breasts pleasantly pressing into Dawn\u0026rsquo;s, their nipples hard nubs of pleasure that slid against soft flesh. \u0026ldquo;We can still make love, just you and me.\u0026rdquo;\nSandi let one hand drop from Dawn\u0026rsquo;s face and began to trace circles on her smooth skin, working her way around Dawn\u0026rsquo;s body.\n\u0026ldquo;Your body is so perfect, so beautiful,\u0026rdquo; she said as she let her pelvic fins brush against Dawn\u0026rsquo;s waist, watching her internal muscles jump with the contact. \u0026ldquo;If I had to be a mermaid, I wanted to be just like you,\u0026rdquo; she finished her circuit of Dawn\u0026rsquo;s body, pushing herself back up into Dawn\u0026rsquo;s embrace.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe how sexy you are,\u0026rdquo; Dawn said as she pushed the hair from Sandi\u0026rsquo;s face and shoulders, watching it float like a halo around her face. She traced her fingers along the hollow of Sandi\u0026rsquo;s delicate neck. \u0026ldquo;Do I look this sexy to you too?\u0026rdquo;\nThe two mermaids looked at each other, drinking in their shared beauty. Their bright green eyes were wide and full of passion with graceful eyebrows arching above, their chins small and perfectly shaped, and their golden hair cascaded down their backs reaching below their hips. Sandi dropped her gaze to Dawn\u0026rsquo;s breasts, and watched them float in the water, always moving with each twist and quiver of her torso. She looked down at her own new breasts, and watched them sway and float in the water too.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s make love again,\u0026rdquo; Sandi said. \u0026ldquo;But this time, I\u0026rsquo;ll be your mirror,\u0026rdquo; she said as she began to stroke her own body.\nDawn smiled, remembering their old game. They used to masturbate together when they were husband and wife, talking their way towards a mutual orgasm.\n\u0026ldquo;This time will be different, \u0026quot; Dawn said, as she started to touch her own body. \u0026ldquo;You won\u0026rsquo;t just watch me; you will feel the exact same sensations as me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Sandi said with a lusty smile. \u0026ldquo;I finally get to have multiple orgasms.\u0026rdquo;\nThe twin mermaids floated centimeters from one another, each running their hands over their own bodies. Sandi matched Dawn\u0026rsquo;s actions as she lifted her hands to her face, and tracing her fingers across her full, trembling lips. Dawn sucked a finger into her mouth, and Sandi did the same. They ran their hands down their necks and across their collarbones, tracing the shape of their clavicles. Sandi felt the delicious tension that she had just released begin to build again.\nShe continued to mirror Dawn, letting her fingernails stroke the sides of her breasts, not quite reaching the nipples, gently pushing them together, and feeling their warmth as they pressed together in the cool water. They both moaned when they pinched their nipples, pulling their breasts forward in the water. They both snaked their hands down to their still throbbing vaginas. Sandi could see that Dawn\u0026rsquo;s clit was completely aroused, sticking out into the water. In fact, her entire mons swelled, raised slightly from the surface of her tail. She knew without looking that her own was equally raised and swollen. They brushed their fingers lightly across their vents, and they both jolted with pleasure.\n\u0026ldquo;Someone is on a hair trigger,\u0026rdquo; Sandi teased, even as her own hips twitched, tendrils of pleasure shooting through her body.\nDawn said nothing, but plunged two fingers into her vent, and started pumping her hand in and out of herself. She returned her other hand to her breasts, and began to push and pull on both her breasts. Sandi copied her, and together they both hurtled towards yet another orgasm. Dawn\u0026rsquo;s eyes were fluttering, her torso shaking with effort, and her hand was a piston in her vent. Dawn\u0026rsquo;s other hand settled onto her left breast, and Sandi pushed her chest forward so that their otherwise free nipples touched. It was as if lighting struck both their bodies at once.\n\u0026ldquo;Aaaaahhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Sandi moaned as a throbbing wave of pleasure gripped her abdomen and she leaned her breast more firmly into Dawn. Her body vibrated from her head to her flukes, her tail flashing with light. Her eyes rolled back in her head, and Sandi felt her vagina clamp down on her own fingers.\n\u0026ldquo;Saaaaannnnndiiiiiiiii,\u0026rdquo; Dawn squealed as they shared a massive orgasm together, their breasts again squirting hot milk into the water, enshrouding them in a mist of white.\nBehind them they heard Eve and Tuo reach their climaxes too. A few moments later, neither Sandi nor Dawn moved when Tuo and Eve reached out and brought them into a collective embrace. They were still shaking, their hands pressed into their vents, and their breasts were still pressed together.\nPat smiled as she watched the new mers make love. The Moon Pool was getting crowded, but not enough so that new rules needed to be developed. She cradled both Michelle and Mari in her arms while their mothers enjoyed the ardent attentions of their pod-mates. They were up to twenty-six mers, counting the children, with another five babies on the way, three of them within the month. Depending on how many girls Shen Chin was able to rescue, they would soon be up to a sizable number of mers. Where would they all fit? The Moon Pool could probably hold fifty mers comfortably, if in close quarters. But after that, then what would they do?\nGabriel\u0026rsquo;s pod finished first, so they swam off to the Change Cave to help Bill and Mae give Rangi and Tiki their third feeding. Bill\u0026rsquo;s two new pod-mates would transition the next morning, Rangi and Tiki opting to follow Emma and Rose\u0026rsquo;s advice about being a girl for at least overnight. Here in the Moon Pool, the remaining pods made love, satiating the sexual need created by mer-making. Pat herself struggled to maintain her composure as she held the sleeping babies, her own sexual tension increasing within her body despite her pregnancy or her current job of baby sitting. As with the last transformation, the children stayed in the Moon Pool Cave, and they seemed to understand the special moment of transition, but they always fell asleep, rather than have any sexual response to the power of the changes.\nPat felt Maureen roll again in her belly, as she sensed John rise up behind her. She leaned back into his embrace, his strong arms enfolding both her and the two mer-babies.\n\u0026ldquo;You O.K.?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m good,\u0026rdquo; Pat sighed. \u0026ldquo;Maybe a little horny; how anyone could not be is beyond me. Participating in the transformation of another person\u0026rsquo;s body, mind, and spirit is a very intimate act, but I\u0026rsquo;m content to let Michelle and Mari sleep for now. Where are Danni and Phoebe?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re keeping one another occupied,\u0026rdquo; John said, with only the barest whisper of regret. \u0026ldquo;Now that all of you are so close to delivery, no one wants to actually have sex with me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You poor baby,\u0026rdquo; Pat teased. \u0026ldquo;What will we ever do?\u0026rdquo;\nJohn\u0026rsquo;s response was interrupted by Petra who swam through the swirling clouds of white towards them. Both John and Pat could sense her unspoken need.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll take them,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, holding out her arms.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you alright?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, handing over the sleeping children, their tails drooping over her arms.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine,\u0026rdquo; Petra insisted. \u0026ldquo;I just needed to hold my daughter.\u0026rdquo;\nPetra gathered both mermaids into her arms, and Michelle stirred enough to wrap her arms around one of Petra\u0026rsquo;s magnificent breasts, using it for a pillow. Petra had helped with Tuo and his girls' transition while Liga had watched both kids in the cave above. Once Gabriel, Galina, and Xing took off for the Change Cave, Petra had made a beeline for her daughter.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll understand after you have Maureen,\u0026rdquo; Petra said. \u0026ldquo;I thought my bond to Gabriel was special, but it\u0026rsquo;s nothing compared to Michelle.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It occurs to me that we haven\u0026rsquo;t spent enough time studying our merbonding,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, sinking back into John\u0026rsquo;s embrace. \u0026ldquo;Maybe we should put Eric\u0026rsquo;s special talents to better use, and our slowly improving equipment in the lab could be of some assistance.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, nuzzling her daughter and checking Mari who was still sound asleep. \u0026ldquo;Sounds fine. Why don\u0026rsquo;t you two get rid of that sexual tension I can sense bubbling underneath your skin.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is it that obvious?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, almost with relief.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Petra smiled, winking. \u0026ldquo;John, you\u0026rsquo;re not doing your job.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d love to,\u0026rdquo; he protested. \u0026ldquo;But no one wants any help from me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There is more than just fucking, you know,\u0026rdquo; Petra teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I am well aware of that,\u0026rdquo; John said, running his hands along Pat\u0026rsquo;s flanks, teasing her swollen belly. \u0026ldquo;I still know how to use my hands.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So do I,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, turning, and she reached down for his vent. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll see you later, Petra?\u0026rdquo;\nBut she was already gone, and Pat never bothered to check. She sank down to John\u0026rsquo;s vent, and he was already opening it up for her. As his magnificent cock sprang out, he twisted his body so that they both were oriented along each other\u0026rsquo;s tails, horizontally in the water. Side by side, they floated together, each of their faces buried in each other\u0026rsquo;s vents, their tails extending beyond their heads. John had to curl around Pat\u0026rsquo;s swollen belly, but that did not turn out to be an impediment. After bringing one another to a mutually satisfying release, they floated back to vertical as Danni and Phoebe made their way through the Moon Pool towards them.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve got another transition in the morning,\u0026rdquo; Danni said, rubbing her belly. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I am happy or sad that Tiki and Rangi decided to wait until morning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I would just as soon get it over with tonight or collapse right now,\u0026rdquo; she complained. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t wait until Freya decides that she\u0026rsquo;s cooked, and I can stop feeling like a beached whale.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Danni, you have always been so impatient,\u0026rdquo; Pat said tenderly. \u0026ldquo;And you always mix your metaphors. Besides, I know the real reason why you are eager to deliver.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why\u0026rsquo;s that?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked warily.\n\u0026ldquo;Because all three of us can see how you pine and ooh and aah over Michelle and Mari,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, kissing Danni on the shoulder as they pulled up next to Pat and John. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t wait to be a mother.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Danni said dreamily, looking down at her belly. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to be a mother.\u0026rdquo;\nPat sighed. She could wait, she decided. Everything seemed so out of whack, so overwhelming, so unsettled. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait until there was nothing more to worry about than the very basics of mer survival: gathering and eating food, frolicking in the sea, and making love, again and again. A near eternity of that (she didn\u0026rsquo;t think the mers were immortal, just very long-lived) would suit her just fine.\n\u0026ldquo;Well?\u0026rdquo; demanded Malaki, watching his new executive assistant cope with the news of his sister\u0026rsquo;s captivity and enslavement. Two of his best bodyguards flanked the small Indian man, towering over him. The poor man was shaking with rage, but he was also terrified.\n\u0026ldquo;I \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; I accept the terms of my employment,\u0026rdquo; he nearly sobbed.\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said emotionlessly. \u0026ldquo;What was the report you received from my son?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He \u0026hellip; er \u0026hellip; I mean, Ms. Chen told me that they believe they have located Mr. Estanado\u0026rsquo;s boat, and will be recovering your property shortly. One of our yachts has been temporarily reassigned to this mission.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fine,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said, turning his attention to a small stack of papers on his desk. \u0026ldquo;If you hear anything unusual from Ms. Chen, notify me immediately. These two gentlemen will see you back to your desk, and they will brief you on the behavior I expect from you in the future.\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish Basra drew on every ounce of strength left to him, and turned to leave the office. He made it only a few steps before Malaki stopped him.\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. Basra,\u0026rdquo; Malaki\u0026rsquo;s voice said in the same monotone that characterized all their conversations. \u0026ldquo;I trust I will not need to worry about your discretion or your loyalty.\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish forced himself to smile, the pictures of his elder sister, Geeta, fresh in his mind, and thought of his two other sisters and the danger in which his own ambition had put them. He turned to his employer, now his tormentor, and struggled to maintain his composure.\n\u0026ldquo;No, sir,\u0026rdquo; he said, almost as calmly as he intended himself to sound. \u0026ldquo;You can count on my cooperation as long as I can count on yours.\u0026rdquo; He waited for Malaki to give some indication that they had reached a bargain, but the other man made no sign and remained focused on his paperwork.\nAfter a few seconds more, Sudhish turned and walked out of the office.\nJoy waded out into the water a third time, making her way around the small seaplane she had secured for the next step of her mission. There were limited choices in Tarawa, and this was the only plane she could buy without attracting unwanted attention. The plane was old but had been adapted for the long distances between islands. There were no passenger seats, just cargo space, which was just fine with her. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t taking any passengers, though she hoped she might have one on the return trip.\nThe plane was in good shape considering the price she paid for it, she thought dryly. Well, there was only one way to find out for sure. She hoisted herself up into the cockpit of the DeHavilland DHC-2 Beaver floatplane, and fired up the old radial engines. They sounded good, and she eased the plane away from the dock, towards the open sea. Based on her calculations, she should have enough fuel for at least two trips out to 399. As the old engines roared, the plane broke free from the water, and she waited until she was well away from prying eyes before she banked the plane towards the island to the south. She should get there by mid-afternoon.\nTimi (formerly Tiki) sighed as her body shuddered in the final release of her transformation into a mermaid. She looked across the Moon Pool and gazed lovingly at her new pod mates who beckoned to her. She looked down at her body, now quite changed, and admired her golden tail, shimmering with blue highlights along her fins and flukes as the morning sun filtered down into the water. She lifted her golden brown arms up to her face, marveling at how slim and delicate her new fingers looked. Beyond her new feminine fingers and nails, she could see all the pods gathering around their mermen, beautiful bodies and tails entwining and twirling in the water.\nShe swam over to Bill, admiring his barrel chest, his strong chin, and his thick swirl of red hair. Ragi (formerly Rangi) waited next to him, her sky blue tail with white fringes shining in the light that drifted down. Her thick black hair, golden brown skin, and dark brown eyes mirrored Timi\u0026rsquo;s own. Mae, her new sister wife, had been her last feeder, and she admired once again Mae\u0026rsquo;s yellow and blue tail, her pink fringes, and her long blond hair. She glanced down at her own chest, noting that her new breasts were smaller than Mae\u0026rsquo;s were, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t mind. She knew that her changed body was exactly what Bill, Mae, and Ragi had wanted, and she smiled shyly as she felt their desire wash over her.\nShe looked at Ragi, practically her twin, though their tails were each unique. She remembered Rangi\u0026rsquo;s easy acceptance of her (Tiki\u0026rsquo;s) pledge to the mers. She initially worried that Rangi would balk at her promise, but when they talked about it; both agreed that there was something powerful about the mers, something they couldn\u0026rsquo;t seem to resist. Ragi was now beautiful, a perfect Polynesian mermaid. Timi was glad to be a mermaid herself finally, and she felt the power of her new body surge through her.\nJust like Ragi, she too was a petite, shapely mermaid, with rich, lustrous, dark brown skin, her long and powerful tail flashing with both internal and reflected light as she pushed her way towards her new pod-mates. Her delicate neck sloped down to feminine arms, and her narrow rib cage supported two firm breasts with large, dark chocolate nipples. Her narrow waist seemed impossibly small, especially as it widened out to her new hips, from which sprang her new pelvic fins and below which her golden tail shimmered.\nThey had each transitioned from man to woman the previous evening. Their transition into mermaids this morning had taken less than twenty minutes. Pat had explained during their second feeding that pregnant mermaids produced even more powerful milk than the others, and Ragi and Timi had an especially speedy transition because the \u0026ldquo;male\u0026rdquo; they were bonding to, Bill, was already a merman. Bill\u0026rsquo;s mer-semen was much more powerful than siren-cell-infused-human-male-semen.\nTimi remembered two sessions in the new \u0026ldquo;change cave\u0026rdquo; in which they had spent the night as she floated towards Bill. The first time s(he) lay down along Bill\u0026rsquo;s long tail to drink from his cock, Timi (Tiki) had hesitated, but there was something inside him that pushed him to that long, white cock, such a contrast with (his) own dark brown hand that encircled it. It had taken only that first feeding from Bill and Mae to push both Tiki and Rangi towards womanhood, and Timi had thrilled to her new sexual awakening.\nPat suggested that they be with Bill and Mae alone for their first feeding to help focus their bonding. First, they both fed from Mae, feeling her mermaid\u0026rsquo;s milk begin to transform their bodies, and then they shared Bill\u0026rsquo;s cock. After their third feeding, where Xing added her pregnant milk to their mix, their transition into women speeded up. When they were complete, both she and Ragi had ridden Bill\u0026rsquo;s cock while he lay on the soft sand of the transition cave, but they were both eager for morning to arrive. They wanted so much to be mers.\nNow, she was a mermaid, and she was eager to make love. She wanted Bill\u0026rsquo;s cock inside her, in the new space within her that ached with need.\n\u0026ldquo;Let me honor you,\u0026rdquo; she said softly, feeling her passion grow within her body.\n\u0026ldquo;No, let us honor you,\u0026rdquo; Bill said with tenderness, his body responding to his newest pod-mate.\nHe internally tugged on his special vent muscle and freed his cock, now fully recovered from feeding both Ragi and Timi. He looked over his new pod, feeling intensely protective of his mermaids. Mae was on his right; his wife of many years restored to her youthfulness, her long body a picture of power and beauty, just like her sister, who was now bonded with Tuo. Her breasts remained the modest C cup of her past, but they seemed rounder, fuller. He remembered how her kindness and encouragement helped the two Polynesians make their transition from men to women easier.\nThis morning, the two cousins turned quickly, almost effortlessly, from women into mermaids. Now, Timi floated in the water before him, and Ragi on his left. The two Polynesian mermaids were equally beautiful, but very different from Mae. They were tiny, officially, the smallest mermaids of all, and each glowed a golden brown, their jet-black hair floated around their faces, round and graceful, with sparkling dark brown eyes, full lips, and pointed chins. Their breasts were smaller than Mae\u0026rsquo;s were, but they looked enormous on their petite bodies.\nMae and Ragi reached out to Timi, and held her pelvic fins as they guided the trembling mermaid towards Bill\u0026rsquo;s cock, sticking out like a white flag pole from his maroon tail. His green eyes flashed with desire, and Mae settled her own vent onto his right pelvic fin, which was now beginning to vibrate. She watched as Timi\u0026rsquo;s eyes rolled back into her head as Bill\u0026rsquo;s stiff cock slowly eased into her new vagina.\nTimi was overwhelmed with sensations. Her body was rising to an orgasm, and she could feel Bill\u0026rsquo;s thick cock slowly stretching her new vagina. She thought back to the last time she had sex as a man, and nothing in her memory was close to what she was experiencing now. Each ripple of flesh within her own taut tunnel sent new spasms of pleasure racing through her body. Bill\u0026rsquo;s cock slowly pushed into her, and she felt that memories of being anything other than a mermaid were pushed from her mind. She didn\u0026rsquo;t feel afraid; she only felt desire.\nMae looked at the petite mermaid through her own-lidded eyes. She could feel Timi\u0026rsquo;s swirling emotions but sensed that there was no pain, no fear. She pressed her own vent onto Bill\u0026rsquo;s vibrating pelvic fin, letting her new body lift her to heights of pleasure that she hadn\u0026rsquo;t felt in thirty years.\nRagi looked with a mixture of desire and worry as Bill\u0026rsquo;s cock slowly slipped into her transformed cousin. She knew that she was next, and the thought both thrilled and frightened her. Only about a third of Bill\u0026rsquo;s long, thick cock was inside Timi\u0026rsquo;s tiny body, and it looked like she was in pain. She tried to trust her new mer senses, which didn\u0026rsquo;t show that Timi was feeling any fear, but her beautiful round face was twisted in a grimace, her eyes were fluttering as though she could barely stay conscious, and the muscles on her arms were taut. Timi could feel each millimeter of Bill\u0026rsquo;s thick cock push forward, and the tension in her belly grew with each ripple of flesh that pressed within her. When half his cock was inside her, she began to feel orgasms shaking her body with pleasure, her breasts spurting milk into the water. With each spasm of pleasure from her womb, she gave a great yelp. Her eyes shot open, as she watched Bill continue to press into her body.\nBill felt Timi\u0026rsquo;s vagina begin to pulse around his cock, and he smiled as he realized that Timi would be an extraordinary lover. Even Mae, recently transformed, did not respond in such a blatantly sexual way. Bill focused on his fins both of which pressed into a mermaid, tried to keep from erupting into the quaking and yelping mermaid who was slowly enveloping his cock. He felt Ragi shudder in her own orgasm as she pressed her small body into his left side. Mae was getting closer and closer. He reached down to Timi\u0026rsquo;s hips, and pulled the shaking mermaid all the way onto his cock, watching her face contort in beautiful agony.\nTimi gave a massive yelp, and then whimpered into his shoulder for a few seconds. Then she began barking again, and she continued to yelp with each new wave of pleasure that rose from her womb, about every ten seconds, for the next five minutes. Each yelp accompanied several quick contractions around his cock as Timi\u0026rsquo;s new muscles convulsed sharply. Bill didn\u0026rsquo;t move; he just held her tight to his waist, feeling her incredibly tight vagina vibrate around his cock and her warm mermaid\u0026rsquo;s milk spurt against his chest. The water became clouded with her milk. Both Ragi and Mae soon joined their new sister-wife in multiple orgasms for the last two of those five minutes, when Bill finally allowed himself his own release, his tail sparkling with yellow and maroon light that flashed with each pulse of semen that he pumped into the incredibly sexy mermaid who writhed on his throbbing pole.\nHe could feel the surge of both physical pleasure and strong emotions sweep through his entire pod. If everyone only understood the real power of mermaid bonding, Bill thought to himself as he peered through the cloud of white mist that obscured the other pods from view, everyone would try to become a mer. He reached out with his mer senses, feeling each of the pods around the edge of the Moon Pool, some of them, like his own, now at rest, and some, like MuSu and his girls, still going at it as strong as ever.\nHe slowly eased Timi from her perch and kissed her full lips. Her body was still shaking, nearly uncontrollably, and he eased her to his left as Ragi swam slowly around to his front.\n\u0026ldquo;I want to honor you,\u0026rdquo; the small mermaid said softly, Ragi\u0026rsquo;s dark eyes flashing with desire.\n\u0026ldquo;The honor is entirely mine,\u0026rdquo; Bill said with a smile, enjoying the strength and power he felt from his still stiff cock.\nJoy eased her body into the hot tub, enjoying the swirl of water around her aching bones. Even though she was in fantastic shape for a sixtyyear -old woman, she still had her days. That old DeHavilland had shaken her bones loose from her sockets, and she was grateful to have discovered this mountainside retreat. She had searched for Sally for several hours, and now she simply wanted to relax. After she soaked for about an hour, she made her way back down to the beach.\nThe moment she broke through the trees, she knew something was up. Her plane was gone. She sprinted along the beach, looking for any sign of her equipment, but all of it was gone. The late afternoon sun cast longer shadows across the beach, and she could see strange tracks that crisscrossed the sand leading to where she had stowed her pack and food in one of the beach huts. She followed the tracks back to the hut, and noticed a Russian walkie-talkie inside. It crackled with static.\n\u0026ldquo;Joy Simpson?\u0026rdquo; a voice asked over the airwaves.\n\u0026ldquo;This is Joy. Who is this?\u0026rdquo; she asked, pressing what she hoped was the talk button. This was a newer model than she was used to, and she felt a sliver of fear knife through her chest as she wondered if Sally had been mixed up with some abandoned remnant of the Cold War.\n\u0026ldquo;A friend,\u0026rdquo; the voice continued. Joy couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sure that it was Sally, it didn\u0026rsquo;t sound like her, but it had been two years since they last spoke. \u0026ldquo;There is a small dinghy hidden along the western arm of the lagoon. Find it, and take all your clothes off. Get in the boat, and push it out into the lagoon, leaving the painter hanging in the water. Do you understand these instructions?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Joy answered, stepping outside the hut, scanning the lagoon, looking for some sign of who was speaking to her. She could see nothing.\n\u0026ldquo;We will contact you shortly,\u0026rdquo; the voice finished, and as the static died, it indicated that the other walkie-talkie had been shut off.\nJoy tossed the walkie-talkie back into the hut, and walked down the western arm of the lagoon. She spotted the small rubber dinghy easily, and with no hesitancy, took off her clothes and pushed the dinghy into the water. When the water was up to her waist, she hopped in, and dropped the very long, painter into the water. As she sat there, she hoped that whoever was going to meet her would not be long. She didn\u0026rsquo;t have any sunscreen.\nAfter only a few seconds, she felt the boat begin to move, and she craned her neck to see what or who had grabbed the painter and was now dragging it out to sea. The boat picked up speed, and soon she thought she could make out a mass of color and bodies about three meters underwater ahead of her. There were flashes of blue, steel, maroon, black, and red, but she couldn\u0026rsquo;t make out what kind of fish or creatures they were.\nMermaids. The thought returned to her with force, pushing all thoughts of the Russian radio and the Cold War out of her mind. No, mermen, apparently, she concluded as she peered into the water ahead of her now swiftly moving boat, noticing their uniquely male outlines beneath the water\u0026rsquo;s surface. Soon they were in the open sea, and she noticed a strange turbulence all around her boat. Now the boat was leaping across the waves, and she saw that hands were pressing against the stern of the little boat, and flashes of blue, white, gold, black, pink, and yellow churned in her wake. Mermaids! They were shaped differently than the figures still underwater ahead of her.\nJoy gaped at the figures in the water as the boat flew across the water. The dingy was moving as fast as any speedboat, but the ride was smooth. After only a few minutes, she saw the western cliffs of the volcano come into view as her boat propelled her around the island. She could see a face in the water, one that quickly resolved itself into Sally Bennett, whose eyes and hair shone like new chocolate poured from a melting pot. There was something different about Sally, something beyond her longer, richer hair, and her sparkling eyes. Joy felt a tug in her heart as she looked at Sally, one that had nothing to do with their long history together.\n\u0026ldquo;Hello Joy,\u0026rdquo; Sally said, holding up small radio. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s waterproof. Did you keep yours?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No. I \u0026hellip; er \u0026hellip; um \u0026hellip; what or \u0026hellip; er \u0026hellip; who is moving this boat?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, expecting the answer.\n\u0026ldquo;We are,\u0026rdquo; a voice from behind, answered.\nJoy turned and saw a beautiful Russian girl, her blond hair cascading around her angular face. The mermaid\u0026rsquo;s eyes were a sparkling blue, and she was smiling broadly, two sharp incisors visible. Then, a young Elizabeth Taylor lifted her face from the water, her violet eyes sparkling with humor. Behind her, three identical mermaids also lifted their heads above the surface, their bright blue eyes a dramatic contrast from their dark chocolate brown hair. Joy felt the pressure increase in her chest as she surveyed these beautiful creatures. What was causing this reaction? She had faced far stranger sights when she was an active agent. She steeled herself, and swiveled in her seat, facing Sally.\n\u0026ldquo;Friends of yours?\u0026rdquo; she asked simply, not betraying the roiling emotions that swirled within her.\n\u0026ldquo;Yep,\u0026rdquo; Sally answered smiling.\nNext to her, a new face emerged. An affable young man with black eyes and black hair gave Sally a quick kiss on the cheek as they bobbed in the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Do I have the honor of meeting Seaman Eric Edwards?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You do,\u0026rdquo; the young man answered. \u0026ldquo;How did you know my name?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Her father told me many things,\u0026rdquo; Joy answered carefully. \u0026ldquo;How about you tell me some more?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Will you pinky swear?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked, with a pleading look on her face.\nJoy looked at Sally carefully, remembering when she taught a very young girl that sometimes there were secrets so important you could never tell them, no matter what. A complex and ancient pinky ritual sealed those secrets, and the young girl, lonely and awkward and missing her recently deceased mother, never broke any of those promises. Joy reached a hand over the side of the boat, her pinky extended towards the beautiful young mermaid.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my little Sally-Su-Su,\u0026rdquo; Joy answered as earnestly as she could. \u0026ldquo;I will pinky swear.\u0026rdquo;\nThe next day, Shen Chin looked out at Manalo\u0026rsquo;s yacht now anchored in the large lagoon. She saw no sign of any other boat, and wondered how Tuo planned to surprise Manalo. The beach was too wide to allow him to rush up unnoticed, and Manalo kept his gun ready at all times. She only knew that she was supposed to get Manalo to go swimming, but so far he refused. She could see a dolphin playing in the surf near the outer reefs, and she wished that she could join it.\n\u0026ldquo;Manny,\u0026rdquo; she cooed, trying to distract her twitchy lover from his fearful scanning of the horizon. \u0026ldquo;Turi will show up, and when he does, then you can ask him where he\u0026rsquo;s been.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That bastard had better not have taken off with my father\u0026rsquo;s money,\u0026rdquo; Manalo fumed.\nThey had been on the island for most of the day, but there was no sign of Turi and his men. He had seen the bloodstains in the mountainside huts, right where Turi (Tiki) had reported over the radio that Alberto had met his end. It was too late now, but he wished he had brought some henchmen. He was getting tired, worried, and hungry.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t like to swim,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t have to swim,\u0026rdquo; Shen said, taking off her bikini. \u0026ldquo;We could just fuck.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We can do that over there,\u0026rdquo; Manalo said, pointing at the huts.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I want to feel the water around my body,\u0026rdquo; she said, caressing her now naked breasts. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you want to feel my body?\u0026rdquo; she asked as she took several steps backwards into the surf.\n\u0026ldquo;What about Turi?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You can show him what a man you are,\u0026rdquo; she purred.\nManalo smiled at that. He lowered his swim trunks to the sand and took his shoulder holster off. He followed Shen into the water, but she kept herself just ahead of him. She was laughing and smiling, working her way out into deeper water.\n\u0026ldquo;Get back here,\u0026rdquo; he growled. \u0026ldquo;I have to be able to stand up or we won\u0026rsquo;t have any leverage. Do you want to drown?\u0026rdquo;\nThe water was up to their chests, and Shen\u0026rsquo;s breasts fascinated Manalo as the waves pushed them back and forth. Shen watched as her ungainly lover stumbled gracelessly towards her, using his arms as oars, trying to keep water from splashing onto his face. Suddenly a flash of silver and gray zipped past her and curled around Manalo\u0026rsquo;s legs. He cried out, and then slowly fell forward into her arms, unmoving.\n\u0026ldquo;Keep his face in the air,\u0026rdquo; Tuo said in Mandarin, his face rising from the water.\n\u0026ldquo;What did you do?\u0026rdquo; She asked, holding the conscious but unmoving Manalo in her arms.\n\u0026ldquo;Paralyzed him,\u0026rdquo; Tuo answered. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get back to the beach; there is a lot to explain.\u0026rdquo;\nTuo took Manalo from Shen and handed his body over to the three women whose faces suddenly popped up from the water. Below the surface, Shen could see tantalizing glimpses of blue, pink, and yellow, but she couldn\u0026rsquo;t see their legs.\n\u0026ldquo;Tuo,\u0026rdquo; she said with a worried tone. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s going on here?\u0026rdquo;\nShen felt a great pressure on her chest, and the air felt thick. She ran her eyes over the incredible sight before her, three blond mermaids, two identical, and Tuo, who was himself strangely changed. He was beautiful, and Shen\u0026rsquo;s heart began to pound in her chest. Shen felt a passion that she had long repressed for any man rise within her.\n\u0026ldquo;What is happening?\u0026rdquo; she asked, her breath coming in gasps.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi Shen, I\u0026rsquo;m Sandi,\u0026rdquo; one of the girls said in Mandarin. \u0026ldquo;It will be alright. It\u0026rsquo;s a long story, but we\u0026rsquo;ll try to make it short.\u0026rdquo;\nJoy leaned back from the microscope, and rubbed her eyes. In the past few days, she had learned everything there was to know about Mermaid Island. Once she understood the situation, Joy committed herself one hundred percent. First, she helped Tuo create a plan for rescuing Shen and Tuo\u0026rsquo;s brother, and then, for the last several days, she and the mers had been brainstorming on a bigger plan, one in which the siren cells she watched squirm in the Petri dish played a key role.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think it will work?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked from the pool, her pregnancy keeping her from land.\n\u0026ldquo;I think so,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;At least it is worth a try.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have the necessary contacts?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, looking over at Sally and Eric who lounged on the examination tables, their royal blue tails gleaming in the pale blue LED\u0026rsquo;s of the lab cave. \u0026ldquo;Do you think your father will go for it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think so,\u0026rdquo; Sally said, flipping her flukes up and down. \u0026ldquo;At least I hope so.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This is a pretty big risk,\u0026rdquo; Pat worried.\n\u0026ldquo;Big rewards demand big risks,\u0026rdquo; Danni said, hugging her sister wife in the pool. \u0026ldquo;I think this is the big break I was feeling last week.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You think so?\u0026rdquo; Pat said, looking at Phoebe and John bobbing next to her, and then at the other mers scattered around the lab.\n\u0026ldquo;We changed this sea anemone using the siren cell several months ago,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said pointing to a sealed tub with several small creatures fastened to the sides and bottom of the tub. \u0026ldquo;The new species favors Serratia marcescens, the fecal coliform that exists in all human waste, which is the bacteria that is destroying coral reefs around the world. The anemones still eat other microorganisms, but they thrive on Serratia marcescens.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The anemones are stable,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe assured Joy. \u0026ldquo;They have been keeping our caves clean for several months. Mermaids excrete the same bacteria as humans in our waste.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, but you excrete so little,\u0026rdquo; Joy observed. \u0026ldquo;Your bodies are much more efficient than normal human bodies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, they are, but we estimate that these new anemones are capable of processing enormous amounts of human waste,\u0026rdquo; Alexis countered.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I do agree that once scientists understand that something like this is possible, a way will be found for you and the other mermaids to be protected,\u0026rdquo; Joy said nodding her head. \u0026ldquo;Are you sure that the siren cell can\u0026rsquo;t be used on its own?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We have tested the siren cell on multiple organisms and in several contexts, open water, our caves, etc.,\u0026rdquo; Alexis explained. \u0026ldquo;They are only active as a transformation agent for very brief periods of time outside our bodies. They retain their healing qualities indefinitely, we think, but they do not \u0026ldquo;re-write\u0026rdquo; DNA once they have been aged.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do you know?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We are still testing,\u0026rdquo; Alexis continued. \u0026ldquo;But the primary catalyst for radical transformations is the siren cell\u0026rsquo;s ability to respond to bioelectrical stimulation. Once they have been outside the body for a few minutes, they only react to biochemical stimulations, like your own white blood cells in your immune system. So changes made in the absence of our electromagnetic influence only produce natural, and somewhat random, mutations, not paranormal ones. In order to have a directed mutation occur, you need a fully cooperative mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How did you all change without a fully cooperative mermaid in the first place?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The chicken or the egg?\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a question we are still trying to answer. We think that my original goop may have been inherently unstable. We distilled it, and so it was concentrated. Now that we have incorporated it into our DNA, which is probably different from human DNA \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think you can interbreed?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, interrupting.\n\u0026ldquo;We think so,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;But the gene sequencer on the submarine was damaged by the explosion. Without one, we can only guess.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pat you were saying?\u0026rdquo; Joy prompted.\n\u0026ldquo;Right, DNA, mer or human is junk most of the time,\u0026rdquo; she continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Junk?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, junk,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;We code DNA in repeating patterns of four different letters, ACGT, each of which stand for the four types of bases that bind nucleotides together in what we call base pairs. The human genome, for example, consists of some 2.9 billion of those pairs — the equivalent of about 750 megabytes of computer data — but only about 3 percent of it goes into composing the 22,000 or so genes that make us what we are.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, maybe mermaids have more like 25,000,\u0026rdquo; Alexis suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;Only 3 percent of our genes actually control our bodies?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, stunned. \u0026ldquo;How do you know this? Didn\u0026rsquo;t we just map our genome a little while ago?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They finished in 2003, and I came to this island before they were beginning to understand all this stuff,\u0026rdquo; Pat admitted. \u0026ldquo;But Alexis and Galina have brought me up to date. The remaining 97 percent, so-called junk DNA, looks like gibberish. We don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is saying to or about us, but within that mass of megabytes there is plenty of room for the all kinds of information, including our siren cells.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;750 megabytes doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like much to me,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, shaking her head. \u0026ldquo;Are you saying we could store our DNA on a CD-ROM?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;More or less, yes,\u0026rdquo; Alexis answered. \u0026ldquo;The complete works of Shakespeare, for example, only takes up about five megabytes in plain text form.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but Shakespeare doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain why you are so certain that the siren cell can\u0026rsquo;t be used without your cooperation,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, drumming her fingers on the microscope. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong, why are you looking at me like that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because they are trying to protect me,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Why you?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, looking around the lab.\n\u0026ldquo;Because, one of our discoveries is that we probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have changed into mermaids if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t forced the issue,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe concluded.\n\u0026ldquo;What would have happened?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked. \u0026ldquo;I thought you guys were changing anyway, trapped in these caves?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We were,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;But we probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have changed much more than we already had. The siren cell needed the bioelectrical focus we gave it in the Moon Pool to effect our radical species change. Phoebe wanted to be a mermaid, and we all thought we had no choice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You could have kept your legs?\u0026rdquo; Joy wondered.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, but who would want to?\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;You see Joy, none of us miss our legs, not even Emma.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but don\u0026rsquo;t tell her that,\u0026rdquo; Emma said with a teasing smile. \u0026ldquo;I want something to hold over Phoebe.\u0026rdquo;\nPhoebe stuck her tongue out at Emma.\n\u0026ldquo;We gained several advantages in the change,\u0026rdquo; Alexis continued. \u0026ldquo;The barbs in our tails, the power of our tails, the ability to withstand deep ocean pressure, our enhanced sensory organs, the ability to actually exploit the siren cell, exceptionally long life, and several other advantages.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Like the best sex ever,\u0026rdquo; Sally said, and then blushed immediately.\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of which, how did you change sexes, then?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked. \u0026ldquo;Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you still need the bioelectrical influence?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is relatively easy to change only one chromosome in an organism, as in the change from male to female, so simple touch was probably enough to conduct the bioelectrical influence\u0026rdquo; Alexis continued. \u0026ldquo;But to change so many chromosomes, probably at least ten or more, to make the change from human into mer, that took special effort. So it needed a critical mass of people, water, and time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The good news,\u0026rdquo; Galina added. \u0026ldquo;Is that our current DNA seems very stable, and very healthy. That\u0026rsquo;s probably why we are not aging. Although we can\u0026rsquo;t sequence our DNA with our current equipment, we can still see it in the microscope. Our DNA is replicating itself in this particular pattern very efficiently with almost NO mutations.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We evidently stumbled upon a very strong, stable, and robust set of chromosomes,\u0026rdquo; Pat concluded. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think they will grant us immortality, but it is likely that we will have very, very long lives.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There is another logical construct for why you can be sure that other people cannot replicate the siren cell,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said after a moment of silence.\n\u0026ldquo;What construct is that?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It took eight humans nearly twenty four hours to force the siren cells to transform me into the first mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;As each new mer appeared, the time shortened geometrically rather than mathematically. Now it only takes twenty minutes to complete a transformation. In other words, my transformation was luck, a one in a trillion-billion chance. But after that, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t luck; it was our new mer-organs.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about Tumibay\u0026rsquo;s change?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked. \u0026ldquo;What if your new serum was stolen?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Like the original goop, it seems to be inherently unstable and unpredictable,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;We haven\u0026rsquo;t done enough testing yet, of course, but we only create enough to use at any one time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do you make it?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked. \u0026ldquo;Never mind, don\u0026rsquo;t tell me. I have a feeling that only the five of you know how to make it anyway.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Galina said. \u0026ldquo;Only I, Alexis, Pat, Emma, and Phoebe know how it is made. And no one else will know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Even without the new serum, there was, and therefore still is, a chance for something paranormal to emerge using either the original goop or mermaid milk,\u0026rdquo; Joy said.\n\u0026ldquo;A one in septentrigintillion chance,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a very small risk, and we can\u0026rsquo;t hide forever.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How did you figure those odds?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked. \u0026ldquo;A septen \u0026hellip; whatever, sounds like a big number.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;There are 46 human chromosomes with 2.9 billion base pairs, and you have to get 25,000 of them correct. That is incredibly hard to do. For example, the odds of getting seven numbers to match from a possible fifty, your average Lotto game, are over 5 billion to one. That\u0026rsquo;s for just seven numbers out of a possible fifty, rather than twenty-five thousand out of a possible three billion.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are pretty sure that Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s luck was unique,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;But Joy is right; theoretically someone else may be able to either duplicate or improve on the siren cell. But remember, the odds of success depend on the number of attempts. It would take centuries for someone to try to create a siren cell that didn\u0026rsquo;t require mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This all sounds like a pretty good argument for intelligent design,\u0026rdquo; Joy observed.\n\u0026ldquo;Not really,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said quickly. \u0026ldquo;It would depend on the number of attempts. If millions of people had access to millions of siren cells, and they were all trying to make mermaids without us, it would still take centuries to succeed, but eventually someone would make a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;100 monkeys typing Shakespeare,\u0026rdquo; Joy nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;No, that\u0026rsquo;s not the same thing, but let\u0026rsquo;s not get into that,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;There is too much science needed to explain why those are different. It is enough for us to know that the eight of us did something that day in the Moon Pool that defied the odds.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So it really is your fault that everyone here is a mer,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, giving Phoebe a look that bordered on awe.\n\u0026ldquo;No one is complaining,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, giving her sister-wife a watery hug. \u0026ldquo;We are all very happy to be mers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that really true,\u0026rdquo; Joy said wistfully. \u0026ldquo;So why would you want to stop being one? Are you sure that you can perform sallekhana if captured?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, referring to the Hindu practice of meditative suicide.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Galina said softly. \u0026ldquo;We are 99% sure that a conscious effort by us will shut down our electromagnetic organs, and that will result in our deaths.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Have you tested this?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, wrinkling her brow with the memory of that test. \u0026ldquo;But not completely, of course. Emma and Alexis revived me, and I was willing and ready to live. I\u0026rsquo;m sure that if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t cooperating, that I would have been unable to be resuscitated.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you\u0026rsquo;re sure that everyone will hold to this plan?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked with only a trace of skepticism in her voice. She had learned over the past six days that the mermaids made few claims that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t back up, but a death pact among all the mers if captured was extraordinary.\n\u0026ldquo;You haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced mermaid bonding,\u0026rdquo; Sally said. \u0026ldquo;It changes everything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you all trust me?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, looking around the room crowded with mers.\n\u0026ldquo;You pinky swore,\u0026rdquo; Sally said. \u0026ldquo;And \u0026hellip; we could sense your intentions.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right, the mer-senses,\u0026rdquo; Joy nodded. \u0026ldquo;Well, if it matters, you CAN trust me, and \u0026hellip; I did pinky swear.\u0026rdquo;\nJoy rose from the microscope and walked over to the tub, lifting it up.\n\u0026ldquo;Who is helping me to my plane?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\nDreams \u0026hellip; dreams \u0026hellip; nightmares. Images of mermaids and monsters swirled in his mind, and Manalo struggled awake. He felt nauseous as he blinked, trying to move, and his stomach lurched with each jolt of the yacht as it raced across the waves. He felt the pounding of the hull as it leapt from wave to wave. He tried to lift his head, but he could not. A shadow fell across his face, and he tried to turn, but found he could not. He could only blink. What the hell was wrong with his body, he wondered.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, good morning, sleepyhead,\u0026rdquo; Shen cooed as she lifted his head into her lap. \u0026ldquo;Here you go big boy, drink up.\u0026rdquo;\nManalo tasted something bitter on his tongue, and tried to spit it out, but the liquid poured down his throat, choking him. He sputtered, but swallowed it anyway, feeling an iron heaviness seep into his body.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll want today\u0026rsquo;s news, won\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo; Shen asked brightly. \u0026ldquo;It will be fun. I know that you\u0026rsquo;ve come to love our little sessions.\u0026rdquo;\nManalo\u0026rsquo;s memory snapped into focus even as his body felt even more dull and lifeless. He had lost track of time, but he knew that it had been several days since Shen seduced him into the water, and his whole life had turned upside down.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve made it to Hong Kong,\u0026rdquo; she said narrating as she began to wash his body with a sponge. \u0026ldquo;And we picked up Tuo\u0026rsquo;s brother. I can see why he wanted us to rescue him, poor thing. He\u0026rsquo;s a paraplegic, and you know that the Chinese don\u0026rsquo;t have much of a social safety net for handicapped people.\u0026rdquo;\nManalo seethed inside, unable to speak, unable to move. He could only blink and listen. He remembered lying on the sand as those strange creatures talked with Shen. Their story was incredible, but there they were, mermaids and a merman, and they had stung him again after several hours, keeping him paralyzed. The next day the mermaids loaded his still paralyzed body back onto the boat, and his nightmare had begun in earnest.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s too bad we didn\u0026rsquo;t bring more mermaid milk,\u0026rdquo; She continued, washing Manalo\u0026rsquo;s weakened body on the bed. \u0026ldquo;Wong is looking better, but he still can\u0026rsquo;t use his legs. At least he can feel his toes. He says that becoming a mer would make no difference to him because he has never had the use of his legs.\u0026rdquo;\nManalo struggled to remember Wong, but he was still nearly comatose when they neared Hong Kong. He could remember the long trip to Davao where Shen had given him yet another drug that allowed him to speak but prevented him the use of his limbs. He didn\u0026rsquo;t understand what her plans were, and so he had raved on and on about the sex she had denied him, which played into her plans perfectly.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think I should become a mermaid?\u0026rdquo; Shen asked, and then looked down at Manalo\u0026rsquo;s unmoving face. \u0026ldquo;What about you, eh? Would you like to become a mermaid or perhaps something else?\u0026rdquo;\nManalo felt fear stab through his gut as she rolled him over onto his stomach, continuing his bath. Shen\u0026rsquo;s confidence had improved with each step of her mission. He remembered the day she came back from the brothel with her sister and four other women in tow. The look in Shen\u0026rsquo;s face told him that he would not escape from the plan that had trapped him.\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to become a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Shen continued, squeezing out her sponge and working on Manalo\u0026rsquo;s legs. \u0026ldquo;There is something strangely powerful about them, and it scares me. But Dawn convinced me that your father would never let me escape, and my only hope was to disappear forever. And, thanks to the drugs that you use on your girls, mermaid milk was the only hope for my dear Lin,\u0026rdquo; she said, pinching him painfully on his butt.\n\u0026ldquo;Lin!\u0026rdquo; she called out.\n\u0026ldquo;Coming,\u0026rdquo; a voice answered.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s time for lunch, after all, and we need to get you ready for our return to Mermaid Island,\u0026rdquo; Shen said. \u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t have you wasting away to nothing, can we?\u0026rdquo;\nManalo fumed again over his lack of control. He replayed the last few weeks in his mind. First, he felt again his helplessness when he watched Tuo give her a million dollars of his own money, that is, his father\u0026rsquo;s money, several vials of mermaid poison, and several vials filled with mermaid milk. Then they headed for Davao, and Shen showed him the order \u0026ldquo;from\u0026rdquo; himself that had transferred Lin to Davao. A few days more, and they had arrived, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t look like Shen was going to run short of the Mermaid poison.\nWhen she went off to the brothel, leaving him alone on the boat, he hoped she would be unsuccessful, but even he was surprised at how quickly and easily the brothel\u0026rsquo;s manager had sold Shen\u0026rsquo;s sister and the four other women. Shen spent five thousand dollars to hire temporary muscle in Davao, and then a quarter of a million dollars for the \u0026ldquo;permanent use\u0026rdquo; of all five women. Manalo felt shame wash through him again as the sponge scrubbed his anus. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop himself from raving that day, and apparently he was very convincing as Shen\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;crazy boss.\u0026rdquo; The brothel\u0026rsquo;s manager watched, amazed, but had proved more than willing to take his father\u0026rsquo;s money.\n\u0026ldquo;Is our great leader ready for his lunch?\u0026rdquo; Lin asked as she walked into the room with a small bowl of pureed food.\n\u0026ldquo;Almost,\u0026rdquo; Shen answered smiling at her sister.\nLin had been ill-used by her time in various brothels owned by Malaki, but she recovered quickly thanks to the first dose of mermaid milk. The four other women that Shen rescued were also hostages, rather than local women who stumbled their way into prostitution. Manalo remembered the first time he saw the other women. They all looked at him with equal hatred, even though he was only personally responsible for Lin\u0026rsquo;s abduction. He thought they would simply dump him into the water as they carried his paralyzed body from his father\u0026rsquo;s boat to the new one they traded for in Hong Kong.\nThere was Binah, a Nigerian who had dreamed of becoming a dancer, whisked away to Asia when she was sixteen. Trixi was an American transvestite who had gone to Thailand for sex reassignment, but was kidnapped to satisfy the desires of those patrons who didn\u0026rsquo;t want the boy parts removed. Homa was a young Iranian, sold by her own father into a slavery ring because she had asked to go to school. Esmée was a young French prostitute, who had been vacationing with her family during the tsunami a few years ago, and the people who found her young body clutched to a palm tree decided not to find her family, selling her instead to the brothel.\nAll of the women showed scars from their time in the brothels. Shen had taken each one onto the boat to be \u0026ldquo;interviewed\u0026rdquo; by Manalo, but in reality, she explained that she could buy their freedom, but they would not be returning to civilization. Even as Manalo watched, from his prison of the bedroom, Shen promised them a new life, but would not say more about what kind of life it would be, only that she promised they would never again be subjected to the whims of men who used them for their bodies. The catch was their promise that they would not seek to return to their families no matter what. Each had agreed to the terms, some quite happily, like Homa. Other women would not accept Shen\u0026rsquo;s word or the promise of not returning to their families, so they decided to stay in Davao.\nOnce they were out to sea, Shen shared the truth with them, and while everyone was skeptical at first, to some the prospect of becoming a mermaid was exciting. Esmée was not excited. She seemed genuinely upset at the \u0026ldquo;trick\u0026rdquo; that had been played on her. Shen decided not to press the issue until they got back to Mermaid Island.\nManalo looked up at Lin\u0026rsquo;s face, now much improved thanks to her one small dose of mermaid milk. Shen promised Lin that she could decide Manalo\u0026rsquo;s fate, since he was the one who kidnapped her two years ago. Frankly, he was surprised that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t dead already, given the hatred he saw burning in her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Have you decided?\u0026rdquo; Shen asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Lin said, as she not too gently forced the mush into Manalo\u0026rsquo;s mouth, waiting for his esophageal reflex to kick in.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad you didn\u0026rsquo;t kill him outright,\u0026rdquo; Shen said, cleaning up her bath supplies.\n\u0026ldquo;I still might,\u0026rdquo; Lin said, looking into Manalo\u0026rsquo;s eyes as she put another spoonful into his mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;How are the others?\u0026rdquo; Shen asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Lin answered. \u0026ldquo;Trixi is driving me nuts, always asking when we will get to the island.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She just wants to be a woman, finally,\u0026rdquo; Shen said, remembering her shock when she discovered that the somewhat pretty American was actually a boy.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, maybe she\u0026rsquo;ll help Esmée get over her reluctance to become a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Lin said. \u0026ldquo;Maybe that is what I\u0026rsquo;ll make you into,\u0026rdquo; she said as she shoveled another mouthful into Manalo.\nLin sighed. She didn\u0026rsquo;t know if she could bring herself to make Manalo a mermaid. From what Shen explained about their beauty and power, she didn\u0026rsquo;t think it would be enough of a punishment for Manalo. One thing was certain; he was not going to remain a man.\nManalo watched as Lin put the next spoonful of mush into his mouth. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t taste anything, and he knew he should be worried about what she was going to do to him. But Manalo was fuming over all the money Shen had spent on gas. For the last few weeks, the yacht was moving at top speed nearly 18 hours a day \u0026hellip; they were going through ten or twenty thousand dollars worth of gas every few days. It was going to be a long, bumpy, and expensive trip back to Mermaid Island. His father, the old miser, was going to kill him.\n\u0026ldquo;Well?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, leaning over Tiaping\u0026rsquo;s shoulder as the Chinese scientist examined one of the fifteen small anemones in the tank.\n\u0026ldquo;This could save China, maybe even the world,\u0026rdquo; he said, not nearly believing his eyes. \u0026ldquo;Where did you get these specimens?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Trade secret,\u0026rdquo; Joy said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;You know better than to ask. So, they work just as promised. Oceans scrubbed clean by anemone. Are you prepared to help?\n\u0026ldquo;Oh yes, absolutely,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll start working on this right away. The commercial possibilities are enormous.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There will be no commercial possibilities with these little guys,\u0026rdquo; Joy said as she tapped the Plexiglas tank. \u0026ldquo;These will be released into the wild now that we know they are stable, safe, and do what they were designed to do. After all the agreements are in place, we can talk about what new developments you and your country would like to sponsor, and THOSE inventions can have commercial possibilities.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course, there is too much at stake with our oceans,\u0026rdquo; Taiping said, polishing his glasses with his shirtsleeve. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean to suggest that I \u0026hellip; er \u0026hellip; we would sell these animals to the rest of the world.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course you didn\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be getting back to you in two days. You\u0026rsquo;ll let me know what progress you\u0026rsquo;ve made.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, of course,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;I will be discrete.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, Taiping, you have always been the soul of tact,\u0026rdquo; she said smiling.\nIt was a beautiful morning in the nursery.\nBy the time that Pat had delivered her daughter, Maureen, nearly two years, four months and twenty-eight days after John and Patrick had first arrived on the island, all the other expectant mothers had also delivered (except for Alexis). Xing had delivered first, a few days after Joy had left. Bao (treasure) was lovely little mermaid with a mottled green and black tail and silver highlights along her fringes. She had her mother\u0026rsquo;s almond shaped eyes, but their color was Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s deep violet. Danni had been next, and Freya practically burst from her womb in only an hour. Freya was a golden blond, like her mother, and her tail was blue with gold highlights, the compliment to Danni\u0026rsquo;s golden tail with blue highlights.\nPhoebe had a long labor, and Pat had started her own midway through Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s labor. John had been in a near panic, but all the mers were there to support the multiple births. Cynthia had frosty blue/gray eyes, blending her mother and father\u0026rsquo;s characteristics, and a matching silver-blue tail with dramatic black highlights along her tiny flukes and fins. Finally, Maureen sashayed into the world, last but not least. She had the same red hair and green eyes as her mother, Pat, but she had a Kelly green tail with white highlights.\nNow, only a week later, all the newest mermaids were growing quickly, and the pain and trauma of childbirth was a fading memory. Little Michelle, who was only three months old, was already making out words. Mari was not far behind her.\n\u0026ldquo;How many children do you think can fit in here?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked, her hand resting unconsciously on her own still flat belly.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, looking around at all the mothers and children playing in the water. \u0026ldquo;I would say at least a few more, especially yours.\u0026rdquo;\nAlexis blushed.\n\u0026ldquo;Michelle is maturing quickly,\u0026rdquo; she noted as they watched Petra play the eye, ear, nose game with her child. \u0026ldquo;Those tests we ran seem to confirm your original hypothesis.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What hypothesis did she make now?\u0026rdquo; John asked, putting his arm around Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;That our children will mature in about half the time as humans do,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, holding Maureen to her breast, watching her daughter suckle on her nipple.\n\u0026ldquo;That puts puberty at about six or seven years old,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe mused, doing the math.\n\u0026ldquo;You mean that we could be grandparents in another six or seven years?\u0026rdquo; John asked, aghast.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a possibility,\u0026rdquo; Pat mused as she watched Maureen feed. She had never anticipated becoming a mother, especially not when she was a man. Being a grandmother was still beyond her comprehension. However, now that she had experienced motherhood, and the strong hormones and electro-currents that bonded mother to daughter, she knew that she would have more. Not soon, but someday.\n\u0026ldquo;Just think, we\u0026rsquo;ll be twenty-two year old grandparents,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe wondered aloud as she held her daughter Cynthia to her breast.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you mean thirty-year old grandparents?\u0026rdquo; John asked. \u0026ldquo;We are talking another six or seven years, here, and six plus twenty-four is still thirty where I come from.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Have you forgotten already?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Forgotten what?\u0026rdquo; asked John, looking completely confused as he moved from Danni to Phoebe to Pat, sharing the fish he had brought down from the \u0026ldquo;kitchen cave\u0026rdquo; to the \u0026ldquo;nursery cave.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That we are aging ten thousand times slower than normal, according to the new\u0026ndash;and definitive\u0026ndash;tests that Galina and Alexis completed,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, switching her daughter to her other breast as she took the fresh fish from John and nibbled on one end. \u0026ldquo;Looks like my hypothesis was right; we won\u0026rsquo;t actually live forever.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ten thousand times slower?\u0026rdquo; he asked, incredulous.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, we will live to be around one hundred thousand years old,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe answered, feeling utter contentment as her daughter pulled at her nipple, eating her fill.\nJohn looked at his now growing pod, and tried to assimilate all the changes that were happening to his life. His life-mate and oldest friend Patricia (formerly Patrick), was now a beautiful redheaded mermaid with a sea-green tail that had pink highlights on her fins and flukes, and flashing green eyes. She held Maureen, a name in Irish that meant \u0026ldquo;born of the sea,\u0026rdquo; who was a near copy of her mother, with red hair, green eyes, a green tail but it had white highlights, rather than her mother\u0026rsquo;s pink. His heart nearly broke as he gazed on the lovely sight of mother and daughter in the shallow water of the nursery pool.\nNext to her, Danni, formerly Daniel, sat with Freya, a name that meant Beauty from the ancient Norse, a nod to Danni\u0026rsquo;s Nordic looks, who had a pale blue tail with gold highlights that matched her mother\u0026rsquo;s tail, her mother\u0026rsquo;s blue eyes, and the same golden hair as her mother\u0026rsquo;s. The look in Danni\u0026rsquo;s eyes as she watched her daughter feed from her large, long nipples told John that he had suddenly moved another notch down in the attention chain of command as far as Danni was concerned.\nFinally, Phoebe rested comfortably with the last of his daughters, Cynthia, whose name meant Moon, which was an unintentional irony because Phoebe gave birth at midnight in the Moon Pool during a full moon. Cynthia\u0026rsquo;s coloring also ironically matched her name, with a silver-blue tail with shadowy dark gray fringes, gray-blue eyes, and her mother\u0026rsquo;s white blonde hair.\nAll of them were beautiful, and all of them had been born within hours of one another. Nearby, Xing and Bao lounged comfortably; the little mermaid was sound asleep on her mother\u0026rsquo;s tail, resting between Xing\u0026rsquo;s mid-tail fins. Next to her, Michelle clambered over Petra\u0026rsquo;s reclined body; the three-month-old mermaid was trying to braid her mother\u0026rsquo;s hair. In the pool, Liga and Mari played together, each touching eyes, then ears, and then noses as Liga repeated the names of each. Mari didn\u0026rsquo;t have the right sounds put together yet like Michelle, but she clearly understood her mother\u0026rsquo;s promptings, easily identifying her nose, lips, eyes, and ears.\nJohn, still reeling over the news that he was practically immortal, looked over all his girls. He wondered what would happen if the mer population kept growing.\n\u0026ldquo;If we are going to live that long,\u0026rdquo; he worried, \u0026ldquo;we can\u0026rsquo;t keep on having kids. We\u0026rsquo;ll over-populate the seas.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll see,\u0026rdquo; Pat said mysteriously. \u0026ldquo;The sea is a really big place, you know, and the land mass of Earth, which is actually a much smaller ecosystem, now supports some six billion people. I think the sea can handle a few million mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Especially if we keep discovering ways to help both the sea and humanity,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe boasted, switching Cynthia to her other breast as her one-week-old daughter fed hungrily.\nAlexis popped her head up from the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a boat on the horizon,\u0026rdquo; she warned. \u0026ldquo;We need everyone in the Moon Pool.\n\u0026ldquo;You want me to take my vacation now?\u0026rdquo; Mac sputtered, stumbling to a stop in front of the gleaming office building where he had been walking.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Joy urged, her voice a distant crackle over the phone. \u0026ldquo;Trust me; I\u0026rsquo;ll make it worth your time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You won\u0026rsquo;t tell me anything about your recent trip,\u0026rdquo; he complained into the cheap, disposable cell phone, trying to hold it steady in his hammock-like hands. Even at 64 years old, he was still a man where you could not ignore his physical prowess. \u0026ldquo;You won\u0026rsquo;t tell me what my daughter said to you, and you won\u0026rsquo;t go to Paris with me!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be in Paris,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, smiling at his bluster. \u0026ldquo;It could be in paradise.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Paradise, huh?\u0026rdquo; Mac groused. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll see about that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Does that mean that you\u0026rsquo;re coming?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I have to travel civilian?\u0026rdquo; he grumbled.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, you cheapskate,\u0026rdquo; she teased. \u0026ldquo;You have to go on vacation! This cannot be an official trip. Hell, Mac, you haven\u0026rsquo;t taken a vacation in decades; you must have at least two years saved up. You can take two weeks!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No I can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;Someone will figure out that I\u0026rsquo;m not acting normally, and all this cloak and dagger stuff will come crashing down. Are you sure Sally isn\u0026rsquo;t doing anything illegal?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tell your boss that I made you an offer you couldn\u0026rsquo;t refuse, and that I would distract you from your recent fight with your daughter,\u0026rdquo; she said in a seductive tone. All those years in the field insured that her voice could melt steel when necessary.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a fight with Sally,\u0026rdquo; he said, hearing the promise in Joy\u0026rsquo;s voice. Few thirty-year old women could bring Mac to his knees, but Joy, even at sixty, was a different species. She still turned the heads of men half her age.\n\u0026ldquo;Mac \u0026hellip; quit stalling,\u0026rdquo; she breathed.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll \u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ll be there in two weeks,\u0026rdquo; he said with a sigh.\n\u0026ldquo;Make it two days,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Joy, you\u0026rsquo;re not being—\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Two days, Mac,\u0026rdquo; she said, smiling, knowing how his face looked at that very moment. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll see you in two days. Suva. Bring a swimsuit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Bring a swimsuit?\u0026rdquo; Mac blustered, but the connection ended.\n\u0026ldquo;Good Tutu, good Tutu,\u0026rdquo; Emma said as she stroked the long, gray dolphin.\nThe former male islander now a female dolphin squawked happily, tossing her head up and down. Just as the mers had hoped, the new dolphin was indeed a pet dog, of sorts. She was much brighter than the average dog, she was even brighter than the average dolphin, able to understand complete sentences, and more importantly, she deeply bonded to her creators: Pat, Alexis, Galina, Phoebe, and Emma. She avoided Ragi and Timi, the two new Polynesian mermaids who were originally (his) former cousins, and she generally ignored the other mers unless they were with one of the pod-mates who had created her. If Danni was with Pat, Tutu would acknowledge Danni with something passing for interest. However, if any of the five women who created her called her or stroked her, Tutu practically buzzed with happiness.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s really cute,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said, stroking the other side of Tutu. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t wait until she has her first calf.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Give it time. It\u0026rsquo;s only been a few days since Tutu got out here,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;Like us, dolphins live in pods, and female dolphins are very protective of their males.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why does she have calves and we have babies?\u0026rdquo; Rikki mused.\n\u0026ldquo;Because neither one of us have fry,\u0026rdquo; Emma said.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said. \u0026ldquo;Only fish have fry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Duh,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s my point, sis.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You two stop. Pay attention to Tutu. She\u0026rsquo;s a lovely dolphin,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said. \u0026ldquo;Why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t she have a boyfriend already?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re incorrigible,\u0026rdquo; Emma sighed. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re always dreaming of romance.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And aren\u0026rsquo;t you glad we\u0026rsquo;ve found it?\u0026rdquo; Cleo reminded her sister wife with a big kiss that curled both their tails.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, yes,\u0026rdquo; Emma sighed. \u0026ldquo;But we are only supposed to check in briefly with Tutu and give her the instructions.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said, taking over. \u0026ldquo;Tutu, go to the deep water, over there,\u0026rdquo; she continued, pointing to the north side of the island. \u0026ldquo;Come back tomorrow. We have strangers coming, and you need to hide.\u0026rdquo;\nTutu rolled onto her side, waving a pectoral flipper at the girls, signaling her acceptance of the order. She ducked beneath the waves with a flip of her gray flukes, so much smaller than the mermaid\u0026rsquo;s nearly meter wide flukes. In the few weeks that Emma and her sisters had been working with Tutu, they had begun to get a real sense of dolphin speech. It was sort of like talking to a ten year old. All the words were there, but the complex thoughts were not. Emma secretly hoped that they could begin to learn to understand and speak \u0026ldquo;dolphin.\u0026rdquo;\nMuSu surfaced a few meters away.\n\u0026ldquo;The boat\u0026rsquo;s getting closer, we should get back to the caves,\u0026rdquo; he reminded everyone.\nThe girls all nodded, and together the pod disappeared beneath the surface of the water.\nGabriel and Galina bobbed in the lagoon, surveying the beach. They had hidden most of the evidence of their presence after Joy had left, and they knew the boat was still many miles out. Tuo and his pod would catch up with the boat in another hour and try to identify if it was a friend or foe. Everyone hoped it would be Shen Chin and her girls.\nAs they bobbed in the water, they sensed a jet flying high above the island. There were electromagnetic signals emanating from the jet that marked it as something other than a normal commercial jetliner. Mermaid Island was not under any major flight paths for airplanes, so any airplane was unusual. This plane was very unusual.\n\u0026ldquo;Should we find cover?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked, squinting into the sky. The jet was a mere dot in the blue expanse of the sky, the long wispy trails of vapor clouds trailing behind.\n\u0026ldquo;We look like people in the water, and that\u0026rsquo;s nothing we need to hide,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said. \u0026ldquo;Can you make anything of the plane?\u0026rdquo;\nGalina closed her eyes and concentrated. She could sense the approaching boat, still a ways off, but of the airplane, without the benefit of water transmitting signals to her mer-senses, it was just a blip in the sky.\n\u0026ldquo;No, nothing,\u0026rdquo; she said, shading her eyes with her hand as she tried to will herself to see fifty thousand feet into the air.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll just wait until it passes,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said, watching the plane arc across the sky for several minutes. When it finally reached the horizon, he nodded to Galina, and they both flipped back under the water to prepare for the approaching boat.\nTrixi leaned over the railing of the yacht, feeling the wind and spray tug at her hair and skin, letting the fine mist of water that sprang up from the bow wash over her cheeks and lips. She leaned into Homa who was standing next to her, feeling the warmth of the dark Iranian beauty against her skin. The two \u0026ldquo;women\u0026rdquo; could not have been more opposite. Trixi was coltish, lean, with slim hips, long legs, and broad shoulders. Her face was pretty, but not beautiful. She accomplished her feminine look through her posture, clothes, and effort rather than through her genetics. Trixi\u0026rsquo;s spirit was feminine, but her body had been born a male.\nHoma, on the other hand, was a classic beauty, and the first dose of mermaid milk had restored the glow to her cheeks, the luster to her long, dark, curly hair, and flesh to her womanly frame. Homa was shorter than Trixi, and had an hourglass figure, her hazel eyes flecked with gold, and her generous smile showed a new tooth working its way up from her lower jaw, a gift of the mermaid milk. Homa, however, was not a timid or shy woman, and her fierceness practically glowed from behind her flickering eyes.\nTrixi smiled back at Homa, worried that her stubble would show. While the mermaid milk had restored her health, it had also restored parts of her original gender. She had been a transsexual prostitute for the last few years, and it was a miracle that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t already dead. Men used and abused her by the thousands, and she was sure she had several STD\u0026rsquo;s. Her new employers never had her boy parts removed, despite her desperate desire to do so. They had simply relied on the chemical castration and female hormones that she had already been using. When she understood what mermaid milk would eventually do, Trixi wept with joy. She would finally be female, after all these years of waiting. Now, several weeks later, she worried that she had become too mannish.\n\u0026ldquo;Do not worry yourself,\u0026rdquo; Homa said, reading the look in Trixi\u0026rsquo;s eyes. \u0026ldquo;You will always be my Trixi. It will be alright.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Homa,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said in her soft alto, nearly effortless with her many years of practice. \u0026ldquo;I hope so. I really, really hope so. How much longer until we get there?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Today,\u0026rdquo; said Shen as she walked forward along the deck.\n\u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Really,\u0026rdquo; Shen said with a smile.\nShe glanced back at Binah who was grinning like a little girl as she held the yacht\u0026rsquo;s wheel in her hands. Binah towered above all of them, a tall and graceful girl from Nigeria. Five years as a prostitute had obliterated her beauty. But the mermaid milk, as per Tuo\u0026rsquo;s promises, had done its work on her as well. Now, Binah glowed in the morning sun, her dark skin shinning a deep chocolate brown.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure you don\u0026rsquo;t want to drive?\u0026rdquo; Shen asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do anything that might be considered male.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Steering the boat is a man\u0026rsquo;s job?\u0026rdquo; Homa challenged.\n\u0026ldquo;Homa,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said fearfully, \u0026ldquo;You spent your childhood struggling to be the equal of a man, but never to become one. I spent my childhood struggling to become a woman, not merely the equal of one. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to go back into being a man again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Men are scum,\u0026rdquo; Homa spat, agreeing.\n\u0026ldquo;Not all men,\u0026rdquo; Shen observed, remembering her reaction to Tuo\u0026rsquo;s dramatic transformation. It was too bad that he already had his own pod, she thought, but he had promised that she would have a new pod with her sister. \u0026ldquo;If what Tuo said was true, we will help create our new mates.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Men are still scum,\u0026rdquo; Homa said. \u0026ldquo;I will never forget the thousands of men who have used me, starting with my father, the bastard!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps mermen will be different,\u0026rdquo; Trixi urged. \u0026ldquo;You promised you would try, for my sake.\u0026rdquo;\nHoma turned to look her lover squarely in the eye. They became lovers several months ago, when they were both transported to Davao, a backwater brothel that signified that their usefulness as prostitutes was nearly done. They often killed the girls there in \u0026ldquo;snuff\u0026rdquo; fantasies or sold them into permanent bondage. Both girls thought their lives were over, and up until their first doses of mermaid milk, they felt like they were dying, both of them were so sick and abused. Despite their suffering, Homa seemed fascinated by this lady-boy, a man who wanted to become a woman so badly that he risked everything to become one. Unfortunately for Trixi, she had been kidnapped before she could finish her transition.\n\u0026ldquo;For your sake only,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Ugh, the thought of being a man\u0026rsquo;s servant, even a merman\u0026rsquo;s, makes my stomach churn.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But you and I can share a pod mate,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, always worried by the vehemence she saw in Homa\u0026rsquo;s feelings towards men. \u0026ldquo;We will be lovers in every way that we\u0026rsquo;ve always wished.\u0026rdquo;\nAlthough Trixi and Homa were lovers, they had never attempted intercourse. At first, Trixi simply couldn\u0026rsquo;t. Her body wasted away by disease, her hormones irregular and dangerous, both of them sought primarily physical comfort and emotional bonding, not sex after all the clients had finished with them. After the mermaid milk healed both of them, at least partially, Trixi\u0026rsquo;s very small hard on was a \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; surprise. Homa was both fascinated and horrified, but she could not bring herself to touch it. They limited themselves to cuddling, kissing, and a rare mutual masturbation.\n\u0026ldquo;We shall see,\u0026rdquo; Homa said simply, dismissing the matter.\n\u0026ldquo;How are Esmée and Wong doing?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked Shen.\n\u0026ldquo;Better,\u0026rdquo; she answered, looking behind her through one of the yacht\u0026rsquo;s windows. \u0026ldquo;Wong is at least in good spirits, even if he still can\u0026rsquo;t use his legs, but Esmée won\u0026rsquo;t leave her room. I wish we had more milk.\u0026rdquo;\nTrixi nodded, secretly happy there wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough milk to really heal everyone. She didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be \u0026ldquo;cured\u0026rdquo; of her maleness any more than she already was. Esmée, on the other hand, needed more. She was probably a real beauty, but it was hard to tell. The abuse to her was horrific, and scars covered her face, neck, and torso. They burned off one of her ears, and a long jagged scar ran down her face from her hairline down to her collarbone. The tiny dose of mermaid milk had helped, but she still had a long way to go. In the meantime, she was self-conscious and refused to leave the cabin she shared with Binah. Shen hoped that more mermaid milk would restore not only Esmée\u0026rsquo;s looks but also her self-confidence. Wong, on the other hand, was born a paraplegic, and it would likely take strong doses of mermaid milk to heal his legs and spinal column.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you planning to do with Manalo?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to let Lin decide,\u0026rdquo; Shen said, smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;How is Tuo\u0026rsquo;s brother?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Better,\u0026rdquo; Shen answered, her face darkening. \u0026ldquo;He looks better, but he still can\u0026rsquo;t get out of the wheel chair. I can\u0026rsquo;t believe that his family abandoned him that way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m more impressed that Tuo thought to rescue him in this way,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;Chinese culture\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t tell me about Chinese culture,\u0026rdquo; Shen snapped, a rare flash of anger. \u0026ldquo;I grew up fighting those same parts of Chinese culture. Girls get treated worse than paraplegics; at least most of them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then, we both have something to look forward to when we get to Mermaid Island,\u0026rdquo; Trixi finished, watching the sea churn in the bow.\nSudhish looked again at the message from Ms. Chin, puzzled. According to the email from the staff worker in Malaki\u0026rsquo;s call center, the radiophone call had originated in Hong Kong, which was not near the coordinates of Tumibay\u0026rsquo;s last message. The previous one from Ms. Chin was from Davao. Surely, she knew that her locations were traceable, he thought to himself. If she and Manalo had found Alberto and the money, then why did she go to that part of the Philippines and then onto Hong Kong? They should be flying back to Malaysia from Suva, not taking the boat hundreds of kilometers to one of their least important business holdings in Davao and then north to Hong Kong.\nHe printed the message and put it in the pile of papers to take into Malaki\u0026rsquo;s office.\nHe wondered, briefly, which of her family members Malaki was holding in some hellhole, and if Ms. Chin\u0026rsquo;s sister and his own were sharing a prison cell. Where were they holding Ms. Chin\u0026rsquo;s sister? Surely, he could access some business records. His orders were only to not look up any information on his own sister. He knew that if he was caught trying to locate his sister, both of them would be killed. Someone else, however, was different.\nHe decided to take a chance, and pulled up records for Shen Chin. The computer screen blinked a few times, and then showed a \u0026ldquo;no electronic records available\u0026rdquo; icon. That meant that the files were in the very room in which he sat, Sudhish guessed. Nearly all the \u0026ldquo;illegal\u0026rdquo; files in Malaki\u0026rsquo;s vast business empire were only decipherable in this office. The electronic records were all code for what was really going on. It would take time, but at least Sudhish could do something.\nEsmée sat on her bunk, peering out the tiny window at the lagoon in which they had finally stopped. Surrounding the boat were a collection of the most beautiful creatures she had ever seen. When Shen first explained that they would become mermaids, she was afraid. Sea creatures? But these mermaids and mermen were stunning, captivating, and heavenly. Their bodies sparkled with color, strength, and health. Their silvery laughter sounded like angelic music, and she felt herself filled with a strange longing, one that before she had never felt.\nShe rose from the bunk and looked into the small mirror next to the door to the cabin. Everyone else was up on deck, shouting and laughing, introducing themselves to the crowd of mermaids that were swimming around the boat. Her face, still pocked with scars, her left ear still missing, showed some tissue that had begun to grow back. She traced the long, deep, scar that ran from above her left eye down to her right clavicle, marring her nose and lips as it continued its jagged march down her face to her neck. She used to be so beautiful; the prettiest girl in her small town. When they first captured her after the tsunami, she took comfort in being the prettiest prostitute in the brothel.\nHe had been a crazy man; Spanish, she thought, though he could have been from South America. In one horrible night, her looks and her life were forever changed. Well, maybe not forever, she thought to herself. Now, these beautiful creatures beckoned to her, promising a new life, a new beauty. She smiled at herself, which she knew was a particularly horrific sight, her lower lip flapping, but she squared her shoulders anyway and walked out of the cabin for the first time since she boarded the boat nearly a month ago.\nAs she walked up onto the deck, blinking in the intensity of the bright sunlight, she heard the laughter of the mermaids. She saw an opening along the rail next to Binah, and sidled up to her, looking out into the water. A lovely mermaid with long red hair smiled up to her even as a very small mermaid, who also had red hair, flipped over her shoulder, dropping to her breasts that bobbled just beneath the surface of the water, and apparently began feeding on one.\n\u0026ldquo;You must be Esmée,\u0026rdquo; the mermaid greeted her. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m Pat, and this is my daughter Maureen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Bon jour,\u0026rdquo; Esmée said nervously. \u0026ldquo;I sorry about my fa \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be sorry about a thing, my dear,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with conviction. \u0026ldquo;We will, if we can, make who ever did that to you sorry. Now, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to hear another word about it. I assume Shen told you about mer senses?\u0026rdquo;\nEsmée nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;Then you can believe me when I tell you that you, my dear, are a very beautiful person.\u0026rdquo;\nEsmée nearly fainted with relief, and choked back a sob. Binah put an arm around her.\n\u0026ldquo;See,\u0026rdquo; Binah said in her Nigerian accent. \u0026ldquo;Beauty is more than skin.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But zey are \u0026hellip; how you say,\u0026rdquo; Esmée said, nodding at the many mermaids and mermen that surrounded the boat. \u0026ldquo;Ils sont très beaux.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And soon you will be too,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, holding her daughter to her breast. \u0026ldquo;Soon you will be beautiful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Comment savez-vous le français?\u0026rdquo; Esmée asked.\n\u0026ldquo;J\u0026rsquo;ai appris le français dans le lycée,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered.\nAt least one mermaid spoke French, Esmée thought to her self. As she looked at Pat, watching her daughter float just below the surface, her small body wrapped around her mother\u0026rsquo;s waist, apparently not needing to breathe the air, Esmée felt her heart catch. She wanted to be that loved, she wanted to be that beautiful, and she wanted to be that completely different from what she had been for most of her life.\n\u0026ldquo;Binah,\u0026rdquo; she gushed, turning to her bunkmate. \u0026ldquo;Nous allons être des sirènes!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Binah said, smiling, her white teeth flashing. \u0026ldquo;We ARE going to be Sirens of the Sea.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are we going to do with this boat?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked as she waddled back to the stern. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the nicest yacht I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been on.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we don\u0026rsquo;t need boats,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re mers, and we can swim faster than this silly boat goes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I know,\u0026rdquo; Emma said testily. \u0026ldquo;We just can\u0026rsquo;t keep sinking them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not going to do anything with this boat for the moment,\u0026rdquo; Alexis chided them as she helped Sally unload the last of the supplies that Shen had brought back from Hong Kong. \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you two grab those boxes over there and get them back to the lab cave.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are we done?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked from the water near the boat.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Alexis answered, hoisting herself up onto the railing. \u0026ldquo;Ugh, I may not look pregnant, but I feel pregnant. Look out below!\u0026rdquo;\nAlexis flipped over down to the water; doing a prefect \u0026ldquo;can opener,\u0026rdquo; tail first, a big spout of water arching back onto the boat. Shen giggled, even as she struggled to keep her face out of the water.\n\u0026ldquo;You alright?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked, holding Shen\u0026rsquo;s elbow, trying to help her stay afloat.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I am fine,\u0026rdquo; she sputtered. \u0026ldquo;Manalo is safely stowed?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, he\u0026rsquo;s back in the caves, and when the poison wears off, he will be stuck in an underwater cave with no exit other than a long tunnel he can\u0026rsquo;t swim through without our help.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get back to the beach,\u0026rdquo; Shen said.\nGalina slipped beneath the surface and put her head between Shen\u0026rsquo;s legs, and then slowly built up speed, pushing Shen through the water like a kick board. Shen laughed with delight as she surfed towards the beach, feeling the strong mermaid below her lift her in the water. She was still giggling as she joined the small crowd of people and mers on the beach.\nAs she walked up onto the wide sand, she noticed that everyone\u0026rsquo;s attention was directed to the southern sky, and as she turned, she heard the whine of an airplane, an old prop driven plane. As she squeezed the water from her long, dark hair, she watched with the others as the plane approached.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Joy,\u0026rdquo; Sally announced, and the newcomers nodded with recognition. The mers had spent the last several hours filling in the history and situation to Shen\u0026rsquo;s girls and Tuo\u0026rsquo;s brother.\n\u0026ldquo;It will be alright,\u0026rdquo; Eric told her, putting his arm around his mate.\n\u0026ldquo;I hope so,\u0026rdquo; Sally said, her nervousness visible to everyone.\nJoy circled the plane once around the mers, waving the wings, and then expertly swooped down into the lagoon, coming to a rest near the anchored yacht. As the propeller slowly spun itself out, the door over the pontoon popped open, and a large man with white hair emerged from the plane and stood on the pontoon, gaping at what he saw on the beach. After a brief moment, a feminine foot shot out from the plane, caught the man squarely in the shoulders, and pushed him into the water.\nMac surfaced easily and swam with quick, sure strokes towards the beach. Even though Joy had tried to prepare him for his first sight of the mers, nothing came close to actually seeing these incredible creatures first hand. As he stroked towards the beach, hearing Joy letting out the anchor on the seaplane, he remembered his disbelief when Joy first explained it to him.\nJoy at first refused to give him any details about his daughter or the place where they were going. When he arrived in Suva, they had a romantic dinner, and then went back to the hotel room for their long awaited tryst. Joy\u0026rsquo;s promise of dinner in paradise with all the trimmings was indeed worth the nearly forty-year wait. Afterwards, they went down to the hotel\u0026rsquo;s pool for a late night swim to wash the sweat and sex from their bodies. As she curled up into his arms, looking so beautiful in the moonlight, she explained that his daughter had become a mermaid.\nImpossible. He was stunned and silent, Joy prodding him for some reaction. They had returned to bed, but Mac appeared troubled by dreams and nightmares. As the time approached for him to see his changed daughter, he felt a great fear build in his heart. During the long plane ride out to the island, Joy tried to fill him in as much as possible, filling his silence with her talk. Although he listened to her, one thought kept repeating itself in his mind: a mermaid—not human\u0026ndash;impossible!\nAs he looked over the approaching beach, the impossible now seemed incredible—even beautiful—maybe even divine. He found the bottom with his hands and stopped swimming. Rising, he could see his daughter\u0026rsquo;s face, looking at him fearfully as she watched him stride onto the sand. He felt for a moment like Macarthur, striding up a similar beach over fifty years ago. But the tenderness he saw in Sally\u0026rsquo;s face pushed that image from his mind. She was next to Eric, and both of their royal blue tails extended perpendicularly backwards from their erect torsos. How could she do that? Her brown hair fell around her shoulders and demurely covered her breasts, which even her father could see were more substantial than they once had been. She looked lovely, younger, and something else. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t name it.\n\u0026ldquo;Daddy?\u0026rdquo; she said apprehensively.\nMac continued his silent march towards his daughter, all the mers watching as father and mer-daughter met for the first time. Eric, Sally, and two other mermaids that Joy had explained were now Sally\u0026rsquo;s sister-wives were near the back of the mers, so Mac had to walk through all of them. He held is face in a neutral expression, his years of training coming to the fore.\nHe stood before his daughter, who was now nearly trembling with worry and slowly sank to his knees. Wordlessly he reached out and offered a hug to his daughter, and with a small whimper, she fell into his embrace. They hugged fiercely for several minutes.\n\u0026ldquo;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe it when Joy told me,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re angry,\u0026rdquo; she whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he said, lifting her away so that he could see her face. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m surprised, but not angry. Joy has told me a lot in the last twentyfour hours, and I think there is still a lot we need to know. But I\u0026rsquo;m not angry. Are you happy?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Daddy,\u0026rdquo; she said smiling, her eyes watering. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t tell you how happy I am, especially now that you\u0026rsquo;re here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;m not here yet \u0026hellip; and I have no idea what we are going to do,\u0026rdquo; he said, turning as Joy settled down beside him. \u0026ldquo;But Joy has lots of plans.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see that Shen and the girls made it back safely,\u0026rdquo; Joy observed. \u0026ldquo;Have you made any plans for their transition?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Sally answered. \u0026ldquo;The math doesn\u0026rsquo;t work out, unless Dad wants to start a pod.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not in the plan,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Yet,\u0026rdquo; she finished after a smile and a wink to Mac. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the situation?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We have six willing women, one willing man, and one half of a full pod,\u0026rdquo; Sally summarized.\n\u0026ldquo;So, the math does work if I start a pod,\u0026rdquo; Mac observed. \u0026ldquo;If you become a mermaid too, that would leave one pod one mermaid short of full.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You were paying attention,\u0026rdquo; Joy teased.\n\u0026ldquo;I usually pay attention,\u0026rdquo; Mac protested. \u0026ldquo;How do you think I got to be an Admiral?\u0026rdquo;\nLater that afternoon, Mac watched as the mers scrambled off the beach, trying to hide from what was obviously a spy plane flying far above their heads.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not one of ours,\u0026rdquo; he observed, peering out from one of the huts. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s too low.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Russians?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe,\u0026rdquo; he answered. \u0026ldquo;They might not be looking for the mers. They could be looking for their sub.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right, their submarine!\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;It went down a few hundred nautical miles from here, and any methodical sweep of the area would bring them over this island.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why did they wait so long before searching with their spy planes?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked. \u0026ldquo;That sub went down almost a year ago.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They didn\u0026rsquo;t know where or when it went down,\u0026rdquo; Joy answered. \u0026ldquo;Galina and Alexis, you remember who they are? Good. They told me that the sub was in complete blackout. There was no radio contact of any kind for the previous two months. The Russians may not even know that the sub went down.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes they do,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, thinking. \u0026ldquo;No sub is out for that long with out contact of some kind. They started searching for a reason.\u0026rdquo;\nThey both watched the slow progress of the spy plane across the sky. Near the horizon, it made a long arc to the west, and then headed back to the island, now coming directly overhead.\n\u0026ldquo;Sally\u0026rsquo;s Blackgate,\u0026rdquo; Mac said suddenly. \u0026ldquo;She was trying to hide the mers, but we must have had a security leak. Someone in our military told the Russians about the newly declared classified zone, and they must have assumed it was for their sub.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They would be half right,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Their sub, or at least what\u0026rsquo;s left of it, is just outside this zone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They may or may not find it, but if they do, they will be pretty angry that their sub was salvaged without so much as a how-de-do,\u0026rdquo; he said worriedly. \u0026ldquo;We need to think of some way to warn both the American military and the Russians that their sub was not harvested by a military agency.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uh, excuse me?\u0026rdquo; Joy said, teasingly. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re practically on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I think the American military has been warned.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Mac said thoughtfully. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve just resigned.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You what?\u0026rdquo; Joy said flabbergasted.\n\u0026ldquo;Resigned,\u0026rdquo; he said walking out onto the sand. \u0026ldquo;I think that it\u0026rsquo;s time that I retire, don\u0026rsquo;t you? I have to retire next year; it\u0026rsquo;s mandatory. I\u0026rsquo;ll be sixty-two.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Will you get back in here?\u0026rdquo; Joy demanded. \u0026ldquo;The Russians have perfectly good cameras, and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to blow cover yet. You are easily recognizable.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not blowing cover,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;We are ON vacation, remember. We are supposed to be here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In a Blackgate area?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my vacation is cover for my investigation,\u0026rdquo; he said smiling. \u0026ldquo;Now, move your ass out here, kiss me, and act like we are on vacation!\u0026rdquo;\nJoy shook her head and walked out to Mac, hearing the distant whine of the airplane overhead. She put her arms around his broad shoulders and shook her own white hair in the sunlight.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the mers, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo; she asked. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re retiring be with the mers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do you know it\u0026rsquo;s not my daughter?\u0026rdquo; he protested. \u0026ldquo;I do love my own daughter, you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So do I,\u0026rdquo; she said, kissing him. \u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;ve never let your career get in the way of loving your daughter.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That was a low blow,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Neither did I,\u0026rdquo; Joy admitted. \u0026ldquo;Sally\u0026rsquo;s turned out alright, no thanks to either of us. But what I\u0026rsquo;m saying is that there is something about the mers; something that just gets to you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What, you mean like Odysseus and the Sirens?\u0026rdquo; Mac said, thinking about his feelings when he first saw the mers.\n\u0026ldquo;Something like that,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s magical, though, or at least it isn\u0026rsquo;t some power in their voices.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that plane isn\u0026rsquo;t being very stealthy,\u0026rdquo; Mac observed, looking up at the dot in the sky. He lowered his gaze saw the look in Joy\u0026rsquo;s face that told him he had interrupted. \u0026ldquo;Sorry. I am listening. If the mers are not like the ancient Greek sirens, what gives them this power of attraction that we feel?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;d be surprised at how scientifically oriented these mers actually are,\u0026rdquo; Joy said by way of an answer. \u0026ldquo;Pat is practically a scientific genius, and Alexis and Galina aren\u0026rsquo;t far behind. They have probably been working on a solution. Hey, you\u0026rsquo;re right, that plane is actually circling this island.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Russian training has gone down the fucking tubes,\u0026rdquo; Mac only half joked. \u0026ldquo;Their pilots don\u0026rsquo;t get to spend nearly enough time in the air. Let\u0026rsquo;s make this one session with their camera that they won\u0026rsquo;t forget,\u0026rdquo; he said, squeezing her butt.\n\u0026ldquo;I think I know what you\u0026rsquo;re up to. Let\u0026rsquo;s give them a real show?\u0026rdquo; she giggled, tugging on his shorts.\n\u0026ldquo;You are awfully randy for an old lady,\u0026rdquo; he teased. \u0026ldquo;What about Shen\u0026rsquo;s girls and my daughter?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Shen\u0026rsquo;s girls went to the mountainside huts and took Wong with them,\u0026rdquo; she said kissing him while she struggled with the tie to his swim trunks. \u0026ldquo;We have the beach to ourselves \u0026hellip; except for the Russian plane, of course.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uh, my daughter?\u0026rdquo; he protested.\n\u0026ldquo;After you get to know the mers, you\u0026rsquo;ll understand that sex is a pretty regular thing around here,\u0026rdquo; she giggled as she pushed his shorts down to the sand. \u0026ldquo;Not bad for an old man,\u0026rdquo; she said, stroking his slowly hardening cock.\n\u0026ldquo;I hope that objects in a Russian camera lens are larger than they appear,\u0026rdquo; he joked as he pulled her into the water laughing.\nThe next day all the mers and their guests assembled in the Moon Pool, and it was beginning to get crowded. Shen and the girls were sitting along one side of the pool while Wong sat among them. All the mers were in the water, the children all swimming playfully among the gathered throng. Joy and Mac sat along a small ledge that extended out over the main tunnel entrance back to the sea. Joy was flipping through a small black notebook.\n\u0026ldquo;Military experience, what else?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;A medical doctor would be useful,\u0026rdquo; Pat offered. \u0026ldquo;The three of us are more scientists than doctors. An advanced specialty in genetics or neurology would be helpful to our research.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Check, no problem,\u0026rdquo; Joy said showing a name to Mac who nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;Where did you get all these names?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I work quickly,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, smiling at Sally. \u0026ldquo;Hopefully, Hank and Janice work nearly as quickly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are they doing?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Buying this island,\u0026rdquo; Sally answered.\n\u0026ldquo;How can they do that?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked. \u0026ldquo;This area has been declared a Blackgate Zone, and you did it.\u0026rdquo;\nSally shrugged.\n\u0026ldquo;Only to American intelligence officials,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, coming to her rescue. \u0026ldquo;The Republic of Kiribati doesn\u0026rsquo;t care, and it needs the money. Hank and Janice have combined their own considerable wealth with Sandi and Dawn\u0026rsquo;s fortune and are negotiating to buy the island.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How much would an Island like this cost?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked, playfully scowling at his daughter.\n\u0026ldquo;Depends,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Smaller islands have been sold for a few million dollars. This one should probably get five or six million. It\u0026rsquo;s too small for an airstrip, and it can\u0026rsquo;t support more than a few people on the land itself. The outlaying system of reefs could support hundreds maybe even thousands of mers. We can easily afford it; Hank and Janice are worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And Sandi and I were worth tens of millions of dollars,\u0026rdquo; Dawn offered. \u0026ldquo;We had all our funds liquidated and transferred over to Hank and Janice\u0026rsquo;s accounts.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then you will declare yourselves a new nation?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Something like that,\u0026rdquo; Joy answered. \u0026ldquo;And if you\u0026rsquo;re good, you can be the head of the military.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m resigning, remember?\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Daddy?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked lifting herself out of the water and plopping wetly next to him. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re what?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Resigning my commission, just like you did,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going to resign \u0026hellip; you?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked again. \u0026ldquo;How \u0026hellip; why?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is this a problem?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Um, no!\u0026rdquo; Sally said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just \u0026hellip; just \u0026hellip; surprised, that\u0026rsquo;s all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not just resigning,\u0026rdquo; he continued. \u0026ldquo;Joy and I will finish tying up a few loose ends, but we will return in a few weeks or months, depending on how successful we are, and start our own pod,\u0026rdquo; he said.\nSally literally tackled her father and smothered him in mermaid kisses.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Daddy!\u0026rdquo; she squealed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so happy! You will love being a mermaid!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Merman, if you please,\u0026rdquo; Mac corrected her, trying to get out from under her considerable weight. Damn, mermaid tails were heavy.\n\u0026ldquo;I mean merman,\u0026rdquo; she said smiling. \u0026ldquo;Joy will be your mermaid, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Sally-su-su,\u0026rdquo; Joy said tenderly. \u0026ldquo;I will be his mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We can be a family again,\u0026rdquo; Sally gushed.\n\u0026ldquo;We can be a family for the first time,\u0026rdquo; Mac corrected her. \u0026ldquo;I know that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t always the best fath\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not listening,\u0026rdquo; Sally said firmly. \u0026ldquo;You were the best father of all my friends, and you \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;I know these family issues are important, but can we return to our task?\u0026rdquo; Pat interrupted. \u0026ldquo;We have more transitions to plan in the meantime.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Shen and the girls shouldn\u0026rsquo;t wait much longer to start on their journey,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;Poor Esmée has been waiting forever to grow back her ear and get rid of her scar, and Wong is particularly anxious to heal his paralysis.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I ready to swim,\u0026rdquo; he said, smiling from his perch among the girls, his legs still uselessly dangling in the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry, yes of course. Why can\u0026rsquo;t some of them transition with Rose and Trevor?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;That would still leave one of us out, and we all agreed to wait until everything was settled,\u0026rdquo; Shen said in her British-Asian accent. \u0026ldquo;Even Esmée, poor thing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And we are waiting for my parents to return before we fill our pod,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s got a thing for my younger sisters,\u0026rdquo; Rose teased.\n\u0026ldquo;I do not,\u0026rdquo; he protested.\n\u0026ldquo;You do too,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;We can see it a mile away and Rose does too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Takes one to know one, I suppose,\u0026rdquo; Rose said.\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed, it does,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said, kissing Emma. MuSu just raised an eyebrow at Trevor.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s enough of that. We need at least one more male,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;I can have one here in twelve hours,\u0026rdquo; Joy announced.\n\u0026ldquo;And you trust him?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Pinky swear,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, holding her pinky out to Sally, who took it and gave it a shake.\nBoth Mac and Joy made several radio calls from the lab cave, and only Sally, Eric, Pat, and John were present. Even though all the mers had sworn to secrecy and sallekhana, everyone agreed that some plans called for fewer participants. If all went as planned, it would be a busy time on Mermaid Island for the next few weeks.\nWith the radio calls done, Galina, Alexis, and Emma entered the lab cave while Gabriel wrestled Manalo into the room. When Gabriel released Manalo from his grip, he started screaming.\n\u0026ldquo;Get your fucking hands off me, you fish!\u0026rdquo; he yelled as soon as his head broke the water. \u0026ldquo;If you stick me with that barb one more time, I\u0026rsquo;ll fucking kill you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said, nearly laughing.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you going to do with me?\u0026rdquo; he demanded, making for edge of the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll find out shortly,\u0026rdquo; John warned, salamandering over to the edge of the pool, keeping Manalo from getting out. \u0026ldquo;You just stay put, until we tell you otherwise.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or what?\u0026rdquo; he demanded, searching the floor of the cave with his eyes, looking for a weapon.\n\u0026ldquo;Or we will just paralyze you again,\u0026rdquo; he answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck you,\u0026rdquo; Manalo sputtered.\n\u0026ldquo;Why are they all the same?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked rhetorically. \u0026ldquo;Gabriel, if you please?\u0026rdquo;\nManalo didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to even turn around before Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s barb landed in his thigh.\n\u0026ldquo;Not aggggaaaa\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he mumbled as the poison did its work.\nJohn grabbed an arm and pulled the small man from the pool, laying him out on the cave floor. At that moment, Shen and Lin appeared in the pool, escorted by Rikki and Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; Lin said as her face broke the surface. \u0026ldquo;That was cool,\u0026rdquo; she gushed, unlinking her arm from Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s waist. \u0026ldquo;Thanks for the air.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Anytime,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Shen agreed. \u0026ldquo;Thanks, but I can\u0026rsquo;t wait until we can breathe on our own underwater.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Lin, it\u0026rsquo;s time,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;You need to decide.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Make him a dolphin,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Tutu\u0026rsquo;s mate?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, her sister,\u0026rdquo; Lin said. \u0026ldquo;He will never again take a female of any species.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Poor Tutu,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;She really does need a boyfriend.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She will get one,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Dolphins mate in pods too, you know, several females to a single male. With two of them, they actually stand a better chance of attracting a male\u0026rsquo;s attention.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or we can make them a mate eventually,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of mates, who\u0026rsquo;s got our kids?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Need you ask?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;I was just making sure,\u0026rdquo; Pat said testily. \u0026ldquo;It never hurts to ask.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When our children grow up, they will all think that Danni is their mother,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe sighed. \u0026ldquo;She really loves those kids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, only a hint of jealousy in her voice. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get done with Manalo so that we can get back to our daughters.\u0026rdquo;\nManalo watched helplessly as several mermaids lifted him up and placed him in a large Plexiglas tub, half filled with seawater, and he worried that he would drown. He felt large straps secure him to the side of the tub, the water covering everything but his face. He could see only one side of the tub, but several white disks that attached to wires blocked his view of the lab. The wires ran out from the tub along the lab floor where he could see the mermaids attaching another set of disks to their backs.\n\u0026ldquo;I think we will call her Mumu,\u0026rdquo; a tall blond mermaid said as she sank a needle into his other thigh, the one untouched by the merman\u0026rsquo;s barb.\nA burning sensation started in Manalo\u0026rsquo;s leg and traveled upwards towards his torso. He could hear a faint humming even though his ears were underwater, and he felt a slow tension build in his body. The water began to feel hot, then cold, then hot again, and he could feel waves of energy pulsing from the disks along the side of the tub. His body grew more and more rigid, and his blood pounded in his ears. Suddenly, a great wave of icy-hot pins and needles shot through his body, and his mind went blank.\nHe thought he blacked out, but then he felt the straps loosened on his body, and he knew that he was floating. He felt his chin push forwards more and more until it felt like his head was going to pop off his neck. He craned his face upwards, trying to ease the pain in his head, but his jaw shot forward, morphing and changing. His forehead felt like a balloon was expanding under his skin. His whole head felt like it was floating free of his neck, and then it reattached itself in a new place.\nHis skin felt tingly and sensitive, the waves of energy washing over him. He could feel his legs and arms disappearing, merging with his torso, as the siren cells forced new DNA coding on each of his cells, morphing and changing. He felt a great roiling in his abdomen, and then he sensed he was no longer a he. His last human thought was that his father would be so disappointed in him, becoming a girl.\nAfter nearly twenty minutes, the mermaids relaxed and stopped humming. The female dolphin lay placidly in the tank, waiting to be dumped into the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;It takes so much more mental focus to do that than to do a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe sighed, rubbing her neck.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s because there is no help from the subject,\u0026rdquo; Alexis surmised.\n\u0026ldquo;And lots of chromosomes to change,\u0026rdquo; Joy said.\n\u0026ldquo;That was amazing,\u0026rdquo; Mac said.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think the plans will work?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;There is only one way to find out,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;We try.\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/changes-in-paradise11/","tags":["mermaids","transgender","transformation"],"title":"Changes in Paradise: Part 11 - Babies, Beliefs, and By-Products"},{"categories":["Mermaids"],"contents":"Joy recruits an old friend to be a new mer, the Moon Pool itself changes, and the saga continues.\nMark Johnson was fifty-six years old and retired. He was enjoying his usual late afternoon coffee at the Quan Ngon, a small bistro style restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City when he got a short text message on his phone. It was a latitude and longitude followed by a single word: Tarzan. He hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen that code word in a very long time. He looked up at the bustling city around him. \u0026ldquo;Tarzan: was the deep cover order from his former boss at the CIA, Joy Simpson, but she retired several years ago. What was she doing?\nHe sipped his sweet coffee, suddenly over come by the memories of his last special ops tour in Viet Nam over thirty-five years ago. Joy was a recruiting agent for the CIA, and they couldn\u0026rsquo;t have picked a better one. She was beautiful, smart, sophisticated, ruthless, intensely loyal, and she needed him. In the bitter days that followed his last mission, Joy had probably saved his life. The black ops mission went terribly awry, wiping out the whole team. He tried to shake the memory from his mind; refusing to think about the grief and self-loathing he suffered in the wake of surviving that mission.\nHow he had survived, he still did not know. One minute they were rigging a listening device high up river in the Mekong, and then next thing he remembered, he was in a hospital. Jones, their team leader, had managed to get all of them back to their PRB (patrol river boat), and back down the river to the extraction point, but only Mark had survived the trip. His wounds probably saved him because he spent the return trip unconscious in the bottom of the boat. Snipers, according to the official report, picked off his teammates one by one, and the one that killed Jones got him seconds before the helicopter showed up. One of the Sea King\u0026rsquo;s UH-1 Iroquois rockets obliterated the sniper, but Mark was the only one the Navy fliers were able to save. Everyone else returned in a body bag.\nJoy approached him after his release from the hospital\u0026ndash;headed back to America with a piece of Chinese manufactured lead lodged near his spine. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t afraid of the slug buried in his body; he was terrified of facing the friends and families of the men who he had outlived. Joy begged him to help her, and he could not refuse a damsel in distress. His SEAL training had worked too well. He would help her if it cost him his life, and he hoped that it would.\nLater in life, Mark came to realize that second thought was the real reason why he joined Joy\u0026rsquo;s team, not the former. She was beautiful, needed help, and she was persuasive, but ultimately she offered him a way out of his nightmare and an honorable way to die in service to his country. He went from SEAL to secret agent with a grim smile on his face and a flag tattooed over his heart. He never regretted his decision, even though he had survived his time as an agent too, slug or no slug.\nMark spoke nine languages, could make almost anything into a weapon, fly, steer, or drive nearly any machine, and had never married. He didn\u0026rsquo;t know why he returned to Viet Nam when he retired, but it some how felt like home to him. He was still a good-looking man, but he could not bring himself to take a Vietnamese wife. He told himself that it was because he wanted Joy, but she had a thing for some guy in the Navy brass. Became an Admiral or something. What he couldn\u0026rsquo;t admit to himself was that no woman he had met fired his libido, his imagination, and his need to be \u0026ldquo;needed.\u0026rdquo; Sure, many women \u0026ldquo;wanted\u0026rdquo; to be rescued, but few \u0026ldquo;needed\u0026rdquo; him to do something for or with them.\nHe flipped open his phone and looked at the text message again: Tarzan 3:23:51s - 174:40:52w. Somewhere in the South Pacific, but it was no place that he recognized. Well, perhaps it was better late than never. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing much with his life, and as a former cold war warrior who found the new faces of terrorism horrifying and incomprehensible, a new mission with Joy would be exciting and sensible. This time, after he rescued his favorite damsel in distress, perhaps she would grace him with a kiss \u0026hellip; or something more.\nTarzan. Deep cover. No forwarding, no word, just disappear. Well, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the first time he did that for an old friend. He rose from the table, tossed a few extra dong next to his coffee, and walked out into the crowded street.\nWhere could he put his hands on a plane that he could afford and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t attract attention?\nEmma, Cleo, Rikki and MuSu lay on the beach, looking at the stars. MuSu had sensed something different in his girls after they met Joy and Mac, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out what changed. It had finally reached the point that he had to take action, and so he took them out for a moonlight swim. He would try to learn what was bothering them with indirect investigations.\nHe raised himself up and looked at his three mermaids. It struck him, once again, how beautiful they were, and how incredible it was to have triplets for pod-mates. Although each of them looked identical to the others, each was a very unique mermaid. Emma, the stubborn, inquisitive, scientist, lay closest to him, her blue and white tail glowing softly in the moonlight. Her face, like her sister\u0026rsquo;s, was touched with melancholy around her eyes, which even now glistened with tears. Cleo was toying with her hair, always conscious of how she looked, but not always conscious of who was looking. Rikki lay furthest away, her eyes looking back at him. The spitfire among her sisters, she was MuSu\u0026rsquo;s near opposite, but their shared sexual spark was particularly intense. He felt his cock twitch deep within his tail as she gazed at him.\nHe winked at her and lay back down, thinking and looking at the stars. He felt his cock stir again, but he willed it into submission. He had taken his girls to this secluded beach for a different purpose. As the throbbing faded, he took stock of himself as he puzzled as to why all three girls were so gloomy. As for himself, he found it hard to remember being a human or even being a girl. He had spent most of his life as a spoiled, pretty girl whose father worked in the banking industry in Hong Kong. Alberto had changed all that, and the mers had changed everything. None of those memories helped. Why would Mac and Joy set his girls off?\nHe sat back up and looked down at himself, flexing his large, strong hands, the yellow webbing in between each finger reaching to his first knuckle. His elbow fins, the same bright yellow, were relaxed, tucked against the back of his arms. He reached up to the sky in a stretch, feeling his neck and back pop, his broad shoulders rolling as he pushed each arm across his chest. He loved the feelings of power his new body gave him, and he was very happy to be both a man and a mer. He stretched out his tail, spreading his flukes apart, watching the yellow and black stripes shimmer in the moonlight. He felt the gaze of his girls on him, and turned to meet their gaze.\nThe four of them looked at one another in the moonlight, their skin and scales gleaming in the pale, yellow light. MuSu tried to \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; their mer-bonds in the way that Eric could, but he could not. However, he could feel the strong emotions that bound them together. He closed his eyes and \u0026ldquo;looked\u0026rdquo; at each of his pod-mates. Emma was pensive, but alert, watching him watch her. Cleo was just sad, and Rikki was seething with frustration at her own feelings of melancholy. A new insight suddenly struck him, and he opened his eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you want to go look for them?\u0026rdquo; MuSu asked, guessing at what was eating at his pod-mates. \u0026ldquo;Your parents, do you want to try and find them?\u0026rdquo;\nAll three girls sat up and looked at him with a mixture of surprise, sadness, and gratitude.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s it,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said with sad realization as her sisters nodded in agreement. \u0026ldquo;How did you know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought about you watching Mac and Sally,\u0026rdquo; he said tenderly. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what you were feeling, but I could feel your hearts aching. I just guessed. If you like, we can talk to the others about going on an expedition to look for your parents.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We should have asked Alberto before they killed him,\u0026rdquo; Rikki spat.\n\u0026ldquo;Or we could just ask Liga!\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;She might remember what happened!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why didn\u0026rsquo;t we ever think of that before?\u0026rdquo; Rikki asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Because we haven\u0026rsquo;t missed our parents since we changed,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said, her intuition guiding her. \u0026ldquo;You, MuSu, have been everything we could need, and it took seeing Sally and Mac together to make us remember.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, MuSu,\u0026rdquo; Emma said, rolling over on top of him and raining him with kisses. \u0026ldquo;You are the best mate ever. How did we ever get lucky enough to have you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; he said, returning Emma\u0026rsquo;s ardent kisses. \u0026ldquo;But why don\u0026rsquo;t you take a few minutes to show me before we go back to the caves?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It may take all three of us to show you,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said, pulling Cleo towards MuSu, surrounding their pod-mate with very relieved and now horny mermaids.\nMuSu tugged on his vent muscle and allowed his quickly rising cock to spring free. All three girls put a small delicate hand on his long, stiff member, and began sharing it like a Popsicle. He groaned and lay back down onto the sand. Yes, he was very glad to be their mate.\nFor the next several hours, sounds of squealing, laughing, moaning, and kissing rose from the beach. It was nearly daylight before the pod headed back for the caves.\nMalaki looked up from his desk at his assembled staff. Most of them were hiding their fear quite well; some were not.\n\u0026ldquo;Four weeks?\u0026rdquo; he asked calmly, but everyone could feel the deep anger just below the surface of his words.\n\u0026ldquo;His last message was that he was headed home,\u0026rdquo; one of Malaki\u0026rsquo;s lieutenants said, his brow beading with sweat.\n\u0026ldquo;After two weeks you did not come to me?\u0026rdquo; Malaki asked, rising to look out of the large window on the city below.\n\u0026ldquo;We found the boat,\u0026rdquo; the visibly shaking man said.\n\u0026ldquo;I found the boat,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said calmly, nodding to one of the large men near the main door to the office.\nThere was a sharp hiss and the man who had failed Malaki crumpled to the ground. No one in the room flinched. Everyone had seen it coming. One of the bodyguards holstered a needle gun, while two other men came in from the outer office, Sudhish leading them in to the room. They picked up the dead man, a small hole in his neck oozing a small drop of blood. Malaki\u0026rsquo;s personal secretary supervised the other two men as they collected the dead body and left the room, lingering near the door to hear what happened next.\n\u0026ldquo;Abao,\u0026rdquo; Malaki addressed his second son. \u0026ldquo;Find out what happened to your brother.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir,\u0026rdquo; the young man responded.\n\u0026ldquo;And my money,\u0026rdquo; he continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir,\u0026rdquo; Abao said with more confidence than he felt.\n\u0026ldquo;And don\u0026rsquo;t fuck it up,\u0026rdquo; Malaki finished, dismissing everyone.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir,\u0026rdquo; Abao said, the edge of fear creeping into his voice.\nHe watched as they filed from his office. Manalo had gone missing, the yacht he had been using turned up in Hong Kong. He and the girl had traded Malaki\u0026rsquo;s boat for the one that was bugged with a tracking device, and they had picked up a cripple. According to the report on his desk, Manalo and Shen Chin had taken a handicapped Chinese man with them in the new boat. There might have been others on board, but his agent in Hong Kong couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sure.\nDamn it. There was something else going on here. There was something other than Alberto\u0026rsquo;s disappearance along with a few million of his own dollars at work. What? He had three more sons that he could throw at the problem, but he wanted to keep a low profile. Many of his lieutenants were looking for any sign of weakness in his leadership, and Malaki had no doubt that even his vaunted bodyguards could not protect him against a concerted effort by his own people to replace him. He had to keep them all off balance and more than a little bit afraid. His own sons were perfect; the right mixture of loyalty and fear made them trustworthy, and their anger at their own father made them ruthless.\nMalaki remembered how his boys reacted when the found their own mother sleeping with one of Malaki\u0026rsquo;s business associates. Despite the oldest only being fourteen, Malaki did not need to raise a finger. His disloyal wife and her lover were both dead instantly. The Islamic Mayor of their small town, along with a few well-placed bribes, insured that his boys escaped any official punishment. The mayor didn\u0026rsquo;t have a very high opinion of women, and the boy\u0026rsquo;s actions were \u0026ldquo;completely justifiable.\u0026rdquo;\nManalo had been particularly ruthless, cutting off the offending body part of his wife\u0026rsquo;s lover. But that was part of Manalo\u0026rsquo;s problem, he was obsessed with sex, and Malaki wondered if Ms. Chin had influenced his son. Abao was much more of a detective than his eldest son, Manalo was, and far less likely to fall victim to a pretty face. Perhaps Abao\u0026rsquo;s more analytical nature would prove the difference in discovering what happened to Alberto, Tumibay, and now Manalo.\nThat was it! Ms. Chin was the key to discovering the fates of all three men.\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. Basra,\u0026rdquo; he barked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir?\u0026rdquo; Sudhish answered, entering the office.\n\u0026ldquo;Pull all files and contacts related to Ms. Chin and her sister,\u0026rdquo; he ordered. \u0026ldquo;I want a report by tomorrow morning that details both of their movements for the past six months.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir!\u0026rdquo; Sudhish answered, as he backed out of the office.\nWhat luck! Malaki was ordering him to do a task he had been trying to do secretly for several days. He would simply make sure to leave some information off, and, he would not mention in his report that he would also be looking for his own sister.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t a very good plane anyway, Mark thought to himself as he watched it plod forward in the sky without him. He had only a few seconds before he plunged into the water, cool and refreshing despite hitting the surface at nearly one hundred miles an hour. He had just dropped his pack into the water and tied a dead man\u0026rsquo;s knot around the rudder as the plane circled back over his still floating pack. In the few seconds he had for reflection, he admired the way the plane itself limped towards the water. Even with the flaps down, it was still moving at a pretty good clip.\nAll of this would have been unnecessary, Mark thought to himself as the water rushed up to greet him, if one of the plane\u0026rsquo;s floats had not fallen off shortly after take off. No wonder he could afford the plane; only hope and hairpins held it together. Still, it had served its purpose, getting him to this small, remote island in the middle of the South Pacific despite everything. He would have preferred to land in the lagoon softly rather than plummeting like a rock towards the open sea just past the reefs. This was going to hurt, he thought to himself.\nStill, all in all, the unexpected plunge into the ocean without a parachute didn\u0026rsquo;t really scare him, although it should have. Placing all his trust in that short text message did, however. He was past caring as he hit the water, and his world exploded with bright, glittery pain. Perhaps he would finally get his wish, and this day would be the one on which he would die in the service of others.\nA few agonizing moments later, he regained consciousness. It was not going to be his lucky day; he survived yet another brave but foolhardy attempt on his own life. But he was going to pay for this one, as every bone and muscle in his body throbbed with pain. After a few minutes of floating in the water, trying to recover, he could make out some figures on the beach. After a few minutes more, he could see that not all of them were human.\nHe thought about just sinking into the water\u0026rsquo;s warm embrace, but that seemed so cliché after going through everything that he had suffered. Besides, the strange creatures didn\u0026rsquo;t look threatening, just unbelievable. Although his body ached from his emergency exit, his eyes were still eagle sharp, even at his advanced age. He could see one of the human figures who was walking towards the water, waving; it was Joy Simpson, looking fabulous with her long white hair, deep tan, and one-piece bathing suit.\n\u0026ldquo;Mark,\u0026rdquo; she shouted, her voice carrying over the sounds of the ocean. \u0026ldquo;Want some help?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; he shouted back, unsurprised that Joy would know that he had one.\nHe watched as four figures dashed for the beach, sinuously snaking their way down the sand and into the water. In mere seconds, a beautiful young girl\u0026rsquo;s face popped up in front of him. He nearly drowned gaping in surprise, swallowing water.\n\u0026ldquo;I won,\u0026rdquo; she said, giggling.\nAnother identical face popped up beside her. \u0026ldquo;No you didn\u0026rsquo;t. MuSu did.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, he didn\u0026rsquo;t. I don\u0026rsquo;t see him anywhere,\u0026rdquo; the first mermaid said.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s because I already have the pack,\u0026rdquo; a handsome Asian merman said, popping up beside Mark. \u0026ldquo;Are you alright?\u0026rdquo; the merman asked. \u0026ldquo;That was quite a leap you took.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It was \u0026hellip; nothing,\u0026rdquo; Mark said, still trying to assimilate the vision he saw before him. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve done worse.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that was either the coolest or the most stupid thing I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen anyone do,\u0026rdquo; the merman said. \u0026ldquo;Is there anything else besides this pack?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, no,\u0026rdquo; Mark answered. \u0026ldquo;How did you swim out here so fast?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It was \u0026hellip; nothing,\u0026rdquo; the merman said with a mysterious smile.\n\u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re not hurt, let us push you!\u0026rdquo; one of the mermaids said to Mark.\n\u0026ldquo;Push me?\u0026rdquo; he sputtered, wondering why Joy had called him to this place.\n\u0026ldquo;We hold onto your legs, and push you,\u0026rdquo; she explained as a third identical mermaid joined them, bobbing in the water before him. \u0026ldquo;You just hold your hands out like Superman and body surf on your belly. You\u0026rsquo;ll be fine.\u0026rdquo;\nMark looked for some sense of sanity from the merman to his left. The handsome young man merely shrugged his shoulders and smiled sheepishly.\n\u0026ldquo;They like to play,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said. \u0026ldquo;My name is MuSu. You must be Mark Johnson. Joy has told us all about you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hi, yes. Well. That is,\u0026rdquo; Mark sputtered. \u0026ldquo;She hasn\u0026rsquo;t told me anything about you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m Emma, and this is Rikki, and the slowpoke is Cleo,\u0026rdquo; a mermaid said, as the one who arrived late stuck her tongue out.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about trying to tell the difference yet. How about that push, and then you can hear all about it from Joy herself?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked. \u0026ldquo;Or do you want to tred water for the next few hours?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, push away,\u0026rdquo; Mark answered.\nIt was the right answer, evidently, because MuSu gave him a big smile and ducked under the water and headed for the beach. Mark saw a dorsal fin rise from the merman\u0026rsquo;s back as he picked up speed. The three girls all swam beneath him, and he felt small, feminine hands grip his legs with surprising strength, and then begin to push him forward through the water. He remembered the Superman thing, and stretched his arms out, hydroplaning along the surface of the water, as if they towed him behind a speedboat. His old body, still shocked by his forced entry into the water at nearly one hundred miles per hour, started to protest, but by the time he reached the beach, he was laughing like a kid.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything special planned for the next several centuries anyway,\u0026rdquo; Mark said laughing again. By the time Joy, Mac, and the mers finished bringing him up to date, the stars were beginning to appear in the sky.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re serious? You can make up your mind that quickly?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Ask Joy,\u0026rdquo; Mark said with a wink.\n\u0026ldquo;He has the excellent quality of trusting his commander,\u0026rdquo; Joy said smiling back at her old friend. \u0026ldquo;And he trusts his instincts. You have to, if you want to stay a living agent rather than a dead one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are your real reasons?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\nMark gave Mac a long look, and then glanced over at the assembled mers and humans around him. He gave a deep sigh, and then spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;First, it is clear to me that I\u0026rsquo;m never going to get Joy away from you,\u0026rdquo; Mark said with a smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Affirmative,\u0026rdquo; Mac said without rancor.\n\u0026ldquo;Second, this is the first time that I’ve felt that I could become part of a real team since Nam,\u0026rdquo; Mark said with only a tinge of sadness. \u0026ldquo;No offense, Joy.\n\u0026ldquo;None taken. He used to be a SEAL,\u0026rdquo; Joy explained to the mers. \u0026ldquo;And his entire team was wiped out. You know that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t your fault.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Joy,\u0026rdquo; he started with a dark look in his eye.\n\u0026ldquo;You have to stop punishing yourself for surviving!\u0026rdquo; Joy argued.\n\u0026ldquo;So you say. And third, my back is still killing me, and I think mermaid milk might just be what the doctor ordered. So, what\u0026rsquo;s the plan?\u0026rdquo; Mark asked, trying to divert Joy\u0026rsquo;s comment, looking around at all the mermaids and humans that surrounded him.\n\u0026ldquo;Shen?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked after a moment of awkward silence. \u0026ldquo;Have you guys worked it out yet?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Shen answered looking at her sister and the shy, disfigured French girl. \u0026ldquo;We three will go with Wong, and Trixi, Homa, and Binah will go with Mark.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, that way Trixi will have a male who is stronger and bigger than she is right from the start,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, understanding.\n\u0026ldquo;Why does Trixi need me?\u0026rdquo; Mark asked. \u0026ldquo;Not that I\u0026rsquo;m complaining. She\u0026rsquo;s cute and I\u0026rsquo;m an old man.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you won\u0026rsquo;t stay old for long,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;And Trixi isn\u0026rsquo;t really a woman, at least not genetically. She still has her boy parts. Are you going to be able to handle that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Lady,\u0026rdquo; Mark said evenly. \u0026ldquo;A SEAL can handle anything, and my word is my bond. I\u0026rsquo;d be honored to be your pod-mate,\u0026rdquo; he said, turning to Trixi, Homa, and Binah.\n\u0026ldquo;What happened to your first team?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked. \u0026ldquo;I mean you don\u0026rsquo;t have to answer, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to.\u0026rdquo;\nJoy started to answer, but Mark held up his hand.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a fair question, but the answer is that I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; he said heavily. \u0026ldquo;I was wounded, unconscious, and the only survivor. I have always believed that I let my team down; that it was my fault. I know, Joy, I have read the official report myself. But that is not how things go in here,\u0026rdquo; he said tapping his chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said softly. \u0026ldquo;That must have been hard on you.\u0026rdquo;\nShe glanced over at Homa to see how she was handling everything. Homa was staring at Mark with an intensity Trixi had never seen before. Trixi nudged her.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Homa demanded.\n\u0026ldquo;You were staring,\u0026rdquo; she said in a whisper.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen a man be honest before,\u0026rdquo; she said loud enough for everyone to hear.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s too bad,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;This shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be your first time. I know lots of guys put up all kinds of bullshit, and do all kinds of crazy things to hide the truth of themselves from other people, and from themselves. But I learned long ago that if you couldn\u0026rsquo;t be honest with yourself, you couldn\u0026rsquo;t appear to be honest to the enemy or anyone else.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Honesty is sometimes the best foundation for a needful lie,\u0026rdquo; Joy agreed, watching Mark negotiate these damaged women with great skill and compassion.\n\u0026ldquo;Honesty is a lie?\u0026rdquo; Homa asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Only sometimes,\u0026rdquo; Joy said gently.\n\u0026ldquo;I never break a promise to a friend,\u0026rdquo; Mark said.\n\u0026ldquo;Will you make me a promise?\u0026rdquo; Homa asked, her eyes flashing with emotion.\nMark looked at the young Persian woman, so beautiful but so angry. His long experience as a secret agent gave him many insights into other people, and unfortunately, he knew the look she was giving him all too well. This woman had known abuse, horrible and terrible abuse. She showed more damage, in many ways, than the unfortunately disfigured French girl. Yes, Shen had explained all about Malaki, Manalo, and the brothels, but Mark could see something deeper, angrier, in her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Homa, I will make any promise you demand of me as long as you do not ask me to harm you, myself, or others,\u0026rdquo; he said.\nHoma blinked. She did not expect that answer. She turned to look at Trixi, and her lover looked back at her steadily, waiting to see what she had to say. She turned back to Mark, summoning up her courage.\n\u0026ldquo;I ask that,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Mark asked.\n\u0026ldquo;That you do not ever harm me, Trixi, or Binah,\u0026rdquo; she said, her eyes welling with tears as emotions swirled within her.\n\u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t need to promise that, and you didn\u0026rsquo;t want to ask me that,\u0026rdquo; he said gently. \u0026ldquo;What is the promise that you really want?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I want \u0026hellip; you to \u0026hellip; to \u0026hellip; promise \u0026hellip; to \u0026hellip; never \u0026hellip; touch me \u0026hellip; with out my permission or invitation,\u0026rdquo; she struggled to say.\n\u0026ldquo;I promise,\u0026rdquo; Mark said without hesitation. \u0026ldquo;I promise to never harm you or the other mers or to allow harm to come to you through my own inaction, and I promise never to touch you unless you ask me to,\u0026rdquo; Mark said, holding her gaze in his.\nA tense moment passed as Homa wavered between anger and hope, screaming or crying. No one moved.\n\u0026ldquo;Trixi, Binah,\u0026rdquo; he said softly. \u0026ldquo;I make the same promises to you too. What Homa asks I will give to all three of you.\u0026rdquo;\nHoma gasped and bit her hand. Tears fell silently from her eyes despite every effort she made to stop them. Had she so misjudged men? How could this one be so different? Why was he so different? He was an old man, nearly sixty, but he stood before them like a rock, unwavering. She watched him as he shifted his eyes to each of them, one at a time, holding their gaze without fear or deception. She could feel Binah, then Trixi each nod their heads to him, and then his gaze was on her.\nHis graying hair was short in a military style haircut, his face was clean shaven, his steel blue eyes were steady and calm, and he looked nothing like the dark figures of men who populated her nightmares, most especially her own father. Her earliest memories of him, of his dark, brooding face with bushy, dark eyebrows and his dark beard looming over her bed in the middle of the night \u0026hellip; touching her \u0026hellip; taking her \u0026hellip; while her siblings slept in the next room. Homa blinked again, clearing her head.\nShe nodded, her heart pounding with fear.\n\u0026ldquo;Good. Let\u0026rsquo;s get started,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Non-pregnant feeders only until we get the two pods situated into separate areas. Once Wong gets some weight on his bones, anyone can do the second or third feedings. We don\u0026rsquo;t want him to be dominated by his own girls. I think that Mark, however, will dominate his girl\u0026rsquo;s just fine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Only with their permission,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;A promise is a promise, and domination isn\u0026rsquo;t my style.\u0026rdquo;\nTrixi looked at Homa, checking to see that she was keeping herself under control. She was still biting her fist, but she had stopped crying. Trixi tried to think of something to ease the tension.\n\u0026ldquo;What is your style?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked with a twinkle in her eye.\n\u0026ldquo;Mutual satisfaction,\u0026rdquo; he said with a smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure you don\u0026rsquo;t remember anything more?\u0026rdquo; Cleo asked, her voice catching.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Cleo,\u0026rdquo; Liga sighed, stroking her hair in sympathy. \u0026ldquo;I wish I did, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t on that boat. Now, there is no one left who was.\u0026rdquo;\nThere was a moment of silence as the pods floated in the Moon Pool, waiting for MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod to say something. Pat had to admit that it was something of a stroke of genius for the girls to remember that Liga, formerly Lakan, might remember what had happened to their parents. But unfortunately, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t on their boat when it was pirated.\n\u0026ldquo;If I can be blunt?\u0026rdquo; Liga asked softly.\n\u0026ldquo;Please, go right ahead,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said, frowning.\n\u0026ldquo;Your father is definitely dead,\u0026rdquo; she said, soothing Mari as her child twitched in her arms. \u0026ldquo;Alberto would never have let a mature man live for very long. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t his style. Your mother might be, but she would have been sold into prostitution right away, and that means that she would be local, somewhere close like Davao, Suva, or even Tarawa.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you really think my mom might be alive?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, not really,\u0026rdquo; Liga said sadly. \u0026ldquo;It would take a miracle. Women your mother\u0026rsquo;s age usually went right to snuff fantasies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Snuff?\u0026rdquo; Cleo asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Snuffed out, like a candle,\u0026rdquo; Liga said. \u0026ldquo;By men who kill, wanting to dominate women to the point of death.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said, fighting back tears.\n\u0026ldquo;A miracle, huh?\u0026rdquo; Emma said, setting her jaw. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s fine with me. I\u0026rsquo;m already a miracle, and I think Mom deserves one too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Rikki agreed.\nCleo merely nodded, still shocked at learning what a snuff fantasy was.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s wait until we get everyone transitioned, and then we can talk about how you might develop a plan for looking for your mother,\u0026rdquo; Pat suggested. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve already hit the lottery on becoming mers; maybe there is more luck for you. Don\u0026rsquo;t cry, you\u0026rsquo;ll always have us as a family,\u0026rdquo; she said, putting her arm around Emma as the young mermaid began to cry.\n\u0026ldquo;We will look,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said firmly, his girls all lifting their heads to look at him. \u0026ldquo;We will look soon, and we will find her.\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish\u0026rsquo;s fingers shook with both fear and anger as he read the file he held. They had taken Geeta, his older sister, to Hong Kong to be \u0026ldquo;trained,\u0026rdquo; and were to kidnap Rani and Vidya, his two younger sisters, in four weeks, as soon as they finished school. He took a deep breath, calming his body, and used his old trick of photographic memorization to scan the entire file, the names, places, dates, and methods Malaki planned on using to keep him in line as his personal executive assistant. Within a few moments, he had scanned all the materials for his own family, and he moved on to Ms. Chin\u0026rsquo;s family.\nSudhish kept his breathing even, using the meditative techniques he had learned as a young boy, to help him control his anger and shock. The more he learned about Shen Chin, the more he recognized similar qualities and events in his own life. They both had gone to Oxford for college. They both had several siblings in a rare family that valued the women of the family nearly as much as the men. Both he and Shen spoke several languages, and both of them had studied a mixture of politics and literature while students. Finally, both he and Shen had Professor Yuen Foong Hong while at Oxford, despite the fact that both he and Shen had different majors.\nSudhish tried to think of a reason why Dr. Hong would be the only professor they had in common. He remembered that Hong was from Harvard, and researched contemporary Chinese history. Shen had studied business and Sudhish had studied literature. Dr. Hong wasn\u0026rsquo;t a language specialist, which might have explained why both Shen and he would have taken him, and there didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be any other files on Hong that helped explain the connection.\nSudhish assembled the files on the Chin sisters, and began to write his report. Manalo had ordered Lin\u0026rsquo;s transfer five weeks ago to Davao, one of their most notorious brothels, and one from which the young women and boys were not likely to emerge. The rescue plan, therefore, had to be a recent one. There was no information on the young man who they had picked up in Hong Kong, no name, no identification, but then the Chinese barely acknowledged that such people with physical disabilities actually existed.\nThe boat they had traded was more of a pleasure yacht than the luxury \u0026ldquo;workhorse\u0026rdquo; they had left with Thomson Marine, and they likely lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the trade, so Chin and Manalo had money to burn, Sudhish thought, probably Malaki\u0026rsquo;s money. They weren\u0026rsquo;t coming back, that much was clear to him. What interested him more was how Shen Chin had managed to turn Manalo to an ally. Sudhish had seen the staff picture of the pretty girl, and he doubted that a similar tactic might work for him. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to seduce anyone.\nHe finished up his report, leaving no facts off of his analysis of Ms. Chin\u0026rsquo;s likely whereabouts, and history, but he left out all the facts of processes, procedures, and loopholes that he himself hoped to exploit to rescue his own sister, and to prevent further harm coming to his younger sisters. Also, he left off the report the fact that he knew where his own sister was working.\nEsmée pulled back from Emma’s breast, feeling the power of mermaid milk course through her body. She felt her newly lengthened hair caress her back, and she knew that her face was finally whole. She raised her fingers to her lips, and felt for the first time in many years, a rich smoothness that had been missing. Her face, lips, and ear had healed!\nShe smiled a billion watt smile at Wong, who was finishing with Rikki. Wong could now move his legs but walking was still beyond his capabilities. Everyone was impressed with how well he handled the pain of his spine healing. He never gave so much as a whimper, even as sweat popped from his brow and his body twitched in agony. If his girls had any doubts about his suitability as their pod-mate, he had dispelled them. He was still growing in stature, and his body was filling out in all directions, especially the one she now required.\n\u0026ldquo;Wong,\u0026rdquo; she asked. \u0026ldquo;À quoi est-ce que je ressemble maintenant?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You look like a vision from heaven,\u0026rdquo; he answered. \u0026ldquo;You are very beautiful, and I never could have dreamed that such a beautiful woman would be with someone like me.\u0026rdquo;\nEsmée smiled, and slinked her perfect body over to the slim Chinese youth. His body was taut and smooth, nicely muscled, but thin. He looked like a high school swimmer, if he added a few more pounds. She turned and looked at her soon-to-be-pod-mates, Shen and Lin. Each of them was the picture of health, and they were each finishing with Timi and Ragi. She turned to Wong and kissed him soundly.\n\u0026ldquo;Who will be back to feed us in a few hours?\u0026rdquo; she asked the two sisters as they salamandered over to the small pool in the transition cave.\n\u0026ldquo;I think it will be Dawn, Sandi, Sally, and Galina,\u0026rdquo; Rikki answered. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re going slowly with you guys to insure Wong doesn\u0026rsquo;t run into any problems. No moms allowed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can almost walk now,\u0026rdquo; he said proudly. \u0026ldquo;I am fine. We will be ready for anyone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Until you can actually walk, we are going slowly,\u0026rdquo; Emma repeated. \u0026ldquo;You have lots of food to eat, and your girls are all concentrating on getting you strong and big, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; the three girls chorused.\n\u0026ldquo;How is Trixi doing?\u0026rdquo; Shen asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Fine, we think,\u0026rdquo; Rikki answered. \u0026ldquo;They have been using moms on the beach because Mark was never in any danger of being over powered by those women. Do you know he could bench press over 100 kg (220 lb) even though he was almost sixty?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;MuSu can do twice that,\u0026rdquo; Emma said.\n\u0026ldquo;But \u0026hellip; er \u0026hellip; I didn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026hellip; oh, Emma,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said exasperated. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean anything by that comment.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Emma said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;But it was fun to tease you. God, sometimes you\u0026rsquo;re worse than Cleo.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a low blow,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said, as she playfully smacked her sisterwife with her tail.\n\u0026ldquo;Stop,\u0026rdquo; Emma protested. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re distracting Wong.\u0026rdquo;\nWong merely smiled as Esmée settled herself onto his lap.\n\u0026ldquo;Wong, open up,\u0026rdquo; Esmée ordered. \u0026ldquo;You have got some growing to do. Now eat.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought I was supposed to be dominating you guys,\u0026rdquo; he said plaintively.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;ll learn,\u0026rdquo; Emma said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;They all do eventually.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What will I learn?\u0026rdquo; Wong demanded as Esmée forced some fish into his mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;That we are allowing you to stay a man,\u0026rdquo; Esmée said sweetly. \u0026ldquo;Est-ce que je les filles suis droites?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are right,\u0026rdquo; Shen and Lin answered. \u0026ldquo;Girls are in charge.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now, just because you are eating, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you can\u0026rsquo;t do something else,\u0026rdquo; Esmée said as she straddled the young man\u0026rsquo;s hips, gently forcing another bite into his mouth. \u0026ldquo;Shen, if you please?\u0026rdquo;\nShen reached over and guided Wong\u0026rsquo;s stiffening cock up to Esmée\u0026rsquo;s crotch, holding it steady as she lowered herself onto him.\n\u0026ldquo;Ummmmm,\u0026rdquo; she moaned as she sank down onto him. \u0026ldquo;Would you like some more?\u0026rdquo; she asked, holding the fish in her hand.\nWong nodded as Esmée began to move her hips.\nTrixi approached Pat\u0026rsquo;s breast with something close to reverence. Her breast was perfect, the nipple was stiff and protruding out from her areola, a few drops of mermaid\u0026rsquo;s milk oozing from the tip. Trixi sat down next to Pat, who still had her arms out, waiting for her to settle into her lap.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not going to bite you,\u0026rdquo; she teased.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just that \u0026hellip; this \u0026hellip; you \u0026hellip; you’re so beautiful. You\u0026rsquo;re everything I ever wanted to be.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have believed anyone who would have tried to tell me differently a few years ago, but being a mermaid is a wonderful thing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I was just talking about being a woman,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;A real woman who could have a baby.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to be anything other than a tweener if you don\u0026rsquo;t settle down and take a drink,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Look, everyone else is feeding.\u0026rdquo;\nTrixi gazed around her at the mers and people spread out on the beach. Mark\u0026rsquo;s soon-to-be-pod had returned to the beach to start their transition. Wong\u0026rsquo;s pod would transition to mers before they did so that Trixi, as per Rose\u0026rsquo;s and Emma\u0026rsquo;s advice, could enjoy some time as a human female before the change into a mermaid.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not because being a human girl is so special,\u0026rdquo; Rose had warned. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s because you won\u0026rsquo;t appreciate the difference when you become a mer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Emma had agreed. \u0026ldquo;I thought I was missing out on something because I went from boy to mermaid pretty quickly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mer-life and mer-sex is better,\u0026rdquo; Rose had told her. \u0026ldquo;But it is good to know for sure for yourself.\u0026rdquo;\nTrixi smiled at the memory, and adjusted her crotch. Her small penis was beginning to stiffen at the thought of the journey that lay before her.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on,\u0026rdquo; Pat urged. \u0026ldquo;I have to get back to Maureen.\u0026rdquo;\nTrixi felt a wave of emotion wash over her, and she quickly lowered her head to Pat\u0026rsquo;s lap, and allowed Pat to guide her towards her breast. The nipple felt like a small thumb in her mouth, a warm and nubby thumb with sweet milk that gushed into her mouth. Trixi swallowed reflexively, the unexpected spurt filling her mouth. She leaned into Pat\u0026rsquo;s breast and sucked harder, hearing Pat gasp above her. The milk was so \u0026hellip; good \u0026hellip; so \u0026hellip; warm \u0026hellip; so \u0026hellip; powerful.\nTrixi could feel the milk coursing through her body almost immediately, and she felt a pain in her own chest. The pain of healing, she remembered, as she sucked harder on the gushing breast that fed her. She could feel her chest slowly deflating as the siren cells attacked the implants inserted many years ago, and her \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; male musculature was \u0026ldquo;healed.\u0026rdquo; After a few minutes, the pain lessened, and Trixi\u0026rsquo;s abdomen felt full. The saline solution was now in her body, and she didn\u0026rsquo;t know what was being done to the plastic bags that had once held them in place.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s enough there, young lady,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;I have to save the other side for Maureen. You\u0026rsquo;ve had quite enough for your first official feeding. Now scoot back over to Mark, and get started towards womanhood again.\u0026rdquo;\nTrixi smiled up at Pat, savoring the sweet taste of mermaid\u0026rsquo;s milk. She sat up and looked over at Mark, who had already finished with Petra. She felt a twinge of jealousy; she wanted to look like that! Mark, however, was paying no attention to Petra as she salamandered back into the water. He was staring at her. Trixi felt a shiver go through her body, partly aggressive, partly sexual, and partly surrender. She understood that this was the moment; that now was the window of opportunity. She could challenge Mark, try to wrestle him down and become a man again.\nOr not. Who was she kidding? She did not want to be a man, and so she ruthlessly repressed the aggressive feelings that rose in her body. She was going to be a woman! She clasped her hands behind her back, thrusting her now flat chest towards Mark. She knew that she was not a very pretty woman now, but she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be for long!\n\u0026ldquo;Please, help me?\u0026rdquo; she asked, looking down at the sand.\nMark rose from where he had been sitting, and checked to see that Homa and Binah were still feeding with Phoebe and Xing. He would have Trixi to himself for a few minutes at least. He walked over to the tall, thin transsexual and brushed the medium length blond hair from her face. They were nearly the same height, and Mark could sense the battle within his/her body.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you want me to help you with?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I want to be like her,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, nodding at Petra\u0026rsquo;s retreating form.\n\u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; he asked. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think she is especially pretty.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Trixi stammered. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t think Petra is beautiful \u0026hellip; with those incredible breasts and her thin waist?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you think Homa is beautiful?\u0026rdquo; he asked softly. \u0026ldquo;Or Pat, or Xing, or Binah, or Esmée, or even Timi as well?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;O.K., I get the point,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;Just help me become something you think is attractive.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Finding someone attractive is more than just hormones and hair, breasts and butts,\u0026rdquo; Mark said.\n\u0026ldquo;But I want to be beautiful, to be \u0026hellip; a woman,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, not sure where Mark was headed.\n\u0026ldquo;What is it that you truly desire?\u0026rdquo; Mark asked, searching her eyes. \u0026ldquo;Is it merely beauty?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I want \u0026hellip; I want \u0026hellip; to \u0026hellip; be loved,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said with difficulty. \u0026ldquo;To be loved as a woman. I want to be worthy of someone’s love. Your love.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are worthy of love,\u0026rdquo; Mark said, feeling the healing milk course through his own body, filling him with energy he hadn\u0026rsquo;t felt in years. \u0026ldquo;And you are beautiful. Moreover, it has nothing to do with your looks or your gender. May I kiss you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, god \u0026hellip; yes,\u0026rdquo; Trixi swooned.\nMark took the thin \u0026ldquo;girl\u0026rdquo; into his arms and kissed her, feeling the slightest trace of stubble against his own. He knew that both of them would lose their facial hair in the change to mers, but feeling even that little bit on Trixi was strange to him. He knew that he could not react, and so he simply kissed her harder and turned her into a dip.\nTrixi inwardly groaned when she realized that both of their faces were stubbly, but she nearly fainted with pleasure when he dipped her down, and thrust his tongue into her mouth. She could feel her body \u0026ldquo;turn\u0026rdquo; just as Sandi, Rose, Emma, and the others had said she would. She melted into the kiss, willing her body to change, clutching at his strong shoulders as he held her above the sand. When he lifted them up, both of their eyes were shinning.\n\u0026ldquo;What planet did you come from?\u0026rdquo; she asked softly.\n\u0026ldquo;It’s a long story,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;But through fire and ice, true steel is tempered. Some people have to live through hell to know when heaven beckons.\u0026rdquo;\nHe took her in his arms again, and kissed her. He pressed his body against hers, feeling his old joints loosen and his aches and pains fall from his consciousness. He felt her sink into his arms, and her lips widen around his as she slipped inexorably towards womanhood. When he released her, her flat chest was heaving with passion.\n\u0026ldquo;Homa,\u0026rdquo; Trixi squealed as her soon-to-be-pod-mate rose from the sand to join them. \u0026ldquo;He did it! I\u0026rsquo;ve turned. I’m going to be a real woman. Kiss me again!\u0026rdquo; she said as she threw herself into his arms.\nMark complied, and as they kissed a memory from Viet Nam bubbled up. Dian Parkinson, a former Miss America who came with Bob Hope on his Christmas Tour in 1972. She was pretty, sweet, blond, and that\u0026rsquo;s who Trixi reminded him of, despite the latter\u0026rsquo;s tall coltish looks and angular face. Remembering all the coaching from John and Trevor, he focused his mind on that memory. That lovely lady, who became a hostess on \u0026ldquo;The Price is Right,\u0026rdquo; and later even did a Playboy special edition. He focused his mind on that memory, on her classic hourglass figure—37-23-37—and her beautiful and sexy face.\nTrixi felt a change in Mark\u0026rsquo;s kisses, and she realized that he was focusing his concentration on her. She broke off the kiss and fell to her knees, feeling the siren cells building energy in her body, shaping her, changing her. She looked at Mark\u0026rsquo;s crotch, and slid her fingers along his waistband, noting that her hand was changing. As she watched with fascination, her index finger grew longer and her ring finger shrank even as her entire hand got smaller. Her hands were changing into a woman\u0026rsquo;s hand!\nShe pulled at the snap of his shorts with her now delicate, but still aching fingers, and pulled them down to the ground. Mark\u0026rsquo;s cock popped free, only slightly hard, dropping towards her face. She felt Homa staring at them, and she could see Binah come up on the other side of Mark, her dark legs shining in the bright sunlight.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Trixi hissed, looking up into Mark\u0026rsquo;s face, feeling the changes he was focusing on her body. Her hips throbbed, her shoulders ached, and her face hurt, but it was all good pain, wonderful pain. She wanted more.\nShe reached forward and took his cock into her hand, and noticed the gray hairs scattered around his cock and balls. She giggled, remembering that most of her former clients who were Asian did not gray the way Occidentals did. Even as she watched, Trixi could see that Mark\u0026rsquo;s genitals were growing, and that his skin was tightening, looking younger and healthier. She gave his cock a lick, and felt a corresponding wave of change sweep through her body.\nThe connection \u0026hellip; if they were connected, it would make the bioelectric influences on her siren cells even stronger. She lifted his still stiffening cock to her mouth and sucked it in. She buried her nose in his pubic hair, and smelled his musky smell. She felt his cock lurch in her mouth, growing in her mouth, stiffening. When it was fully erect, it was now about seven inches long. She pulled it into her mouth again, and she felt her hips begin to spread outwards. Ah, the pain! The welcome, wonderful pain! She sucked even harder, and Mark rewarded her with a groan, as he unexpectedly erupted into her mouth. She swallowed as much as she could but some dribbled on her lips and chin.\nMark steadied his legs, which nearly buckled, breathing heavily.\n\u0026ldquo;That was amazing,\u0026rdquo; he said, reaching down to stroke Trixi\u0026rsquo;s face. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never felt anything like that before in my life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad you liked it,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;I can feel it working,\u0026rdquo; she groaned as she ran her hands over her body.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you alright?\u0026rdquo; Mark asked. \u0026ldquo;You sound like you\u0026rsquo;re in pain.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt much,\u0026rdquo; she lied. \u0026ldquo;Keep concentrating! Make me the woman I\u0026rsquo;ve always dreamed I could be.\u0026rdquo;\nMark looked at both Binah and Homa and silently urged them to participate. Trixi moaned with more pleasure and less pain as Mark and Binah reached out and put their hands on her body. She could feel their mental energies as a gentle pressure on her body and mind, shaping and morphing her body. She ran her own hands over theirs, stroking her own skin as her body changed. Although she had been taking hormones for several years, the radical change to her skin by the siren cells was dramatic. She reveled in the new softness that she felt under her fingertips.\n\u0026ldquo;Homa,\u0026rdquo; she urged. \u0026ldquo;Come feel my skin. I\u0026rsquo;m turning into a woman, a soft, beautiful woman!\u0026rdquo;\nHoma stood gaping at the sight before her. Her lover Trixi was on her knees before a man. Yes, he was a special man, perhaps, but he was still a man. Binah, her roommate of the last month, was standing next to him, stroking Trixi\u0026rsquo;s back. Although Mark was certainly more muscular than Binah, she still towered over all of them at nearly six feet tall. Yet she was pressing herself into him, pushing her breasts and body into his side. Homa felt fear, disgust, and desire all mixing and crashing together within her heart.\n\u0026ldquo;I \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; she said, close to sobbing.\nTrixi sensed the great turmoil within Homa, and she rose to her feet and walked over to her lover. With Mark\u0026rsquo;s semen still coating her lips and chin, Trixi kissed her, hoping that the effect of Mark\u0026rsquo;s semen would not be catastrophic to Homa.\nHoma sensed something on Trixi\u0026rsquo;s lips, but she pressed into the kiss, thrusting her tongue into Trixi\u0026rsquo;s mouth. She knew what Trixi had done, but she also knew that she couldn\u0026rsquo;t fight her demons alone. She needed Trixi. The lingering taste of Mark\u0026rsquo;s cum was not nearly as horrific as she thought it would be, and Trixi\u0026rsquo;s skin was softer, her lips were fuller, and Homa could even sense that Trixi was shrinking. Trixi groaned from a mixture of the pleasure from the kiss and the pain that coursed through her skeleton as the siren cell attacked her bones.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you doing to her?\u0026rdquo; Homa demanded, turning to Mark.\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing I haven\u0026rsquo;t asked him to do,\u0026rdquo; Trixi answered. \u0026ldquo;Pat said it would hurt, and it does.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why is she shrinking?\u0026rdquo; Homa asked, holding Trixi\u0026rsquo;s hands in her own. \u0026ldquo;Why not keep her the same height?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Trixi hissed. \u0026ldquo;I want to be just like you \u0026hellip; only blond.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We should get into the water,\u0026rdquo; Binah suggested. \u0026ldquo;Emma told me that it would help you.\u0026rdquo;\nTrixi looked at Mark and he immediately understood her silent request. He slipped beside her and lifted her into his arms. Trixi refused to let go of Homa\u0026rsquo;s hand, and together the four of them wadded out into the water. Once they were up to Homa\u0026rsquo;s waist, Mark let Trixi float on her back. Homa cradled her head, and Binah helped support her legs.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; it hurts so good,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said as she grimaced in pain.\nFor the next few minutes they watched as Trixi\u0026rsquo;s body slowly changed from a five foot ten inch tall, flat-chested transsexual into a five foot five inch tall womanly shaped transsexual. Her hair slowly lengthened and her face softened into the classically shaped features of a young girl. She refused to let go of Homa\u0026rsquo;s hand, and after a while, Homa stopped trying to leave. If Eric had been there, he could have told the four of them that the first tendrils of mer-connectivity had formed, tiny strands of light swirling among and between the four of them.\nHoma watched Trixi\u0026rsquo;s body change with rapt attention. She was slowly turning into a true beauty, and Homa\u0026rsquo;s attraction to Trixi was increasing with each change. Her eyes became wide set, and her mouth became fuller and more feminine. Her blue eyes sparkled with a new intensity, and her blond hair grew thick and long. Homa\u0026rsquo;s own hair was also growing, and it now hung below her breasts. Other than her longer hair and general physical health, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t changing very much, but she could feel herself changing mentally. After two hours of soaking in the water with Mark, Trixi, and Binah, Homa changed more than she realized.\nTrixi stopped moaning after the first twenty minutes, and after another hour, she felt well enough to return to the beach. Petra, Xing, Liga, and Alexis showed up shortly thereafter for their next feeding. Trixi walked purposefully towards Petra, determined to take from her generous breasts the complete womanhood she so desperately wanted.\nWong Shang Han flexed his legs, jumping up and down on the sandy floor of the Change Cave. He was now almost six feet tall and moderately muscled. Shen and Lin were now classic Chinese beauties, each about five feet six inches tall, and Esmée was a smoldering French beauty also five feet six inches tall. Wong wondered what he looked like, and thought to suggest that the mers find a mirror for this cave. He need not have worried, however, as he noticed the predatory looks his three girls were giving him.\n\u0026ldquo;Who knew he would turn out so well?\u0026rdquo; Esmée growled, feeling her completely healed body glow with sexual desire.\n\u0026ldquo;I did,\u0026rdquo; Shen said. \u0026ldquo;But he\u0026rsquo;s even better looking than his brother.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How come we haven\u0026rsquo;t changed?\u0026rdquo; Lin asked, running her hands along her willowy body. All three girls had remained more or less unchanged. Their slender bodies and modest curves had not been \u0026ldquo;improved\u0026rdquo; in any way. The only difference was that their dark hair was now down to their hips.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s because you three are perfect in every way,\u0026rdquo; Wong said, stroking Lin\u0026rsquo;s long, thick, shiny black hair.\n\u0026ldquo;I think you are perfect too,\u0026rdquo; Esmée said, pushing her own B cup breasts into Lin\u0026rsquo;s breasts. \u0026ldquo;Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts are just too big. Who would want to lug those around?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why were most of our fellow prostitutes forced to have implants?\u0026rdquo; Lin asked, grinding her slender but shapely hips into Esmée\u0026rsquo;s hips.\n\u0026ldquo;Because most men are stupid,\u0026rdquo; Shen answered, \u0026ldquo;and Manalo wanted to make as much money as possible off your bodies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why not ours, then?\u0026rdquo; Lin asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Because we were used for pleasure seekers of a different sort,\u0026rdquo; Esmée said, shuddering at the memory. \u0026ldquo;But that is all behind us now, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Wong said.\n\u0026ldquo;At least there is one of us that is greatly changed,\u0026rdquo; Shen said, reaching out to Wong\u0026rsquo;s now impressive cock, nearly seven inches long and hardening in her grasp.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Esmée said, kissing Lin. \u0026ldquo;How about we put that to good use before we make the transition to mers?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Won\u0026rsquo;t we want to have sex again after we change?\u0026rdquo; Lin asked, her breathing increasing as their bodies slid against one another\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;Quel est le problème avec faire l\u0026rsquo;amour deux fois?\u0026rdquo; Esmée giggled.\n\u0026ldquo;She asked if you had a problem with making love twice,\u0026rdquo; Shen translated.\n\u0026ldquo;I understood her,\u0026rdquo; Lin protested.\n\u0026ldquo;Tuo was right,\u0026rdquo; Shen said, awed.\n\u0026ldquo;Right how?\u0026rdquo; Esmée asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The mer bonds are already forming,\u0026rdquo; Shen said with some reverence. \u0026ldquo;Lin already understands you, and she\u0026rsquo;s never had a day of French in her life.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen Trixi finished with Petra, she could feel the siren cells reorganizing her internal organs into her new gender. It felt strange, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt the way her skeletal changes had. She felt a little queasy, but she was not going to let that get in the way of progress.\nFor the first half an hour, she lay next to Mark, touching him as Binah took her turn with him, riding him to a thundering orgasm. She cleaned up both of them, and then shared her kisses with Homa, who was slowly becoming more at ease with Mark, but she could not bring herself to touch him directly.\nThen Trixi felt an opening slowly emerge in her crotch, and she knew that her vagina had begun its final stages of development. She wanted to be finished! She pulled Mark into a standing position and knelt to take his quickly recovering cock into her mouth. Binah took Homa off to one side and lavished kisses and caresses on her while Trixi was busy with Mark.\nTrixi had sucked on many cocks in the past few years, but Mark\u0026rsquo;s was the first one that she actually wanted to suck. It tasted and felt delicious to her. It had grown to well over seven inches, which caused her both alarm and excitement. Alarm because her own vagina was so new, and excitement because it was beautiful. She quickly and expertly brought him to orgasm, and great streams of semen flooded down her throat, each pulse adding to the siren cells that were already at work in her body.\nAs Trixi swallowed the last pulse from Mark\u0026rsquo;s cock, she felt Mark\u0026rsquo;s renewed focus on her body, responding to his concentration, rushing to finish its transition into womanhood. She swooned with pleasure as her nipples grew and a new pressure expanded behind her enlarging nipples. She kept Mark\u0026rsquo;s cock in her mouth, willing him to stay hard as she arched her back, trying to force her breasts to grow. She felt her long hair caress her very slender waist, and rocked her wide hips back and forth over her feet as she knelt with her feet under her shapely ass. With each passing second, she could feel her breasts push outwards, slowly, sensuously growing. Finally, as she continued rocking, she felt their weight move independently of her ribs. A thrill ran through her body; she had real breasts!\nShe closed her eyes, Mark\u0026rsquo;s stiff cock in her mouth, lifting one hand to each heavy breast. She pulled on them, pushing them together, her nipples tingling as they stiffened into the air several inches from her ribs. Her skin felt soft, and her breasts were both firm and soft at the same time. The feel of her fingers rubbing along the undersides of her breasts sent delightful shivers of pleasure across her torso.\nHer new womb began to throb, a feeling of emptiness intensifying within her abdomen. She could feel the new lips of her vulva swell, and a feeling of wetness that she had never experienced before, oozed from deep within her body. Finally, she could sense that the siren cells were nearly finished, her last sensations were of a light tingling along her back, signifying that her proto-gills had appeared. The next day, they would all become mers.\nShe let Mark\u0026rsquo;s cock slip from her mouth, and she gazed down at her vastly changed body. She dropped her hands to her sides and watched her breasts swing heavily from her slender rib cage, arching away from her flat tummy. She rocked her shoulders to help them sway, her nipples stiff in the early evening breeze. She grabbed them again, lifting them up, watching the deep cleavage form between them.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah \u0026hellip; thank you,\u0026rdquo; she said as she sat back on her heels, looking up at Mark as she cradled her very large breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;The pleasure, Trixi, is entirely mine,\u0026rdquo; he said, his cock still twitching from her aggressive oral techniques. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe it\u0026rsquo;s still hard.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve had our three feedings, and tonight we will put that wonderful tool to good use,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;We might not let it ever go down.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We?\u0026rdquo; Mark asked. \u0026ldquo;Homa too?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Give her time,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s almost there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Someone has been incredibly cruel to her,\u0026rdquo; Mark observed, watching as Homa finished feeding from Alexis.\n\u0026ldquo;You are a very perceptive man,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;Her own father raped her when she was eight.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought Muslims \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Mark began.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t ever say that word in earshot of Homa,\u0026rdquo; Trixi warned. \u0026ldquo;Incest happens in all cultures and all religions. And there is a statistical relationship between how repressive a culture or religion is, and the incidence of incest.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I suppose you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Mark said, thinking. \u0026ldquo;I just assumed that \u0026hellip; yea, never mind. I have no idea what I was thinking. Do you think mers are capable of incest?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think so,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t truthfully answer that until I am a mermaid myself. But it seems unlikely given both mer-bonding and mer-senses. Anyone within a hundred yards of another mermaid pretty much knows what\u0026rsquo;s going on. It would be hard to attack someone without other mers knowing immediately.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do you know all this?\u0026rdquo; he asked. \u0026ldquo;Not about the mers, but about the incest?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;First, Homa told me everything, and second, there were several reasons why I wanted to become a woman,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said softly. \u0026ldquo;One was my uncle who \u0026hellip; who \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\nThey both paused as two dolphins surfaced in the lagoon, clicking and squealing. Mark and Trixi watched in silence as they circled twice, and seeing that none of their \u0026ldquo;creators\u0026rdquo; were present, headed back out past the reef. Marked looked back at Binah and Homa who were locked in an embrace. Mark turned back to Trixi.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have to tell me, if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to,\u0026rdquo; Mark said gently.\n\u0026ldquo;Now, that sounds familiar,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;No, you answered my question, I\u0026rsquo;ll answer yours. He forced me to give him oral sex when I was ten.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;re so \u0026hellip; so enthusiastic now,\u0026rdquo; Mark said.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve forgiven him, and myself,\u0026rdquo; she answered. \u0026ldquo;Besides, I really like you,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said shyly. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve never forced anyone to have sex, have you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Not my style.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ummm, right, mutual satisfaction,\u0026rdquo; Trixi purred. \u0026ldquo;How about you get to work on that?\u0026rdquo; she asked as she lay back onto the sand.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure you want me to touch you?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I want you to fuck me,\u0026rdquo; she said, arching her new breasts into the air and spreading her legs wide.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you ready?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\nTrixi dipped her hand down to her crotch, and felt the heat and wetness flow from her body.\n\u0026ldquo;I am so ready,\u0026rdquo; she breathed as she put two fingers into her vagina, and felt the hot slickness within. She took them out as Mark sank to his knees between her outspread legs.\n\u0026ldquo;What about sand in \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he protested.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s risk it!\u0026rdquo; she urged. \u0026ldquo;I need you in me.\u0026rdquo;\nShe dipped her fingers back into her new opening and swirled them around, making slurping noises. Mark watched entranced. He now looked twenty-five years old. His light brown hair hung about his neck and shoulders in curly waves, and his blue eyes shone like diamonds in the dusk. His shoulders were broad and strong, and his abdomen was ripped and tight. His still-stiff cock hung nearly eight inches into the air. She grabbed his pole with her slick fingers and guided him towards her new opening.\n\u0026ldquo;Now,\u0026rdquo; she urged, pushing her hips up towards his, enjoying both the feeling of anticipation in her groin and the feeling of her breasts jiggle on her chest.\nMark stretched out over her in a military push up position, holding his body straight, the tip of his cock nestled in her nether lips but not entering, even as she swirled her hips to force his cock into her.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t move,\u0026rdquo; he whispered. \u0026ldquo;Mutual satisfaction, remember?\u0026rdquo;\nShe stilled her hips and waited, watching his face as he held himself above her. Her body quivered in anticipation as she felt his steely eyes bore into her. Her nipples throbbed, and she wanted to pull on them, but a look from Mark kept her arms at her sides. She watched him look at her. His gaze traveled from her face to her breasts, and she arched a little more until she heard him clear his throat, and she relaxed back into the sand. His eyes drank in her slender waist, and flat stomach, her jutting hip bones and beyond them, her legs splayed outward, her knees relaxed against the sand, her calves pointing at his feet, pressed into the sand.\nHe hitched his hips a little bit, as the bulbous head slipped into her. She gasped with pleasure, feeling it stretch her open.\n\u0026ldquo;Relax,\u0026rdquo; he urged.\nTrixi struggled to control her breathing, feeling her chest rise and fall. She turned and saw Binah and Homa move into a sixty-nine, and then returned to gaze at Mark. He held himself above her effortlessly, and she reached up and ran her fingers along his shoulders and torso.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re supposed to relax,\u0026rdquo; he repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;My hips only,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;I want to touch you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fine,\u0026rdquo; he said, and began to lower himself towards her.\nTrixi grabbed his shoulders as she felt him push into her. His cock seemed huge, stretching her open, filling her. His body continued to come closer and closer to hers, slowly entering her. She kept waiting for her hymen to break, but never felt anything. First, their hips met, then they were belly to belly, then his chest pressed into her chest, and finally they were kissing as he bottomed out his cock, pressing his groin into hers. Trixi lifted her legs around his waist, and wrapped her arms around his neck, his tongue dueling with her own.\nKeeping their chests pressed together, Mark began stroking in and out of Trixi\u0026rsquo;s vagina. She closed her eyes and focused on the incredible sensations of his cock moving in and out of her vagina \u0026hellip; her vagina! She was deliriously happy. The warm sand on her back felt wonderful, and she let her body rock into the sand\u0026rsquo;s soft embrace. After several minutes of the most intense pleasure she ever felt without actually climaxing, she began to see colors swirl behind her eyelids. She opened her eyes, and watched as Mark lifted himself up a little bit, increasing the pace of his strokes.\nShe began to whimper with each stroke, feeling her body build a delicious tightness in her groin that moved in waves across her body. Her breasts were rocking back and forth, as Mark pounded into her. She was screaming with passion, her womb was beginning to tense up and the waves built in intensity and frequency.\nHoma and Binah turned their heads from their own sixty-nine to watch the beauty and strength the two lovers exhibited. Even Homa felt forced to admit that Trixi was not merely having sex, but what she and Mark were engaged in was compelling, sexy, and she felt her own passion rise unexpectedly.\n\u0026ldquo;Why am I feeling so \u0026hellip; so \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Homa wondered as she felt her breasts tighten.\n\u0026ldquo;Horny?\u0026rdquo; asked Binah, her own eyes glowing as she watched Mark pump in and out of Trixi. \u0026ldquo;Because they are beautiful, and we can see how happy Trixi is,\u0026rdquo; she said as she stroked Homa\u0026rsquo;s full breasts, feeling how swollen her breasts were.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know if \u0026hellip; if \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Homa said.\n\u0026ldquo;You won\u0026rsquo;t have to do anything,\u0026rdquo; Binah reassured her, suspecting that it was only a matter of time before the mermaid milk did it\u0026rsquo;s work on healing both Homa\u0026rsquo;s body and her mind. \u0026ldquo;No one will force you to do anything. Do you want to get closer?\u0026rdquo;\nTrixi turned and sensed Binah\u0026rsquo;s question, even in the haze of her own passion, and let one hand drop from Mark\u0026rsquo;s shoulder to wave them over to her. She let her hand rest on the sand as she turned back to Mark, watching the sweat build on his brow as his hips kept forcefully but still slowly hammering into her. She was nearing her first orgasm, but something seemed to be in the way, something holding her back. Mark was watching her face, trying to match his pace with her responses, building her up slowly.\nHoma picked up her outstretched hand and brought it to her lips, kissing it, while Binah settled down on the sand on her other side.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s it like?\u0026rdquo; Homa asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s wonderful \u0026hellip; ahhhh \u0026hellip; it really \u0026hellip;. Oh, my \u0026hellip; god \u0026hellip; really is wonderful,\u0026rdquo; she gasped as her body tensed even further.\nTrixi brought Homa\u0026rsquo;s hand to her own and sucked on her fingers, moaning and whimpering as Mark increased his speed. The wet sounds of their hips slapping together filled the night air, mixing with the gentle sounds of the surf along the shore. Mark paused, put one arm around Trixi\u0026rsquo;s slender waist, and pressed her to his crotch. He lifted her hips as he sat up and brought his own knees under her ass. His cock pressed up into her G-spot, and Trixi groaned.\n\u0026ldquo;Lift her up onto your laps,\u0026rdquo; he told the two other women. \u0026ldquo;Hold her.\u0026rdquo;\nHoma eagerly slid her own legs under Trixi\u0026rsquo;s shoulders as Binah slid hers under Trixi\u0026rsquo;s waist. Together they formed a bed of bodies over the sand. Mark began to stroke again, starting with long slow strokes.\n\u0026ldquo;Kiss me,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, and reached for Homa\u0026rsquo;s dark, curly hair.\nHoma leaned over, feeling her breasts brush against Trixi\u0026rsquo;s large endowments, and pressed her lips to hers. They licked each other\u0026rsquo;s lips, stroked their teeth, and chewed on each other\u0026rsquo;s tongues. Mark increased his speed, and Trixi rocked back and forth with the force of his thrusts.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, oh \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s so, soo \u0026hellip; good,\u0026rdquo; she whimpered, opening herself to her lovers, her legs spread wide as Mark drove into her, pounding, pushing, slapping, slipping in and out. Binah stroked her breasts, tweaking her nipples, and Trixi felt the bloom of her long awaited orgasm flower within her. She grabbed Homa\u0026rsquo;s face, lifted it from her own, and held her gaze, watching Homa\u0026rsquo;s face watch hers.\n\u0026ldquo;I \u0026hellip; love \u0026hellip; youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Trixi screamed as Mark\u0026rsquo;s hips moved like a whirlwind and the damn within her womb broke.\nHoma watched with fascination as Trixi\u0026rsquo;s face contorted with such beauty and such agony that she could not turn away. She brought her hands up to Trixi\u0026rsquo;s, feeling her grip her face as she convulsed in her orgasm. Trixi\u0026rsquo;s eyes were still open, but Homa was sure she wasn\u0026rsquo;t seeing anything other than an explosion of color and light. Mark felt Trixi clamp down on his cock, and he thrust in as hard as he could and held his cock there for several seconds until he could no longer hold back, his own orgasm finally arriving. He roared out into the night as his seed splashed hotly within her, lifting her again into the very apex of pleasure as his splashing cock set off another orgasm within her quaking womb.\n\u0026ldquo;That was incredible,\u0026rdquo; Binah said, her own breathing heavy and quick.\n\u0026ldquo;It was,\u0026rdquo; Homa said with surprise in her voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Ummmmererrrangioumphfffff,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said.\nEveryone but Petra and the children bobbed in the waters of the Moon Pool, twenty-eight mers, six of whom were either pregnant or had already delivered. Joy and Mac were in the lab cave, making several radio calls, and generally avoiding the Moon Pool during transition.\nMark and his girls were still on the beach, and Petra and the children played together in the corner where they kept food for these transformations. Between Petra and the other mers, at the edge of the pool, Esmée stood shaking. From the water, Wong, Shen, and Lin all beckoned to her, each of them having already transformed. Wong was supposed to go last, but Esmée seemed gripped by an unexpected fear of both the water and the transformation, and Wong volunteered to go before she did. Now, it was her turn.\nIt was over in a matter of minutes for the mermaids. Wong took a little longer than Shen or Lin because all the males exited the pool for merman transitions. Lin, who had twenty-six mers to feed from and the same number helping her mentally focus on the change, completed her transformation in only thirteen minutes. The \u0026ldquo;pool in the pool\u0026rdquo; was for Esmée to take only between seven to ten minutes, if she would ever get into the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Esmée,\u0026rdquo; Wong reassured her. \u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt, and it is over in minutes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wong\u0026rsquo;s right,\u0026rdquo; Shen said, her silver voice and shinning eyes enticing Esmée to overcome her irrational fears. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll be fine. Don\u0026rsquo;t you want to be with us?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; she gasped, holding her hand over her chest, fighting down her panic. \u0026ldquo;Just give me a minute.\u0026rdquo;\nPat and Phoebe shared a look.\n\u0026ldquo;Esmée, take your time,\u0026rdquo; Pat urged. \u0026ldquo;We want to compare some notes anyway. Why don\u0026rsquo;t you sit down and collect yourself, and when you\u0026rsquo;re ready, you let us know.\u0026rdquo;\nEsmée nodded and sat down near the edge of the pool, her future podmates leaping from the water to join her. She sat, shivering and naked among them. Wong\u0026rsquo;s silver and gray tail was just like his brother Tuo\u0026rsquo;s, with white highlights. Wong retained all of his Oriental features, unlike Tuo who had been slightly \u0026ldquo;Jason-ized\u0026rdquo; during his transition. Shen and Lin both had dark red tails, but Shen\u0026rsquo;s highlights were silver and Lin\u0026rsquo;s were golden. They were still recognizable as sisters, but not identical like Dawn and Sandi or the triplets. Esmée leaned against Wong, feeling his strength flow from his body, and ran her hands along his beautiful tail.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be O.K.,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;It is just my age old fear of water. I was fine yesterday. Je suis désolé.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be sorry,\u0026rdquo; Shen urged. \u0026ldquo;Vous serez bien, ma fille douce. We\u0026rsquo;re not going anywhere without you.\u0026rdquo;\nPat, Galina, Alexis, Phoebe, Emma, Sally and Eric gathered in a corner of the pool to share reports. The scientific mers among them had rigged several sensors in the pool, and even though they were still participating in the ceremony of change itself, they were observing the process scientifically as well. They recruited Eric for his special sensory perception that had proved adept at understanding complex scientific processes and ideas that he really did not yet know much about. They had already discussed some of their findings and hypotheses between earlier transitions, but there had not been much time.\nAs their conversation progressed, other mers began to listen. The pool was filling with siren cell symbiotic bacteria, krill, and other microorganisms, and Pat and the others were able to see their functions for the first time. The microorganisms caused the transforming mers to spin, they provided some additional biomass for the tails they grew, and they leached the waste secreted by the attacking siren cells.\nAlexis surmised that they also increased the effects of the bioelectrical influences, and that the siren cells were behaving like reverse stem cells of a sort. As the siren cells built up in the soonto -be-mermaid\u0026rsquo;s body, they started to change, differentiating themselves for specific tasks. Some focused on attacking bone or tissue, others became transporters, and others became builders, using the resources provided by the first two to rebuild or create new bones, tissues, and organs.\nEric explained that it was like watching a glowing, \u0026ldquo;living mermaid,\u0026rdquo; with each layer of the body visible as the siren cells changed, attacked or built, and then were themselves expelled from the body as the new mer began producing his or her own siren cells. The process moved through the body along the already established body systems, sometimes one system at a time, like skeletal; sometimes combined with two or more, like endocrine, lymphatic, and circulatory; and sometimes the entire body was lit up, according to Eric, like a holiday tree as siren cells worked throughout the body at once.\nGalina hypothesized that the final shimmering of light and ecstasy, a moment in which Eric described highly compressed waves of siren cell activity throughout the body moving from the core outward, was when their newly created DNA stabilized. The microorganisms that surrounded the new mer consumed the excess siren cells, causing the orgasmic like feeling.\nPat joked that Eric\u0026rsquo;s special talents made an electron microscope obsolete, though neither Alexis nor Galina were willing to give up on eventually securing one for their lab. Pat also argued that the change could eventually happen in as little as one or two minutes. If enough siren cells were at work, all at once, the speed of the change ameliorated trauma to individual cells making mers very quickly.\nThe conversation stopped as Esmée stepped towards the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m ready,\u0026rdquo; she said with some conviction.\nShe held Shen\u0026rsquo;s and Lin\u0026rsquo;s hands, and the three of them dove into the pool. The mers quickly reassembled into their circle, and Esmée swam to Shen.\n\u0026ldquo;You who saved me, give me my tail,\u0026rdquo; she said with some difficulty, her gills still not fully developed.\n\u0026ldquo;Drink,\u0026rdquo; Shen said simply, and pulled Esmée to her chest.\nWhen Esmée switched to Shen\u0026rsquo;s other breast, she felt the pressure for air in her chest decrease. With each new mermaid or merman, Esmée began to feel more and more confident, and less and less afraid. The amazing feelings caused by the radical build up of siren cells in her body was both healing and enervating. By the time she made it around the circle back to Wong, her body was glowing with power and energy. Esmée was barely able to hold back the power of the mermaid milk that engulfed her body. She felt the mental force of the mers around her help her keep it in check.\nPat watched with some concern as Esmée made her way around the pool. At first she was concerned for the girl\u0026rsquo;s mental state, but as the power of the siren cells built within her slender body, Pat worried that the pool itself was amplifying the cells' power, and that Esmée would not be able to \u0026ldquo;control\u0026rdquo; the change. She could feel the small proto-mermaid struggling to hold back the change, and she added her focus to that effort. Pat looked around the pool, and saw several other mermaids with their brows furrowed in concentration, fighting to maintain control of the forces everyone could feel building in the center of the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;Wong \u0026hellip; give \u0026hellip; me \u0026hellip; my \u0026hellip; tail \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; she said, her body rigid and stiff, Shen and Lin stroking her legs as they pointed towards the bottom of the pool.\nWong pushed himself towards the beautiful girl, her dark eyes fluttering with her physical and mental effort to hold back the change. His cock, stretched out before him, extendied nearly twelve inches into the water, and nearly two and a half inches in diameter.\n\u0026ldquo;Drink,\u0026rdquo; he said simply.\nThe second that her lips touched his cock, he erupted into a massive orgasm, pumping great gobs of semen into her mouth. Esmée swallowed the first spurt, felt the second one strike her face, even with the water to slow it down, and by his third squirt, the microorganisms had her in their grasp, and she was spinning towards the center of the pool. She relaxed her grip on the siren cells within her body, and immediately a great force gripped her, and shook her body again and again. Her arms were pulled straight out from her shoulders as convulsions rolled through her.\nThe force of her release pulled her legs from Shen and Lin\u0026rsquo;s grasp by, merging them almost immedately, lengthening, and changing as billions of siren cells rushed to do their work. Her tail was fully formed in minutes, flesh colored, with two sets of new fins extending from her hips and knees. Her hair had lengthened down below her hips, and floated about her in great halo of silky brown light, spiraling as she twisted in the water.\nIn seconds, blue scales swept up her tail, but her fins turned a bright red, and white highlights sparkled along her fins, flukes, and dorsal ridge. Suddenly a great shudder twisted through her body, and in less than seven minutes, it was over. Esmée was a mermaid.\nIt had taken her nearly four times as long just to drink from everyone in the circle.\nPetra took one last look at the sleeping children nestled into the corner of the Moon Pool Cave, feeling the familiar feeling of lust rise in her body after the new pod transitioned.\nWhy do I feel always feel this urge for sex after a new pod is created, Petra wondered as a shiver ran up through her body. She knew how and why the mers controlled actual contraception, so why would everyone have this urge to \u0026hellip; like \u0026hellip; spawn, she asked herself.\n\u0026ldquo;Are the kids alright?\u0026rdquo; Danni interrupted Petra\u0026rsquo;s musings, popping her head above the water, her own face flushed with desire.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, they are sleeping,\u0026rdquo; Petra said. \u0026ldquo;Are you as horny as I feel?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Definitely, but I had to check on the kids,\u0026rdquo; Danni said. \u0026ldquo;Damn, it feels like estrus,\u0026rdquo; she groaned, running her hands over her body.\n\u0026ldquo;Estrus?\u0026rdquo; asked Petra as she waddled towards the water, her large breasts swinging provocatively as she made her way to the pool\u0026rsquo;s edge.\n\u0026ldquo;Ask Galina about it,\u0026rdquo; Danni said. \u0026ldquo;She used to study estrus cycles in fish, you know where they can\u0026rsquo;t help themselves and have this great orgy of sex to procreate. Since we actually control our own conceptions, maybe this sex urge is linked to the creation and maintenance of our mer-bonds rather than offspring.\u0026rdquo;\nPetra nodded, and felt her breasts flush with sexual desire, her very large nipples stiffening in the cool air of the cave. \u0026ldquo;That makes sense to me. Are you going to watch the kids?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got to get back down to John, Pat, and Phoebe,\u0026rdquo; Danni said, breathing heavily. \u0026ldquo;The kids will be alright. The same thing that affects us makes them sleepy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What will happen when they get older?\u0026rdquo; Petra wondered aloud. \u0026ldquo;Who is going to have sex with them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Danni said with difficulty. \u0026ldquo;But I know who I am going to have sex with right now,\u0026rdquo; she finished as she ducked back under the water.\nDanni barely noticed Petra as she slipped past her on her way to her own pod, so full was the Moon Pool, charged with the residual power of the siren cells and the mounting sexual tension in all the mers. Wong\u0026rsquo;s new pod was in the center of the pool, surrounded by a slowly growing cloud of white mermaid\u0026rsquo;s milk. She could see Esmée\u0026rsquo;s French tri-color tail flashing with lights as it wrapped around Wong\u0026rsquo;s strong sliver and gray one. The Chin sister\u0026rsquo;s dramatic red tails twirled around both, each sister perched on one of Wong\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fins. Danni reached out with her mer-senses and \u0026ldquo;found\u0026rdquo; her own pod. She swam over to them, feeling the water caress her body as she sensuously swam through the pool, twisting around and between the various pods, all of whom were making love.\nJohn hung in his usual spot at the north apex of the pool, and Pat already had his cock buried deep inside her body. Phoebe was beckoning to Danni, inviting her to her spot on John\u0026rsquo;s right pelvic fin. Danni pushed herself quickly to her pod, feeling their shared, invisible connections jump with intensity as their physical bodies all made contact. John turned and kissed her deeply as she pressed her own swollen vent onto his fin. She moaned into the kiss, feeling the pleasant buzzing of his fin seep into her body, stimulating her clit, and making her hips twitch with pleasure.\nPhoebe reached around both Pat and John and grabbed Danni\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fins, using that leverage to pull everyone closer to John\u0026rsquo;s quivering body. Danni gasped as she felt her vent mash down on John\u0026rsquo;s hip, his fin oscillating like a buzz saw along the crease of her vent. She could feel Pat\u0026rsquo;s internal muscles milking John\u0026rsquo;s cock, her tail rolling with regular contractions as Pat\u0026rsquo;s orgasm approached. John put his arms around Phoebe and Danni\u0026rsquo;s necks and brought their faces all together. They shared a pod kiss, all four of them kissing, nipping, licking, tongues, lips, and teeth all mixed together as their bodies raced towards a shared, quadraphonic orgasm.\nDanni felt one of her long nipples poking John\u0026rsquo;s hard chest while her other pressed into one of Pat\u0026rsquo;s enormous breasts. Danni could feel her milk building, swelling, pushing out her breasts until finally John\u0026rsquo;s fin triggered the orgasm she desired. She moaned and spurted milk into the water, shooting thick streams of white into their tangle of limbs, fins, and tails. Phoebe pulled sharply on her fins, pressing each of them harder onto John\u0026rsquo;s body, and both Pat and Phoebe joined Danni in orgasm, three complete sets of mermaid breasts all spurting milk into the water at once. Finally, John could take it no longer, and still holding all three of his mermaids together in a group kiss, began to pump his passion into Pat\u0026rsquo;s quivering womb. After several long pulses, everyone calmed down and relaxed.\n\u0026ldquo;God, we needed that,\u0026rdquo; Pat sighed. \u0026ldquo;Having kids cuts down on mer sex life, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean, you needed that,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe giggled, pointing to where John\u0026rsquo;s still stiff cock lay buried in Pat\u0026rsquo;s now satisfied body. \u0026ldquo;I need it, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure that Danni needs it too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, reluctantly pushing herself off John\u0026rsquo;s cock, watching it pop out, trailing a silky string of semen from her vent.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll get that,\u0026rdquo; Danni said, lowering her head and sucking the strand in like spaghetti,\nAn hour later, when John\u0026rsquo;s pod went to check on the kids, none of them had yet awoken. As they looked back into the Moon Pool, they saw that Wong\u0026rsquo;s pod was still in the center of the pool, still twisting behind a thick cloud of white mermaid\u0026rsquo;s milk that flashed with color and light, and that even in the cave, they could still hear his mermaids screaming out their passion in several different languages.\nTrixi watched with astonishment as thirty-six mers swam up onto the beach in the late morning sun, thirty-six mers plus Joy and Mac, who were being \u0026ldquo;pushed\u0026rdquo; by Eric\u0026rsquo;s pod. The rush of color, power, grace, and the silvery sound of the mer voices filled her senses. Eric and Liga each pushed one of Mac\u0026rsquo;s feet, while Sally and Alexis pushed Joy. Unknown to Mark\u0026rsquo;s proto-pod, Mac and his daughter\u0026rsquo;s pod had decided to put on a show.\nStarting just inside the reef, Joy and Mac ducked under the water and then burst upwards a few meters further towards the beach, twirling into the air as their mers stayed at the surface, pacing the humans who sailed above them in the air. Joy and Mac arched back into the water together, and then rose to their surfing positions after only a few meters, the mers seamlessly joining them on their way to the beach. Again they leapt into the air, and both Mac and Joy performed \u0026ldquo;almost\u0026rdquo; graceful forward summersaults, laughing when they reemerged with their \u0026ldquo;team\u0026rdquo; pushing them from behind.\n\u0026ldquo;Bravo!\u0026rdquo; Trixi shouted. \u0026ldquo;That was so cool.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Homa agreed, her head leaning on Mark\u0026rsquo;s chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Do it again!\u0026rdquo; Trixi urged.\nMost of the other mers stopped in the shallow water to watch as Mac, Joy, and Eric\u0026rsquo;s pod put on a show for everyone. They performed many tricks; the last was a veritable fountain of mers and humans as Eric pushed Mac and Alexis (being the largest mermaid in her pod) pushed Joy, Sally and Liga came around from behind. Mari did her own tiny flip in front of the \u0026ldquo;pyramid\u0026rdquo; of bodies suspended in the air: two humans and five mers all spinning in the air at the same time.\n\u0026ldquo;Beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Homa shouted as the show ended and everyone headed for the beach. \u0026ldquo;God, I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to be a mermaid. They are so powerful and beautiful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What kinds of mermaids do you want to be?\u0026rdquo; Mark asked his girls.\n\u0026ldquo;What ever kind you want,\u0026rdquo; Trixi answered. \u0026ldquo;You did great with the woman part of the deal,\u0026rdquo; she finished as she ran her hands over her glorious breasts again.\n\u0026ldquo;Homa, how about you?\u0026rdquo; Mark asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I want to be a Phoenix,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;You want to be a bird?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked, dropping her breast from her hands.\n\u0026ldquo;Not literally,\u0026rdquo; Homa said giggling. \u0026ldquo;I want to be reborn; I don\u0026rsquo;t want to look anything like I have been. My name means \u0026ldquo;phoenix bird\u0026rdquo; in Farsi, you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I love the way you look,\u0026rdquo; Trixi complained. \u0026ldquo;I love your hazel eyes, flecked with gold, and I love your body. Please don\u0026rsquo;t change those.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For you \u0026hellip; I won\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;But for him,\u0026rdquo; she continued playfully poking Mark in the chest, \u0026ldquo;I need something to remind him that he\u0026rsquo;s not in charge.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A phoenix is a bird of fire,\u0026rdquo; Binah said. \u0026ldquo;You should have a tail of fire to match your eyes of gold.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what kind of mermaid I want to be,\u0026rdquo; she agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Fire,\u0026rdquo; Mark said, grinning. \u0026ldquo;That will remind me that you cannot be touched.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, you can touch me,\u0026rdquo; Homa said, suddenly fearful and childlike. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t think I could ever let any man touch me again. But after last night \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have to say anything, my little firebird,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;A promise is a promise.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I want a new promise,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;No, wait until next week,\u0026rdquo; Mark said.\n\u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t need to wait until next week,\u0026rdquo; Homa argued. \u0026ldquo;The mermaid\u0026rsquo;s milk has done its work, inside and out. I\u0026rsquo;m not frightened by you any longer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about him,\u0026rdquo; Mark asked, pointing to the approaching human walking up the beach.\nHomo looked at Mac, still powerful and handsome at sixty, and then back at Mark, who now looked barely twenty-five years old. She involuntarily shivered.\n\u0026ldquo;Trust me,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;You can release me from the promise not to touch you without your invitation some day, but not yet.\u0026rdquo;\nTears sprang into Homa\u0026rsquo;s eyes as she realized that even though she wanted to release him, needed to release him, she shouldn\u0026rsquo;t release him. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; yet. His insight and his tenderness compounded her frustration with her own wounds. Mark WAS someone she could finally trust, and she wanted to, but he was right, dammit. Her body and memories still wore the scars of her previous life. She buried her face into his chest and sobbed.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so \u0026hellip; so sorry,\u0026rdquo; she wailed.\n\u0026ldquo;I am so, so, glad that Joy picked you to be our mate,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, as she brushed a tear from her own cheek.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Binah said, putting her hand on Homa\u0026rsquo;s shoulder as the much shorter girl sobbed. \u0026ldquo;Me too.\u0026rdquo;\nShe turned to look at her soon-to-be-pod-mate, matching his even gaze. \u0026ldquo;I will be happy to be your mermaid, any mermaid, as long as I\u0026rsquo;m yours.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will all be each other\u0026rsquo;s,\u0026rdquo; Mark said, enfolding all three of them into a gentle hug. \u0026ldquo;No one will be mine any more than I will belong to each of you.\u0026rdquo;\nThey all squeezed in a group hug, and then they relaxed and encouraged Homa to pull herself together. The mers all salamandered up onto the beach, except for Danni and Petra who stayed in the shallow water to watch the children. Homa was still wiping tears from her eyes when Pat approached.\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; Pat said as she noted Mark\u0026rsquo;s arm around Homa who was seeking comfort in his arms. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad to see some things have changed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Some things have really changed,\u0026rdquo; Rose said as she saddled up next to Trixi. \u0026ldquo;You look great! How do you feel?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;GREAT!\u0026rdquo; Trixi squealed as she bent down to hug her mermaid mentor. \u0026ldquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t understand how finally becoming a mermaid will improve anything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s why I give the advice,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;No one would ever believe it without experiencing it for themselves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we have to be off,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, turning to his daughter. \u0026ldquo;You keep well, keep your head down, and I\u0026rsquo;ll see you in a bit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How long,\u0026rdquo; Sally asked plaintively, her royal blue tail twitching with anxiety.\n\u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t know, Sally Su-Su,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;We have much to set in motion, but fortunately, you already own this island and \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;We do?\u0026rdquo; Eric interrupted.\n\u0026ldquo;Several smaller atolls nearby,\u0026rdquo; Joy finished.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, a partnership of John Ackerman, Dawn Halbst, Trevor Green, Tuo Guo Han, and Hank and Janice Connor own this island and four nearby atolls,\u0026rdquo; Pat added. \u0026ldquo;We talked to Hank and Janice via short wave this morning. Congratulations everyone.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter everyone stopped hugging and crying, Pat added, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not out of the woods yet, but this was a big step. Mac and Joy will try to get the next steps accomplished.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why so few people on the partnership?\u0026rdquo; Eric asked.\n\u0026ldquo;First, some of us no longer legally exist,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained waving at herself and Danni. \u0026ldquo;Second, You and Sally were excluded for a bit as we try to keep Mermaid Island below the radar. We took a chance with Tuo, because he worked for Malaki through his son Manalo, but we\u0026rsquo;re betting that Malaki will never know that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because he is now a dolphin,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, laughing. \u0026ldquo;A fucking female dolphin.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mac!\u0026rdquo; Joy said, scandalized. \u0026ldquo;The children.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about that,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re building a whole new society out here, and I for one hope we don\u0026rsquo;t get hung up on particularly useful and flexible words like fucking.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But I never hear you say it,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Well, except for then.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The opportunity never arose,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, giggling at her own double pun.\n\u0026ldquo;Right, well we best be off,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;Saly, Eric, may we request one last ride back out to the plane?\u0026rdquo;\nPat watched as the six figures ambled towards the water. Mac stopped their progress before they got to the water and took Eric and Sally aside. He whispered something into their ears, and when he had finished, Sally shrieked, hugged, and kissed him. Pat smiled to herself, suspecting what Mac had shared with her daughter. If only her brother could be so accepting, she thought wistfully; it would almost make up for the awful memories of her father.\nLater that afternoon, Binah and Mark sat at the edge of the Moon Pool, watching Homa make her way around the circle below. Danni and the kids were nearby, also watching the amazing transformation. Trixi had gone first, and was now a beautiful mermaid with a blue and yellow striped tail with solid blue fins and flukes with yellow highlights. Her golden blond hair curled around her head like a benign Gorgon. Homa had just finished feeding, her arms outstretched as her body began to spin.\n\u0026ldquo;That is amazing,\u0026rdquo; Binah said.\n\u0026ldquo;It is,\u0026rdquo; Mark agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;I never get tired of watching,\u0026rdquo; Danni agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;What will happen to my hair?\u0026rdquo; Binah asked, pulling at her thick and lustrous Afro that bushed out from her head. \u0026ldquo;It would have to be ten feet long to cover my gills, and who could swim with that kind of hair?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Mark answered, kissing her firmly. \u0026ldquo;But you have a point about your hair. Mermaids need to keep their gills covered, and your hair doesn\u0026rsquo;t relax for very long. What kind of hair do you want? We can change it you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Binah said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m the only one here from Africa, and so I want to represent, you know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think I do,\u0026rdquo; Mark agreed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure that either you or the siren cell will come up with something.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You really think I\u0026rsquo;m beautiful?\u0026rdquo; Binah asked, looking down at her tall and slender body. \u0026ldquo;You made Trixi, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t changed much.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t need to change,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;A man may love to eat fish, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that he also doesn\u0026rsquo;t love to eat steak.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Trixi is right,\u0026rdquo; Binah said, kissing him again. \u0026ldquo;You are special. Why aren\u0026rsquo;t there more men like you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I kinda hope that I am the only me,\u0026rdquo; Mark said, stroking her ebony cheeks. \u0026ldquo;I would hate to have to share you three with anyone else.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we have to share you with each other,\u0026rdquo; Binah said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but I don\u0026rsquo;t get to share me with another me,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;Not that I want to \u0026hellip; or that there is anything wrong with homosexuality. Oh, this is stupid. You are beautiful! Trixi is beautiful, and Homa is beautiful; and the three of you could not be more different from one another. Nevertheless, I know I am the luckiest guy here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t think MuSu is the luckiest guy here?\u0026rdquo; Binah teased.\n\u0026ldquo;To each man, his own meal,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;I will be yours and theirs for as long as you\u0026rsquo;ll have me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think you\u0026rsquo;ll make a good mer,\u0026rdquo; Danni observed.\nThey all looked down to see Homa shudder through her final release. She was finished, her tail a stunning mix of fiery reds and oranges, with flaming golden highlights along her fins, flukes, and dorsal ridge. Her long brown hair still curled tightly down her back. As she pushed herself towards the surface, it reached halfway down her tail.\n\u0026ldquo;See how her hair is both curly and covers her gills?\u0026rdquo; Mark noted. \u0026ldquo;Maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to sit on the beach,\u0026rdquo; Binah noted, pointing to her bushy hair that only fell to her shoulder blades as she sat on the edge of the pool. The bright pink of her still new gills extended another foot below. \u0026ldquo;I would fry my gills.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll think of something,\u0026rdquo; he reassured her.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s your turn,\u0026rdquo; Homa said in her new silvery voice, her hazel eyes practically blazing with golden light.\nBinah smiled and stood up, stretching and wiggling her toes.\n\u0026ldquo;That will be the last time I do that,\u0026rdquo; she noted.\nShe arched into the water as Homa took her place next to Trixi, all the other mers except for Danni, who was with the children this time, surrounding the edge of the pool. With thirty-one mers in the water, they could all extend their arms in both directions and touch one another\u0026rsquo;s fingertips.\nBinah\u0026rsquo;s dark body glowed in the afternoon sunlight, and as she made her way around the circle, Mark found himself pacing. It took her forever to make her way back to Homa, and when she finished, the Moon Pool seemed alive with power as her body twirled, and bubbles surrounded her quickly morphing body. That hadn\u0026rsquo;t happened before, Mark thought. The water seemed to be boiling around the convulsing body of Binah, bubbles rising to the surface of the water, popping into the air of the cave, bursting with tiny \u0026ldquo;poinks\u0026rdquo; of sound.\nIt seemed as though Binah\u0026rsquo;s transformation only took a few minutes, and suddenly she felt twisted into a circle and the bubbling water stopped as quickly as it had begun. She straightened out her body and pushed herself to the surface. Her long, dark hair streamed down to the middle of her dark red and orange-stripped tail, completely unlike Homa\u0026rsquo;s bright, fiery tail. Binah\u0026rsquo;s stripes looked tribal, and her black fringes along her fins and flukes matched her shiny ebony skin. Her sinewy body snaked its way upward, her slender hips had widened with her new mer-womb, and her breasts were now probably a C cup, where as before she was a healthy B. She smiled at Mark, her dark hair shimmering as the water leapt from its hydrophobic surface.\n\u0026ldquo;Your turn,\u0026rdquo; she said, crooking her finger.\nMark was about to jump into the water when Pat burst up on to the floor next to him. Phoebe, Emma, Galina, Alexis, and Eric followed. They all started talking at once.\n\u0026ldquo;Did you see that?\u0026rdquo; Emma gushed. \u0026ldquo;The micro\u0026rsquo;s started the most amazing chemical reaction!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do the sensors say?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked as Galina waddled over to a portable computer Shen had picked up in Hong Kong.\n\u0026ldquo;Binah only took three minutes,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;Three minutes!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What happened?\u0026rdquo; Mark said, trying to make sense of their excitement.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yet,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe added.\n\u0026ldquo;Nano-bubbles,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said.\n\u0026ldquo;Nano-bubbles?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The siren cells in their bioelectric-ally agitated state create enormous instabilities in surrounding materials, like our bodies,\u0026rdquo; Alexis hypothesized, thinking her way through this one. \u0026ldquo;If the concentration was high enough, and some of them were extra, then they might start micro reactions in the water around the proto-mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Highly localized reactions that change the temperature of the water, forcing the gases in the water to be released in millions of tiny microbursts,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, catching the drift of the argument. \u0026ldquo;Each microburst releases a tiny amount of oxygen or carbon dioxide \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;And those nano-bubbles form larger ones until it looks like the water is boiling,\u0026rdquo; Emma said proudly. \u0026ldquo;Even though the overall temperature of the water doesn’t rise, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;Now all we need to do is figure out what is happening in those micro-reactions. Is there anything in the sensors?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Galina said. \u0026ldquo;There is an increased activity among the microorganisms, but I can\u0026rsquo;t tell you much more than that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Eric, what do you see?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\nEric turned to the pool and closed his eyes, after a moment, he twisted and hunched his tail forward, dipping his flukes into the water. After a few moments, he opened his eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;There seems to be much greater energy in the water than before,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t really see any individual microorganisms, but they seem to be coalescing into all kinds of shifting patterns. When I put my tail into the water, it felt like some of them came over and sort of \u0026hellip; I don’t know \u0026hellip; sniffed at me. Then they just left me alone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do we have any fish in that tank that are still alive?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked.\nDanni looked over the edge of one of the storage tanks in the cave and said, \u0026ldquo;One, but it\u0026rsquo;s barely moving. It should be someone\u0026rsquo;s dinner soon.\u0026rdquo;\nEmma salamandered over to the tank, grabbed the weakly flapping sea bass, and returned to the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;Eric, tell us what happens,\u0026rdquo; she said as she threw the fish into the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;A bunch of them are surrounding the fish,\u0026rdquo; he began. \u0026ldquo;Now new ones are coalescing around it, and now some new ones are penetrating the fish. The fish is getting better, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t changing. No, it is, but I can\u0026rsquo;t see how, but its signal has changed. It\u0026rsquo;s starting to swim towards the tunnel.\u0026rdquo;\nEmma ducked her head into the water and shouted at MuSu to catch the fish. He did, and returned it to her. She held it aloft, and it was flapping vigorously.\n\u0026ldquo;The Moon Pool is now a different place,\u0026rdquo; Pat observed. \u0026ldquo;We need to be careful about who comes in here and why.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will need to map out the spread of those microorganisms,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;And see how far they spread beyond the Moon Pool itself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think it is safe for Mark?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked, glancing over at the former SEAL.\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe,\u0026rdquo; Mark said firmly. \u0026ldquo;Only my own death can keep me from joining my girls. So, if you will all kindly join me, I\u0026rsquo;d like to get started.\u0026rdquo;\nWith that, he jumped into the pool. The mermaids shared a glance, and rushed back to the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;Stay where you are and monitor things,\u0026rdquo; Pat told Eric as she brushed past him. \u0026ldquo;Keep your tail in the water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Guys out of the pool,\u0026rdquo; Alexis ordered as she swam to her spot on the circle, her eyes wide as she watched Mark like a hawk.\nMark seemed oblivious to any danger, even as the water around him began to sparkle with light. The mermen quickly rose from the pool, and Mark swam over to Binah.\n\u0026ldquo;My dark, African queen, will you give me my tail?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re glowing,\u0026rdquo; Binah said in awe. \u0026ldquo;Are you sure we should start this now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Answer the question,\u0026rdquo; Mark said calmly.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, of course!\u0026rdquo; She answered. \u0026ldquo;Of course.\u0026rdquo;\nMark sank to her dark brown nipples and pulled one into his mouth. He felt the mermaid milk spill into his body, and he allowed some of his hidden fear to dissipate. He knew he was leaping into something unknown, but nothing would stop him from joining his girls. He quickly drained Binah and moved on to Homa.\nAlexis gave him a penetrating look, but he smiled and turned to his soon-to-be-pod-mate.\n\u0026ldquo;My bright, passionate firebird, will you give me my tail?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, oh yes,\u0026rdquo; Homa said, holding her breasts up for him.\nMark again felt the warm, sweet, and powerful milk course down his throat as Homa felt the deep stirrings of emotion that accompanied proto-mer-feeding. She cradled his head as he suckled at her breast like a baby. Soon he had drained her dry, and he could feel that the power of the milk was strong. He winked at Trixi and moved onto Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Mother mermaid, will you give me my tail?\u0026rdquo; he asked, feeling the power of the siren cell build within his body.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my brave and foolish SEAL,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;I hope this works.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course it will work,\u0026rdquo; Mark said confidently, as he lowered himself to her breasts.\nAs he approached her large breasts, he silently remarked to himself how similar they were to Trixi\u0026rsquo;s breasts. But when he took the first squirt of mother mermaid milk into his mouth, he felt an unexpected power spike surge through his body. He groaned into her chest, and tried to pull away, but found he could not. Pat fought off the urge to orgasm, and tried to form the words \u0026ldquo;get him off,\u0026rdquo; but she could not. She gave Phoebe a look of pure panic.\n\u0026ldquo;Something\u0026rsquo;s wrong; he\u0026rsquo;s already starting,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, pointing to his legs, already stiff and apparently merging. \u0026ldquo;Help me stop him!\u0026rdquo; she told Emma who was next to her.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, he\u0026rsquo;s reading at the same levels as Binah did when she finished with Trixi,\u0026rdquo; Eric said, dipping his head into the water. \u0026ldquo;Whoa, dudes \u0026hellip; this is intense.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What is intense?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe demanded, sensing some power growing around Mark and Pat, as she and Emma tried to separate them.\n\u0026ldquo;The microorganisms are going nuts,\u0026rdquo; Eric said.\n\u0026ldquo;Get him off her!\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m trying!\u0026rdquo; Emma said.\nPat\u0026rsquo;s eyes betrayed a panic she couldn\u0026rsquo;t voice, and Phoebe groaned.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll do it,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, as she moved over to Mark, and pressed her lips at the juncture where Mark\u0026rsquo;s lips met Pat\u0026rsquo;s breast.\nMark sensed something different, and recognized Trixi trying to kiss him. Her presence boosted his strength, and he pried his lips from Pat\u0026rsquo;s breast.\n\u0026ldquo;Take your tail, my love,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said as she placed her own nipple into his mouth.\nShe immediately erupted into an orgasm, as the microorganisms began spinning both of them, locking the two of them together. Her one free breast spurted milk into the water, which seemed to fuel the microreactions that were already starting, and soon obscured both of them behind a rising wall of bubbles.\n\u0026ldquo;What should we do?\u0026rdquo; Homa asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Watch closely!\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;You especially,\u0026rdquo; she ordered Eric.\nShe need not have ordered, Eric had his eyes closed and was gripped by the visions he could see with the pool. Great waves of microorganisms moved through and around the two bodies, one a mermaid, and one a proto-merman. Most of the micro\u0026rsquo;s moved through Trixi\u0026rsquo;s body without effect, but Mark\u0026rsquo;s body was wracked with convulsions and great waves of power. It looked like millions of tiny firecrackers all exploding throughout his body.\nFor Mark and Trixi, however, their experience was very different. They appeared caught in a time warp, or at least that is how they would later describe the experience.\nTrixi snapped her eyes open (though it looked to the rest of the mers that she never opened them), and watched as her own mermaid milk shot into the water in slow motion. Hundreds of tiny sparks of light seemed to swarm over her milk, in a few seconds, it was gone, and then another slow-motion spurt of milk pulsed into the water. Another swarm of tiny lights enfolded the precious fluid, and then she could feel a warm breeze brush past her. She knew that she was not moving in \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; time, and she turned to see where the breeze was coming from.\nThere was no breeze, she thought to herself, underwater. She noticed that from all directions, below, above, and all around, millions of tiny sparks of light swirled around her, catching her tail and her hair, moving them as though in a breeze. The swirling got stronger, and suddenly both she and Mark were spinning. She could see the shocked looks on everyone\u0026rsquo;s faces as they slowly spun by, and everyone looked like they were moving in hyper slow motion. It was almost funny.\nMark pulled back from her breast, and smiled at her.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s happening?\u0026rdquo; he asked without any fear.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re changing,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Look,\u0026rdquo; she indicated his legs, which were stitching themselves together as they watched.\nMark looked down and it seemed to him that his legs were bubbling, that his body was being massaged from within, and that invisible hands were rolling, bulging, and pushing out against his skin. He looked past Trixi at the faces of the other mers who were slowly spinning by.\n\u0026ldquo;This is different,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We are hyper-aware, and probably in shock,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;What does that mean?\u0026rdquo; Trixi said.\n\u0026ldquo;This process, what is happening to us, is actually happening very quickly, oh \u0026hellip; ouch \u0026hellip; that hurt,\u0026rdquo; he said as a convulsion rolled through his body. \u0026ldquo;But our brains are processing everything at a super high rate of comprehension. So everything seems to slow down. Have you ever been in an accident before?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, watching Mark\u0026rsquo;s legs lengthen into the proportions of a merman\u0026rsquo;s tail.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s like that,\u0026rdquo; he continued, groaning as his body morphed. \u0026ldquo;Time slows down, not literally, but it seems that way because our brains notice every little thing.\u0026rdquo;\nThey watched as Mark\u0026rsquo;s body absorbed billions of tiny sparks of light, and billions more oozed out of his torso and face. Mark\u0026rsquo;s body seemed to waver, as though they were both looking at it through water, rather than in water, as siren cells and microorganisms surged through his body and the water around them. They watched as a wall of bubbles rose around them. It seemed to last for a very long time, and the bubbles seemed to move very slowly. Then Mark felt a great twist in his body, and his new tail rose behind him as his body arched backwards into a full circle as the bubbles disappeared.\nTo everyone else, both Trixi and Mark seemed frozen in the water, and then suddenly a wall of bubbles obscured everything. It lasted for only a minute or so, and then the bubbles disappeared, revealing Mark in the familiar circle of release, the sign of a finished mer. His black and purple tail shimmered with green highlights, his long sandy brown hair floating around his shoulders, and his steel blue eyes, bright and alert.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you alright?\u0026rdquo; he asked Trixi, reaching out to her and pulling her into an embrace.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I think so,\u0026rdquo; she said, her chest heaving, her body still reeling from the forced orgasm that ripped through her body. \u0026ldquo;That was so strange.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How long were we changing?\u0026rdquo; Mark asked, looking around at the shocked faces of the mermaids that surrounded him.\n\u0026ldquo;About a minute or two at the most,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, her voice filled with shock and awe.\nBinah rushed over to him, Homa right beside her.\n\u0026ldquo;We were so worried,\u0026rdquo; Binah said. \u0026ldquo;That was scary. Are you sure that you\u0026rsquo;re alright?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Trixi, you were so brave,\u0026rdquo; Homa said. \u0026ldquo;And Mark you were so stupid. You should have waited for Pat and the others to figure out what happened.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And leave you without your mate, your knight in shining armor?\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;Not a chance.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t need a knight,\u0026rdquo; Homa snapped. After a moment, she said, \u0026ldquo;I just need you,\u0026rdquo; and she wrapped her arms around both Trixi and Mark.\n\u0026ldquo;Is everyone else alright?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked, her arms around Pat who was slowly recovering.\nEven as all the mermaids nodded, Phoebe reached out with her mer-senses and took stock of everyone\u0026rsquo;s condition. They were all surprised, but no one seemed hurt, not even Mark and Trixi.\nSuddenly the mermen plunged into the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;What the hell was that?\u0026rdquo; John demanded, rushing over to Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;But we\u0026rsquo;re alright; everyone is alright.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What did the computer say?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked Gabriel.\n\u0026ldquo;It is running the diagnostics right now, but we won\u0026rsquo;t know the results for at least an hour,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Damn computers,\u0026rdquo; Galina growled.\n\u0026ldquo;What was strange?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked Trixi. \u0026ldquo;You said something was strange.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, that. It seemed like we were in those bubbles for five or ten minutes,\u0026rdquo; Trixi answered. \u0026ldquo;Mark said something about shock and hyper alert brain functioning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is strange,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe agreed. \u0026ldquo;But we will have to talk about this after we all get rid of the sexual compulsions from the transition.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I feel so strange,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong?\u0026rdquo; John asked. \u0026ldquo;What does it feel like?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I feel light headed,\u0026rdquo; she answered. \u0026ldquo;Sort of dizzy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t feel horny?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked, puzzled.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said languidly. \u0026ldquo;I just feel strange \u0026hellip; good strange.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get you out of this micro-infused water,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;They have all settled to the bottom of the pool,\u0026rdquo; Eric reported.\n\u0026ldquo;You can see that?\u0026rdquo; John snapped.\n\u0026ldquo;He can see that,\u0026rdquo; Pat said languidly. \u0026ldquo;He can, I trust him.\u0026rdquo; She giggled. \u0026ldquo;I feel high.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, me too,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;I haven\u0026rsquo;t felt that way in a while.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god,\u0026rdquo; Petra gasped.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong?\u0026rdquo; asked Gabriel.\n\u0026ldquo;I am so horny, way more than normal,\u0026rdquo; she groaned, running her hands along her body. \u0026ldquo;God, I need you NOW!\u0026rdquo; She shouted at Gabriel.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, that\u0026rsquo;s it,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed as she ran her hands over her body. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m really, really horny.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the changed pool,\u0026rdquo; Alexis surmised. \u0026ldquo;We are all going to be even hornier after a transition. Quick everyone back to your pods.\u0026rdquo;\nWithin seconds, the pods were collapsing around their mermen, tails and bodies writhing with passion. It even affected Danni above in the cave, and she too plunged back into the pool, the children left sleeping on the cave floor.\nMark turned to his pod, his groin suddenly on fire with pain. He instinctively pulled on his new muscle, and freed his angry cock. It arched into the water, throbbing with need.\n\u0026ldquo;God, it\u0026rsquo;s never felt like that,\u0026rdquo; he whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s never looked like that,\u0026rdquo; Homa whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you want to go first?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked, her own chest swelling with passion, her nipples feeling like two points of fire in the cool water.\n\u0026ldquo;Can I?\u0026rdquo; Homa asked, her body shaking with lust.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Binah answered, and pushed herself onto Mark\u0026rsquo;s quivering pelvic fin, immediately bursting into an orgasm. Her dark chocolate breasts spurted bright, white milk into the water.\nHoma watched as Trixi pushed herself onto Mark\u0026rsquo;s other fin, and began moaning as his fin buzzed along her swollen vent. She hung back, staring at her pod-mates as they made love.\n\u0026ldquo;You have to ask,\u0026rdquo; Mark said through gritted teeth, his cock aching with need. \u0026ldquo;I promised. Please ask,\u0026rdquo; he pleaded.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Homa said, startled out of her trance. \u0026ldquo;Please touch me! Please fuck me!\u0026rdquo;\nMark reached out firmly and guided Homa towards his cock. Binah reached over, recovering slightly from her orgasm, and guided his cock into Homa\u0026rsquo;s vent. As soon as it was a little bit in, he grabbed both of her pelvic fins and pulled her all the way onto his cock. Together, they both exploded into orgasms. Trixi followed quickly and seconds later, Binah joined them. For a minute or more, all four of them shook and moaned as they shared their orgasms.\nAs the white milk slowly dissipated from the cloud that now surrounded them, Trixi murmured, \u0026ldquo;Now that\u0026rsquo;s what I call mutual satisfaction.\u0026rdquo;\nThe next afternoon, the pods gathered in the lab cave as Pat explained the findings they had discovered after analyzing the data from the recording sensors.\n\u0026ldquo;The pool is officially a change agent, all by itself,\u0026rdquo; she concluded. \u0026ldquo;We had better find a way to warn Joy and Mac.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked, looking quickly at Eric.\n\u0026ldquo;Because they may already been affected by the changed pool,\u0026rdquo; Eric said slowly. \u0026ldquo;And they could start changing at any time.\u0026rdquo;\nTo be continued?\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/changes-in-paradise12/","tags":["mermaids","transgender","transformation"],"title":"Changes in Paradise: Part 12 - SEALS, Surprises, and Steadfastness"},{"categories":["Mermaids"],"contents":"The saga continues, Pat and the scientists experiment with mer-bonds, the Connors return to Mermaid Island, Joy and Mac find a mole in Malaki\u0026rsquo;s organization, the mers learn more about their new bodies and capabilities, and Rose discovers a secret about their mer-organs.\nA lone figure rested on the pure white sand of a pristine tropical beach. She was a nautical goddess, a creature of that heretofore only existed in fantasy, a mermaid. Her long, red hair cascaded over her shoulders - the bottom of her tresses spread themselves over the damp sand of the beach. She arched her back, pushing her breasts toward the setting sun and dipped the pink fringes that dangled from the flukes of her shimmering sea-green fish-tail into the water as another wave rushed toward her.\nPat shuddered in delight as the water rose along her tail. The water felt warm and refreshing, but that had little to do with her joy. It was the way the water enhanced the unseen (to her at least) connections between her and her fellow pod mates who were swimming around in the lagoon a few meters away. She could feel the receptors embedded in her fringes along her flukes, mid-tail fins, and dorsal ridge tingle with energy as the water carried the bioelectrical signals from her pod mates to her. She was most thrilled with the connection she felt to her daughter, Maureen, who was playing with her pod sisters, Freya and Cynthia in the shallow waters. A child of her own womb, Maureen\u0026rsquo;s signal nearly overwhelmed the others, sparkling with energy and color. Danni, Pat\u0026rsquo;s own sister-wife, was the next strongest as she was watching the children, again, while Pat\u0026rsquo;s other sister-wife, Phoebe and the trio\u0026rsquo;s husband and pod leader, John, caught fish below. At least that\u0026rsquo;s what they were supposed to be doing; the faint pulsing of their connections suggested that they were engaged in another activity. Pat\u0026rsquo;s breathing quickened as she remembered her own love making with John earlier that morning.\nPat was relaxing for a bit. She and her more scientifically inclined counterparts had spent most of the day studying the newest behavior of their nautical sanctum - the Moon Pool. Their own presence there had apparently made the pool a change agent. The effects of their \u0026ldquo;siren cells\u0026rdquo; the mers released during their sexual encounters had altered the biology of several different species of bacteria and micro-organisms that inhabited the system of underwater caves they called home, causing these organisms to exert their own effects on any creature that entered the pool. Even as her own pod relaxed, other mers were trying to get a message to Mac Bennett and Joy Simpson to warn them that they may have been unintentionally exposed to the metamorphic powers that the Moon Pool now held on its own.\nThings were changing on this little island that was, quite literally, in the middle of nowhere. But that was really nothing new. Pat scanned the beach and remembered landing there with John nearly two and a half years ago. When she first set foot on this very beach, \u0026ldquo;she\u0026rdquo; was a \u0026ldquo;he.\u0026rdquo; Now, she thought as she sprayed water across her torso and face with a flip of her tailfin, she didn\u0026rsquo;t even have feet to set anywhere. Not that she minded, of course, like all of her fellow creatures, she was thrilled to be a mer, and couldn\u0026rsquo;t remember anything about her life before that was nearly as appealing as the life she had now.\nPat looked into the water and smiled. A school of painted shellfish swam by. It was the secretions of these gender-changing fish that Pat had first synthesized into a healing salve. She (he) and John used it to heal their wounds when they first arrived on this island. Eventually, the gender changing influences of the fish DNA made Pat into a woman, John\u0026rsquo;s fantasy woman no less, and John into a specimen of ravishing masculinity. Pat\u0026rsquo;s womb clenched as she remembered how the newly created couple had relished the opportunity to experience this paradise together. It was really her (or his) first romantically satisfying sexual experience.\nThey weren\u0026rsquo;t alone for very long though. Daniel Sherman literally washed up on their beach. He was hobbled and left to drown by the henchmen of a drug lord, Malaki, who eventually became the group\u0026rsquo;s unknown nemesis. To heal Daniel, they gave him the goop Pat had created, and he became Danni. Pat nearly laughed out loud as she watched Danni and their three daughters surface as they played a game of follow the leader. Yes, their small group was growing, but her smile faded as she remembered their early days on the island, before they were mers.\nRefugees from the drug gang kept coming. All of them found new lives with Pat\u0026rsquo;s group, and several found new genders. Michelle became Michael while Peter became Petra. They also discovered that the fish goop exacted some sacrifices from the humans it helped. The changes they experienced caused them to bond tightly into \u0026ldquo;pods\u0026rdquo; of several females to one male. If two males were alone in the company of a single female, they were overwhelmed by feelings of aggression. But if one bonded female accompanied each male, harmony was easily maintained. The new pods formed around Michael, with his former sister Gail and Petra, while Petra\u0026rsquo;s niece, Phoebe, joined Pat and Danni as sister-wives to John.\nWhen the thug Alberto and his men took over the island, things got really interesting. Confined to the water, the group noticed that they were subject to the continuing effects of the goop that each produced in their own sexual fluids. Unknown to them at the time, their bodies were already internally changing, developing new sets of organs that shaped the external changes they were noticing. Taking the fish by the fins, so to speak, it was Phoebe who thought to use the mental focus of the group to direct her changes into a mermaid. The combination of their proto-mer-organs, Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s intense desire, and blind luck resulted in a miracle, a one in a billion shot that paid off in a multitude of ways. Within days, everyone had transformed themselves into the beautiful creatures they now were.\nExploiting their command of the seas, the newly created mers rescued Alberto\u0026rsquo;s hostages. Their freedom came with consequences as the mermaid milk that healed them from the abuse they had suffered at the hands of their captors also set them on the road to life as mers. Of the two Chinese girls they rescued, Shou Lin took a new name, Xing, to go with her new form as she completed Michael\u0026rsquo;s pod while Mai Lin transitioned to a merman, Mu Su, to lead a new pod of mermaids, identical (finally) triplets, Rikki, Cleo and Emma (who had been Martin when he walked with a pair of legs.)\nPat shuddered at the memory of the final battle. Taking back the island from the thugs had taken a terrible toll. They lost Michael to Alberto\u0026rsquo;s hidden gun. The attack was too swift and devastating to give him a chance to recover with their amazing, siren-cell enriched, mermaid milk. So, he was lost, and Gail became Gabriel to lead their pod - which was soon to grow with the daughter Michael had created with Petra.\nSaka and Angra, lesbian lovers held in service to Alberto, had been the key to their victory. So they were allowed to join the mers as well. Saka could not bear to be with a man, so she became one instead as the merman, Agba. To fill out their pod, they took the young man, Laken, and forcibly made him into the beautiful mermaid, Liga.\nExploring their surroundings bought more than the mers could have imagined. They discovered a sunken secret Russian submarine filled with research equipment. Far more valuable than any equipment, they located the only survivors from the sub. The pair of castaways, Russian scientists Grishna and Alexander, were at death\u0026rsquo;s door from exposure and starvation. Faced with the option of certain death as humans or life as mermaids, they opted for life and took on their new forms as Galina and Alexis.\nIt was around this time that the visitors to the island became less victims of circumstance or people in dire peril. Sally Bennett and Eric Edwards, recently of the U.S Navy, arrived to fulfill life long dreams of becoming mers. They achieved it, but only after Agba and Angara were lost to yet another servant to the Drug King Pin. They joined with Liga and Alexis who were carrying the daughters of the now dead Agba.\nNext to visit the island were the Connors family - who sought to rescue Pat(rick) and John. When they got there, they quickly found that the pair hardly needed rescuing. Hank and his wife, Janice, left the island with their daughters, Kate and Ann, but Pat knew they would be returning soon. They left their son, Robbie, and a former intern, Trevor. Neither of them would voluntarily submit to a gender change, but each wagered their masculinity on their desire to become mers. Robbie (or Rose) lost the battle, but it would be impossible to convince the mermaid that she had not won the war.\nMore would be rescuers arrived in the form of Bill and Mae Williams, Mae\u0026rsquo;s sister, Eve, and her friends Sandy and Dawn Halbst. Dawn\u0026rsquo;s cure from cancer by the mermaid milk was one of Pat\u0026rsquo;s most triumphant accomplishments, although, again, fate intervened and aligned the pods in a way no one had imagined. Turi, a merciless killer, bought Tuo, Tiki and Rangi to the island in search of the drug lord\u0026rsquo;s money. When Turi nearly killed the three of them as well as Sandy and Dawn, the milk\u0026rsquo;s influence over Sandy and Tuo dictated that Tuo become a pod leader to the mermaids, Sandi, Dawn and Eve. Meanwhile, Bill added the honorable mermaids, the transformed Timi and Ragi, to his union with Mae. In spite of all of the changing of genders and forms, Turi experienced the most profound change yet - as the mers changed him into Tutu, a female dolphin.\nFinally, with Tuo\u0026rsquo;s help, Shen Chin was able to free her sister, Lin, and several others from forced prostitution at the hands of Shen\u0026rsquo;s, former boss, the drug kingpin, Maliki. Shen and Lin formed yet another pod with Tuo\u0026rsquo;s formerly disabled brother, Wong, and the French beauty, Esmee. At nearly the same time, Joy called an old friend, a former Navy SEAL, Mark, to lead another pod populated by African beauty Binah, the nearly transsexual Trixi, and (perhaps the most damaged of all the proto-mermaids) Homa. Pat hoped that the love of her pod mates would heal those parts of Homa\u0026rsquo;s being that the mermaid milk couldn\u0026rsquo;t quite reach. Shen also delivered Maliki\u0026rsquo;s misogamist son, Manalo, to the island. He would not be allowed to experience the joy of becoming a mer. Instead, he paid for his past transgressions by joining Tutu as another female dolphin, Mumu.\nPat sighed as she recounted everything that had transpired over the last two and a half years. There was never a dull moment on this island; that was certain. Danni surfaced again a few meters off shore, giggling loudly. It seemed her constant tickling and playing with the girls had come back to haunt her as she was now being assaulted in a tickling frenzy by a trio of young mermaids.\n\u0026ldquo;I could use a little help here,\u0026rdquo; she cried out between fits of laughter.\nPat giggled and twisted her body back into the water, feeling the warm sea enfold her with its warmth. She concentrated on her swim bladder and sank beneath the surface, and then she flipped her shimmering seagreen tail to propel herself into the group. With her arms stretched wide, she pushed herself between her nieces and wrapped Maureen, Freya, and Cynthia in a warm hug.\nThen, extending her fingers to her sister-wife\u0026rsquo;s ribs, she said, \u0026ldquo;I think they could use some help instead,\u0026rdquo; as she grinned and began to tickle Danni too.\nJoy Simpson, former CIA field agent and now an emissary for the mers, stretched in the hotel bed, reveling in the softness that surrounded her. Even as she enjoyed the luxurious bed, her heart skipped a beat as she thought of returning to the sandy beaches of Mermaid Island. Well, six-hundred-thread-count linen was softer than the sandy floor of a tropical beach hut she decided, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as exciting. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to return to the island, but there was lots of work to get done before that could happen. She sighed, and then looked over to the French doors, admiring the bright and bustling city below their penthouse room. A snort from behind her brought a smile to her lips. Mac Bennett, soon-to-be-retired Navy Admiral and father to one of the new mermaids, was still asleep.\nThat old plane really ought to be junked, she thought to herself, feeling her bones snap and crack as she stretched again. Well, if they were lucky and good, it would only have to make one more trip back to Mermaid Island, but not for a bit yet. She rose to a sitting position, feeling her breasts swing on her chest. She looked down, and saw that they seemed perkier this morning than they had for a while. She pushed her long, gray-white hair away from her face and stretched again, finally getting her right shoulder to pop.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, at last,\u0026rdquo; she groaned softly.\nShe worked her shoulder for a few minutes, flexing it and trying to get it loose. She had dislocated it several times in her line of work, and it was one of the reasons she retired. It was not a good idea to have a slow gun arm if you were a secret agent. She rose from the bed to admire the view from their hotel. Beyond their private balcony, the morning sun was still only a half-circle of orange in the east, but the busy Hong Kong harbor was already filled with the sounds of birds, boats, and bustling people. Joy leaned her slender frame against the door and let the cool, morning breeze wash over her.\n\u0026ldquo;Now that\u0026rsquo;s what I call a great view,\u0026rdquo; Mac said as he rose, groaning, from the bed. \u0026ldquo;Oh, my back,\u0026rdquo; he said as he awkwardly rubbed his spine.\n\u0026ldquo;Not too bad for an old woman, eh?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Not too bad for any woman, I\u0026rsquo;d say,\u0026rdquo; Mac said as he tried to twist his back into a position of relief.\n\u0026ldquo;Here, let me help you, old man,\u0026rdquo; Joy teased as she walked behind him and took his arms into her own. She put her knee in the small of his back, and pulled back on his arms, popping his spine.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhh,\u0026rdquo; he said as the cracks echoed through the room. \u0026ldquo;How do you do that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Practice,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Now, get in the shower, we have a lot of work to do before we radio back to the Island at noon.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Slave driver,\u0026rdquo; he said, turning for the bathroom. \u0026ldquo;You know, I\u0026rsquo;m still officially on vacation.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;From the Navy, but not from me,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Besides, the Navy doesn\u0026rsquo;t pay as well as I do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Hank and Janice\u0026rsquo;s money, not yours,\u0026rdquo; Mac said as he stepped into the shower. \u0026ldquo;And we are using it, not getting it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wasn\u0026rsquo;t talking about money,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, opening the shower door and slipping in with him.\nThe large, luxury shower could hold at least four adults, and a built in bench could seat two or three people comfortably. Joy brushed past Mac and stood under one of the four shower heads that were all going at once.\n\u0026ldquo;I was talking about this,\u0026rdquo; she said as she grabbed his slowly stiffening cock in one hand.\n\u0026ldquo;Easy, you\u0026rsquo;re going to wear me out,\u0026rdquo; he said, stepping close to her.\n\u0026ldquo;Two days of flying! One in a heap of bolts and metal that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to fly, and then the long flight from Port Moresby to Hong Kong in an overcrowded Chinese jet,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, slowly stoking Mac\u0026rsquo;s cock. \u0026ldquo;That is what wore you out, not my feeble efforts.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Your efforts are anything but feeble,\u0026rdquo; Mac sighed, giving into her ministrations. \u0026ldquo;What work is it that we have to do today?\u0026rdquo; he asked yawning.\n\u0026ldquo;We are supposed to meet with my Chinese scientist contact, some government officials, then find a short wave radio to talk to the mers, and then visit an old friend of mine,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Old friend?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll meet him soon enough, and he will be most disappointed to meet you,\u0026rdquo; she answered, smiling as she tugged on his slowly stiffening cock.\n\u0026ldquo;How do you manage to stay so good looking and horny?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Trade secret,\u0026rdquo; Joy whispered as she licked his neck.\n\u0026ldquo;Is this old friend part of how you stay good looking and horny?\u0026rdquo; he asked, leaning back against the shower wall, letting his cock fully rise. \u0026ldquo;God, Joy \u0026hellip; you make me feel ten years younger.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Getting old is not for sissies,\u0026rdquo; she answered. \u0026ldquo;So, I have refused to age. As far as horny goes, I\u0026rsquo;ve always had an active sex life. It goes with the territory of being a field agent. But Mike is just an old friend, seriously.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t tell me any more than I need to know,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just glad we finally got together, forty years late.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the past,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, sliding down to her knees, rubbing his cock on her cheek. \u0026ldquo;Soon we won\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked, as he felt her soft cheek caress his cock.\n\u0026ldquo;When we finish settling up with Uncle Sam, and return to Mermaid Island,\u0026rdquo; she said, as she kissed his cock head, watching it twitch.\n\u0026ldquo;What will we do when we become mers?\u0026rdquo; Mack asked, as he looked down at his old friend of the past forty years.\n\u0026ldquo;A lot more of this,\u0026rdquo; she said as her mouth enfolded the head of his cock, her tongue swirling around the tip.\nPat watched Maureen carefully as her two week-old daughter swam with her sisters Cynthia and Freya. The little mermaid was already an accomplished swimmer, and she was making nonsense noises as she played with her sisters. Her Kelly-green tail flashed as she twirled around Freya, bumping into her pale blue sister in her excitement.\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re just playing,\u0026rdquo; Pat assured Danni. \u0026ldquo;Freya is fine, and she\u0026rsquo;s giggling too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s so crowded,\u0026rdquo; Danni said, frowning. \u0026ldquo;Why does everyone have to be in the Nursery Cave today?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;First,\u0026rdquo; Pat reminded her sister-wife, \u0026ldquo;not everyone is here. Trevor and Rose are surveying the two islands south of here and won\u0026rsquo;t be back until tomorrow. Second, all the other boys are out with Mark and MuSu experimenting with some tactical formations and hand-to-hand fighting, and so none of the mermaids can be near them, or all havoc will break loose.\u0026rdquo;\nBoth Danni and Pat shared a giggle as they remembered the look on John\u0026rsquo;s face after he got back from Mark\u0026rsquo;s first attempt to organize a mer-navy the previous day. Mark hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected the chaos that erupted when his girls arrived unannounced in the lagoon as he and the other mermen practiced hand-to-hand combat and stealth swimming. The practice became all too real after Homa shouted her encouragement to Mark as he grappled with MuSu. Eric had tried to calm down the combatants but soon found himself just as aggressively entangled with Mark and MuSu as they were with each other. John saved the day by ordering Mark\u0026rsquo;s girls to leave double quick, and once the mermaids were far enough away, the fracas between Mark, MuSu, and Eric melted away. It was a comparatively painless reminder that mer-bonding and merman-physiology were powerful forces that no mer could ignore.\n\u0026ldquo;Finally,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued, \u0026ldquo;we are trying to calibrate the sensors in the Moon Pool so we can establish benchmarks of transgenic activity in the pool when we aren\u0026rsquo;t there. That process should take another hour or so, right Galina?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; she answered, checking a small transceiver she had on a silver chain around her neck. \u0026ldquo;We should have something to tell Joy and Mac when they radio later today.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Excellent,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Transgenic?\u0026rdquo; asked Binah.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, sorry,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued. \u0026ldquo;It means morphing or moving genetic characteristics from one species, such as the painted shell fish from which I distilled the original healing salve, to another, such as ours when we became mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or moving genetic characteristics across kingdoms, like bioluminescence in fish that we changed into bioluminescence in the sea grasses to illuminate our caves,\u0026rdquo; Galina added, as she helped corral Michelle so Petra could examine a dark spot that had developed on her daughter\u0026rsquo;s left pelvic fin. \u0026ldquo;Those sub-routines on new sensors we made will take most of another hour to cycle through.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that what Mark and John were working on?\u0026rdquo; asked Trixi, remembering the strange system of pulleys, wires, and cages that they had rigged up the day before.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;Each one of those tiny cages has different tissue samples from several different species, some skin from both John and myself, and even some human samples.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Where did we get human tissue?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Some of Homa\u0026rsquo;s hair that was in a brush on the boat,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained with a smile towards the beautiful Iranian mermaid. \u0026ldquo;She had an awful lot of hair.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Has,\u0026rdquo; Homa said, shaking her long, thick, tresses, the tight curls shinning in the dim light of the cave.\n\u0026ldquo;We will see what the micro organisms do to each of the samples, and try to predict what the Moon Pool might do to anyone who wandered in,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe explained. \u0026ldquo;In the absence of any influence from our mer-organs, which is why we are all crowded in here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just worried that in the crush of all these mermaids our little ones will get hurt,\u0026rdquo; Danni worried.\n\u0026ldquo;I would be more worried about the adults than the children,\u0026rdquo; Petra said as her daughter thrashed her multi-colored tail, determined to return to the pool with the other babies to play. \u0026ldquo;Will you hold still, please?\u0026rdquo; she asked her uncooperative child.\nGalina and Petra held Michelle gently as Petra stroked the dark spot on Michelle\u0026rsquo;s lavender and black fin. \u0026ldquo;I think it\u0026rsquo;s just another mottle, like the rest of her tail,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, examining the fin closely.\n\u0026ldquo;Our daughter\u0026rsquo;s tails are changing their coloring?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Probably,\u0026rdquo; Galina said. \u0026ldquo;Human children are born with hair one color and it changes as they get older.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Eye color changes,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;And freckles, all kinds of things change as humans mature, actually. There isn\u0026rsquo;t any change in the texture of her fin, is there?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Galina answered, stroking it lightly, which caused Michelle to erupt in a fit of giggles. \u0026ldquo;Does tickle?\u0026rdquo; she asked rhetorically as Michelle squirmed and laughed.\nPetra released her wriggling daughter, and Michelle slithered back down her mother\u0026rsquo;s long tail into the water. She raced to join the younger children who were all swimming in various patterns and circles in the wide pool. All six tiny mermaids slowly swooped in front of Esmée, Lin, and Shen who floated at the exit tunnel, guarding against a baby breakout. They were all swimming together; Mari was in the lead now, keeping a slow enough pace for the newest mermaids. Other than Wong\u0026rsquo;s girls, all the other mermaids were lounging along the edge of the pool, enjoying the soft blue-green glow of the bio-lights, and some were braiding one another\u0026rsquo;s hair.\n\u0026ldquo;They don\u0026rsquo;t seem like infants to me,\u0026rdquo; Homa observed. \u0026ldquo;They act more like children. Are you sure they are only a few weeks old?\u0026rdquo; Homa teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Only three of them are that young. Ours,\u0026rdquo; Pat said sweeping her hand past Danni and Phoebe, \u0026ldquo;are only two weeks old, Mari, Liga\u0026rsquo;s daughter, is six weeks old, and Michelle, the oldest, is nearly four months old.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know that to be true, but it still seems impossible,\u0026rdquo; Binah said. \u0026ldquo;They all move like one or two year old children.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mermaids are born with greater physical maturity than humans,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe explained, smiling at her sister-wife Pat remembering their bet. \u0026ldquo;Human babies start crawling between six to eight months, and walking anywhere between their 12th and 24th month. Mermaids are born able to control all their limbs, which makes them much more developmentally advanced, compared to their human counterparts. They were also in the womb two months longer, which is actually a huge difference. We expect that all aspects of development will be quicker in mermaids as compared to humans.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How much quicker?\u0026rdquo; Binah continued.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know for sure,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;But we suspect that adolescence will commence in their seventh year, which is about double the speed of human children.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Binah said, pondering this new information. \u0026ldquo;But we will all have very long lives? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense. Usually species that develop quicker have shorter lives.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;But there are several reasons for those differences, the most important of which is the siren cell\u0026rsquo;s ability to change, rebuild, or destroy cells.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s it like?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked, interrupting, as she wove another set of seashells into Binah\u0026rsquo;s hair. \u0026ldquo;Having a baby?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which part?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked with a smile. \u0026ldquo;The making of or the delivery of?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think I\u0026rsquo;ve already got the making of down,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, blushing and studiously focusing on the next shell she was weaving into Binah\u0026rsquo;s shiny black hair.\n\u0026ldquo;No, you don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Petra told her, her particularly large chest swaying impressively as she shook her head. \u0026ldquo;You have no idea.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Conception is something more than the sex we\u0026rsquo;ve already been having?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yea,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s everything you\u0026rsquo;ve already experienced and a bag of chips.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No one says that anymore,\u0026rdquo; Cleo chided, working her own set of shells into Emma\u0026rsquo;s long, chocolate hair.\n\u0026ldquo;Whatever,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with only the slightest trace of annoyance. \u0026ldquo;You get the picture.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do you do it \u0026hellip; um \u0026hellip; conceive?\u0026rdquo; Homa asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You have to be careful, because it\u0026rsquo;s something that is very easy to do,\u0026rdquo; Pat warned. \u0026ldquo;While you\u0026rsquo;re making love with Mark, you have to look deeply into his eyes and imagine the eye color of your child.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You just picture their eyes, that\u0026rsquo;s all?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Petra answered. \u0026ldquo;But the orgasm is unlike anything you\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Homa protested. \u0026ldquo;Better than we\u0026rsquo;ve had so far?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Xing added. \u0026ldquo;You will pass out from the pleasure.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously?\u0026rdquo; asked Trixi, her own chest heaving as she imagined Mark drilling into her, making a child within her newly formed womb.\n\u0026ldquo;Definitely,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;When you set the trigger, as we like to call it, your birth canal will trap your pod-mate\u0026rsquo;s cock within your body, insuring a pregnancy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my,\u0026rdquo; Homa said, looking at her own belly.\n\u0026ldquo;How does the eye thing work?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You have noticed how the patterns of refraction in mer eyes is much more complex and reflective than normal human eyes?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, our eyes changed when we became mers,\u0026rdquo; Homa said, turning to gaze into Trixi\u0026rsquo;s brilliantly blue eyes. \u0026ldquo;I think yours are the most beautiful eyes I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, Homa,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, her own eyes misting with emotion as she gazed at Homa\u0026rsquo;s equally bright, intense, hazel-gold eyes. \u0026ldquo;I love you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, our new eyes have six different receptor cones instead of the human three, so we see color in greater detail. We also have a higher concentration of rods, which gives us excellent night vision, and a larger ciliary muscle around the lens that greatly improves how far we can focus,\u0026rdquo; Galina continued. \u0026ldquo;We also have our new mer-bioelectrical network that reaches into our eyes. When we gaze into our merman\u0026rsquo;s eyes with the intent to conceive, our pupils dilate and the same bioluminescence we can see in our tails is generated in our retinas, only it\u0026rsquo;s a very small pulse of energy. His eyes then respond with a slightly bigger flash of light, and that flash of light in his eyes triggers a hormonal release in our brain which then triggers the conception contraction.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Conception contraction?\u0026rdquo; Trix asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Remember how intense your orgasm was when you first became a girl?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, the blood rushing to her face and chest as she remembered the first time Mark made love to her while Homa and Binah held her upper body in their laps. \u0026ldquo;It was the most wonderful thing that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever felt.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And then the first time as a mer?\u0026rdquo; Pat repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I was so surprised that Emma was right,\u0026rdquo; Trixi nodded, her passion rising as she relived that pleasant memory. \u0026ldquo;My first mer orgasm was bigger, longer, harder, and better than the best human orgasm, and I had had several before becoming a mer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s because your mer womb is bigger, longer, and stronger than human reproductive organs,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;The hormonal trigger makes a mer muscle in your birth canal, one that normally exists in human anatomy but ours is larger, clamp down on Mark\u0026rsquo;s cock, creating something like a vacuum seal.\u0026rdquo;\nPat stopped for a second and savored the memory, closing her eyes, and let her body respond to the memory of those feelings. The other mothers in the room also relived their moment of conception, and the sexual tension in the room swirled around them like a rich, thick blanket.\n\u0026ldquo;Um, that sounds kinda clinical, and you all are acting anything but clinical,\u0026rdquo; Binah said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I can feel sex just radiate from your body,\u0026rdquo; Homa said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s getting me really \u0026hellip; um \u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Horny,\u0026rdquo; Trixi answered for her, weaving the last shell into Binah\u0026rsquo;s hair. \u0026ldquo;God, you\u0026rsquo;re beautiful,\u0026rdquo; she said to her dark-skinned sisterwife.\n\u0026ldquo;You think so?\u0026rdquo; Binah asked, shaking her head so that the complex hair weave that both Homa and Trixi had created, thousands of tiny braids each weighted down with a few tiny shells, slithered over her shoulders and tinkled along her back. \u0026ldquo;Keep going,\u0026rdquo; she urged Pat. \u0026ldquo;I like the way this talk is making me feel.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mermaid physiology insures our high sex drive,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, sharing a look with her pod-mates. \u0026ldquo;But it helps when your sister-wives are such wonderful creatures that you would make love to them anyway.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We love you too,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;Now finish, because the children are already responding to our pheromones, and that means we need to work through this arousal.\u0026rdquo; Phoebe pointed to the pool where all six baby mermaids were now curled together in a corner of the pool, asleep.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with the little ones?\u0026rdquo; Esmée asked as she and her sister wives surfaced. \u0026ldquo;They all just went to sleep.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pheromones,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained, stroking her own body as she talked. \u0026ldquo;When mermaids have a strong sexual response, like feeding for transition or even just regular sex fantasies, we release very powerful pheromones, and immature mermaids respond by falling asleep. Mermen, on the other hand, can barely contain themselves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Us adult mermaids feel it too,\u0026rdquo; Danni said, pulling on her own breasts as she stroked her golden flukes along Pat\u0026rsquo;s sea-green tail. \u0026ldquo;Finish explaining, damn it, so we can get going.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Anyway, because the vaginal contractions trap the male\u0026rsquo;s penis inside you, neither one of you can move, and so your conception contractions start. Normally the muscles around your birth canal, in both humans and mermaids, contract during orgasm. Those contractions can be larger in some women than others, and some women barely feel it at all. As far as we can tell, all mermaids are very conscious of their G-spot and vaginal muscles.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;G-Spot?\u0026rdquo; Homa asked, her chest starting to tighten as her horniness increased.\n\u0026ldquo;A cluster of nerves on top of the vaginal canal a few inches inside your labia,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued, pulling on her own breasts as everyone\u0026rsquo;s arousal continued to grow. \u0026ldquo;The hormonal release caused by the eye flash triggers these nerves, which also triggers our ovaries to release one egg, which is why we don\u0026rsquo;t menstruate. The conception contractions are a result of signals from our bottom bioelectrical mer-organ that cause those muscles to rapidly and repeatedly contract in a pattern that mimics the stroking that your merman would be doing if he could.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If his cock wasn\u0026rsquo;t trapped inside you,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe added, pushing and pulling on her own breasts, forcing her mermaid milk to arc through her fingers, spraying Pat and Danni with her sweet, warm, milk.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah,\u0026rdquo; Pat moaned softly as one Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s multiple streams of milk crossed her face. \u0026ldquo;Feels nice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What happens after he cums?\u0026rdquo; asked Trixi, as she watched Mae, Tumi and Ragi fall into a tangle on the other side of the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;None of us remained conscious after our pod-mate ejaculated into our womb,\u0026rdquo; Danni said, her own long nipples fully erect, pointing out into the cool air of the nursery cave like javelins, Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s milk oozing down along her shoulders and breasts. \u0026ldquo;And it takes a while for your vagina to relax enough so that your mate can withdraw. When I woke up, John was still trapped inside me,\u0026rdquo; she finished, her face and chest flushed with the memory of her conception of Freya.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, noticing that Sandi, Dawn, and Eve had stopped listening and slid into the water together.\n\u0026ldquo;So, why isn\u0026rsquo;t everyone pregnant?\u0026rdquo; Binah asked, her own ebony chest rising and falling as she struggled to contain her passion.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll have to ask the ones who are not yet mothers.\u0026rdquo;\nTrixi turned to where Emma had been sitting behind her, to ask, but saw that the triplets were locked in a jumble of arms, hair, and blue \u0026amp; white tails as they squirmed against one another.\n\u0026ldquo;That answer will have to wait,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said as she pulled Binah into a kiss, pressing her body against the length of Binah\u0026rsquo;s dark torso, her bright blue and yellow stripped tail entwining with her sister wife\u0026rsquo;s dark red, orange, and black one. \u0026ldquo;We seem to be the only ones left not having sex,\u0026rdquo; she panted as she looked around the room.\nHoma looked around the room and saw that everyone was now entwined in groups of three, and the room was filled with moaning, giggling, and the wet sounds of vents being opened and pumped by mermaid fingers and tongues. She looked down at her pod-mates and stroked her sister-wives' hair and hips as they writhed against each other, watching them as they brought one another to a shattering shared climax. Then she giggled as they both pounced on her, pushing her back into the soft sand of the Nursery Cave floor, showering her body with kisses and caresses. One of the wonderful things about her thicker head of hair, she thought to herself as Trixi and Binah stroked and kissed her torso and tail, was that she felt like she was laying on a thick, luxurious, silken blanket. Around her she could hear the other pods moaning, squealing, and yelping in pleasure as the mermaids satisfied their extraordinarily high sex drives. She gasped as Binah slipped her hand inside her own wet vent, twisting its way up her now longer birth canal, causing her fiery red and orange tail to vibrate against floor. She started to moan, but was cut short by Trixi\u0026rsquo;s breast which had been shoved into her mouth.\nHoma drew a sharp breath of air through her nose, and then formed a tight suction around Trixi\u0026rsquo;s swollen nipple. She could taste the sweet mermaid milk as it sprayed into her mouth. Binah\u0026rsquo;s hand twisted inside her belly, and she gave into the mounting waves of her orgasm, letting her body ripple and twitch in pleasure. When she was finished, Binah withdrew her hand, and the three of them shared a kiss.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re always so easy to set off,\u0026rdquo; Binah teased, her own ebony skin splattered with droplets of her own and her sister-wives' mermaid milk.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just glad that I can enjoy sex again,\u0026rdquo; Homa sighed, stroking Trixi\u0026rsquo;s face. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t think I would ever have another orgasm when I was back \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t!\u0026rdquo; Trixi interrupted. \u0026ldquo;That life is over.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Binah agreed. \u0026ldquo;This life is our life now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Our life,\u0026rdquo; Homa said softly, still quivering from her orgasm. \u0026ldquo;Life \u0026hellip; our new mer-life.\u0026rdquo;\nAbao Dimaunahan, the second son of Malaki Dimaunahan, leaned forward in his chair, looking across the table at Michael Thomson, the owner of Thomson Marine. Thomson watched Aboa\u0026rsquo;s left eye twitch as he waited for the small Malaysian man to make his next move.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure you have no more information?\u0026rdquo; Abao asked as he pushed a thick envelop across the table. \u0026ldquo;My father is most anxious to find his beloved first son, and the people who kidnapped him. I am sure my father does not want to believe that you had anything to do with helping them.\u0026rdquo;\nAbao leaned back and straightened the silverware around the faceplate that had the now anachronistic Hong Kong Royal Yacht Club insignia in the center. He was trying to imitate the disinterest he had watched his father feign in so many previous meetings. Malaki Dimaunahan was an impressive man, not large or tall, but everyone who saw him immediately knew that Malaki was dangerous. Abao, on the other hand, was rarely successful in his attempts to imitate his father, and was unaware of his failure to do so.\nMichael Thomson brushed his graying hair off his forehead, and took another sip of wine. He knew who Malaki Dimaunahan was, and had sold him at least ten yachts in the last fifteen years. He also remembered Manalo and Abao from when they were little boys. Abao looked and acted less like his father than Manalo did, though there was something obviously wrong with Manalo when he saw him a little over three weeks ago. He was especially annoyed because Abao had interrupted his lunch and was going to make him late for his highly anticipated meeting with an old friend.\n\u0026ldquo;Keep your envelope,\u0026rdquo; he said firmly. \u0026ldquo;You have all the information that I do, and I do not appreciate your implied accusation. Give your father my best; I will certainly be sharing my thoughts with him concerning this meeting. Now, if you\u0026rsquo;ll excuse me, I must return to the marina.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I visited your marina this morning,\u0026rdquo; Abao said, stopping Michael midrise. \u0026ldquo;It is such a beautiful marina. So clean,\u0026rdquo; he said sweeping his hand over the view.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, it is,\u0026rdquo; Michael said evenly.\n\u0026ldquo;It would be a tragedy if anything happened that made a mess of it,\u0026rdquo; Abao said sweetly, pushing the envelope towards Michael one last time.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, it would be a tragedy,\u0026rdquo; Michael agreed. \u0026ldquo;But you see, I have highly trained sanitation workers,\u0026rdquo; he continued with only a touch of menace in his voice, \u0026ldquo;and you should see what they did to the last people who brought trash into my marina. Have a nice day.\u0026rdquo;\nAbao watched Michael leave and then looked out over the harbor. Something was missing. He needed to find out more about the cripple they had loaded onto the boat. He believed that Mr. Thomson, the owner of the marina where Shen Chin, his father\u0026rsquo;s former secretary, had traded boats, was holding something back, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t guess what. He saw Mr. Thomson below him on the docks, and watched him as he returned to his boat. He greeted a stunning older woman with long gray hair and another man, also with white hair, who looked like a tycoon, and the three of them went onto a very large yacht that quickly eased away from the dock and headed out across the bay towards Aberdeen.\nRich Western playboy, Abao thought to himself, not an honest, workingman like his father and himself.\nThe sunlight filtered down through the clear tropical water, flickering across the eight mermen floating in their favorite sand bowl, the same one in which John had first discovered Pat and Danni using their gills for the first time. This time, however, the mood was very different.\n\u0026ldquo;I just don\u0026rsquo;t understand why that move can\u0026rsquo;t be adapted,\u0026rdquo; Mark complained. He looked across the circle at Tuo, who shrugged his shoulders. All the mermen except for Trevor, who was off on a surveillance mission with Rose, floated in the clear water about three meters below the surface. They had been practicing various moves and \u0026ldquo;throws\u0026rdquo; as part of developing an underwater version of martial arts combat.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps our tails are not feet,\u0026rdquo; Tuo offered.\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, they are.\u0026rdquo; John said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;And that could be why you\u0026rsquo;re having difficulty imagining how to use your tail in this move.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What you mean?\u0026rdquo; Tuo challenged, his hand pointing down at his greatly changed legs, watching his silver and gray scales sparkle in the dappling sunlight filtering down from above. \u0026ldquo;I have one limb, and it ends in a fin. This is a tail.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not technically,\u0026rdquo; John continued, flexing his own steel blue tail for emphasis. \u0026ldquo;We didn\u0026rsquo;t grow tails, as Pat keeps reminding me, we changed our legs. If we had tails, they would be connected to our spine, and then we would have great difficulty adapting any martial arts moves to mer combat. But we didn\u0026rsquo;t grow tails, we changed our legs.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why didn\u0026rsquo;t we grow tails?\u0026rdquo; Mark asked. \u0026ldquo;I mean, that\u0026rsquo;s what whales and dolphins did. They used to be land mammals. Why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t our genes alter us in similar ways?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, Pat\u0026rsquo;s the real scientist on this topic,\u0026rdquo; John answered. \u0026ldquo;But from what I understand of the whole idea, the key fact is that we didn\u0026rsquo;t evolve. We might have, if we had let time take its course, but when Phoebe realized that the siren cell could be directed or influenced by our own enhanced bioelectrical activity, we went from evolutionary biology to revolutionary biology.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No one has ever explained this to me,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;Tell me more, maybe after I understand what happened to my legs, I can make the mechanical adaptation to my tail, \u0026quot; he mused as he flexed his own black and purple tail, watching his green fringes flutter in the water as he tried to imagine his toes still under all that color and sparkle.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, first off, you\u0026rsquo;re right. Whales and dolphins did evolve from land mammals, and they lost their rear limbs,\u0026rdquo; John said, watching as the other \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; mers drifted closer in the circle in which they had been practicing hand-to-hand underwater combat. \u0026ldquo;While they still have vestigial pelvic bones, we kept ours intact. In fact, we kept most of our skeletal components of legs, knees, and feet. We just changed them to serve marine propulsion.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Could we really have evolved real tails, like dolphins, if Phoebe didn\u0026rsquo;t force the change?\u0026rdquo; asked Gabriel, remembering back to their first transformations into mers.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe in thousands of successive generations,\u0026rdquo; John answered. \u0026ldquo;But we skipped the normal workings of evolution because the siren cell is part virus and part stem cell; it allowed us to both destroy and rebuild current cells in our own bodies rather than having to create new genetic traits in our children.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No wonder the Admiral was so impressed with the power of the mers,\u0026rdquo; Eric realized. \u0026ldquo;We could create monsters.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We could,\u0026rdquo; John nodded. \u0026ldquo;But we won\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How can you say that?\u0026rdquo; Eric challenged. \u0026ldquo;I mean, not that I want to or anything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Think for a nanosecond about your mates,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said, joining the conversation for the first time. \u0026ldquo;Would you do anything to harm them?\u0026rdquo;\nAll the mers grew grave and stiff. Eric slowly shook his head from side to side.\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; John said evenly. \u0026ldquo;Each of us would rather die than see harm come to our girls. Soon, we will be able to easily protect them from thugs like Malaki and his sons, but how would we stop Russia or the USA if they thought mers were dangerous?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or China \u0026hellip; oh, shit,\u0026rdquo; Eric said. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right, I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine doing anything that would bring harm to my girls. Wow, mer-bonding is really powerful. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I could even \u0026ldquo;think\u0026rdquo; these thoughts when I was a human.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re still human enough,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;According to Pat and the others. We can probably interbreed with land-based humans, though any union is overwhelmingly likely to produce a mer because our siren cell \u0026ldquo;modifies\u0026rdquo; any cell that it touches, and they would insure that mer DNA dominated.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Even if we had sex with a human girl?\u0026rdquo; MuSu asked. \u0026ldquo;Not that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of it for myself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course you\u0026rsquo;re not,\u0026rdquo; John said gently. \u0026ldquo;But we don\u0026rsquo;t know. The siren cell is in our semen, and so it would probably thrive in a normal human womb and influence both mother and child. There is also a strong possibility that any sexual contact would start that human on an inevitable journey towards becoming a mer themselves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, other than not creating genetic monsters to threaten humanity, how do we protect our mates from a hydrogen bomb,\u0026rdquo; asked Bill.\n\u0026ldquo;M.A.D.\u0026rdquo; Mark offered.\n\u0026ldquo;MAD?\u0026rdquo; asked Bill.\n\u0026ldquo;Mutually Assured Destruction,\u0026rdquo; answered Eric.\n\u0026ldquo;How would that work?\u0026rdquo; Bill asked, twitching nervously. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not a military man, and this talk is making me edgy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Most people fear things that are different from themselves, and we have become very different,\u0026rdquo; John continued.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d say we\u0026rsquo;ve improved ourselves greatly,\u0026rdquo; MuSu countered.\n\u0026ldquo;I agree,\u0026rdquo; John nodded. \u0026ldquo;But Pat assures me that people like her own brother will likely lead the blood pack of religious crazies that will seek our deaths because we are Satan\u0026rsquo;s spawn or some similar label.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Talk about monsters,\u0026rdquo; Eric said grimly.\n\u0026ldquo;MAD?\u0026rdquo; asked Bill.\n\u0026ldquo;Mac and Joy are contacting each of the major powers, and providing them with proof of our power to create things for good, like those anemone that eat pollution, and things for ill,\u0026rdquo; John explained.\n\u0026ldquo;Like what,\u0026rdquo; asked Bill, growing even more nervous.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t even know,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;Pat, Galina, Alexis, Phoebe, and Emma have all sworn sallekhana, and they have forbidden anyone else to do so for this particular reason. The only thing Pat will tell me is that they are close to perfecting the ultimate bomb, a biological time bomb that could wipe out all life on earth.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A carrot and a stick,\u0026rdquo; Eric mused. \u0026ldquo;A really, really, big stick. So, as long as we can protect ourselves from thugs and religious nuts, the major powers will likely leave us alone. We can save the world, or we can kill it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t one of the major powers try to capture us to use this power for themselves?\u0026rdquo; asked Bill.\n\u0026ldquo;Sallenkhana and MAD,\u0026rdquo; John explained. \u0026ldquo;Mac and Joy are going to make it clear that if anything happens to us, the entire world will pay the price.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sallenkhana?\u0026rdquo; asked Bill.\n\u0026ldquo;Suicide caused by will or meditation,\u0026rdquo; John explained. \u0026ldquo;We can shut down our own mer organs if we concentrate hard enough. The girls have tested it, and thus if they are captured against their will, they have sworn to die rather than endanger the other mers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure which is crazier, Sallenkhana or MAD,\u0026rdquo; Bill wondered. \u0026ldquo;We can kill the world or kill ourselves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we have no weapon that will stop a bomb from wiping us all out,\u0026rdquo; Mark said darkly. \u0026ldquo;Only one that will wipe out all life as a retaliation threat. That\u0026rsquo;s not very many options.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The girls are working on several lesser bio-weapons that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t cause environmental collapse, but would make specific areas of the world very unpleasant,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;The hope is that the world will just leave us alone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;History shows that humans have been really bad at that,\u0026rdquo; Eric said.\nA few moments passed in silence the mermen all pondered the difficulties they faced.\n\u0026ldquo;While we wait to die, we still have our leg bones under this tail?\u0026rdquo; Tuo interjected. \u0026ldquo;Sorry to say, we must worry about Malaki and nutty Pat\u0026rsquo;s brother.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we do,\u0026rdquo; Mark laughed, breaking the tension. \u0026ldquo;So, we have legs still?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;More or less,\u0026rdquo; John concluded. \u0026ldquo;We can stand on our flukes, actually. We can\u0026rsquo;t walk, of course; our legs have been fused together by two new sets of bones at our knees and ankles, not to mention the scales that now cover our joined leg bones, but we can still balance and twist on those two sets of bones in much the same way we used to when we had two legs.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And we can do things with our tails that we could never do with our legs,\u0026rdquo; Eric chimed in, flexing his in the water, causing him to twirl in place.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t think of what I see below my waist as my legs,\u0026rdquo; Bill said. \u0026ldquo;Besides, I never knew any martial arts when I was human, so I\u0026rsquo;m not having to relearn anything. I just think of my tail as \u0026hellip; my tail.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think I understand,\u0026rdquo; Mark said, a gleam growing in his eyes. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go up on the beach and try a few throws, and I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to work out the new hydro-mechanics needed once I figure out how our own bio-mechanics work on dry land.\u0026rdquo;\nHe gave a quick hand signal, and everyone nodded. The eight mermen quickly fell into their now practiced formation, moving like underwater lightening towards the beach in a tight \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo; formation, their pelvic fins nearly touching. As they neared the beach, their dorsal fins sliced up through the surface of the water as the rising bottom forced them to swim closer to the surface. Then suddenly the mermen erupted from the shallow water, arching towards the beach about five feet above the water. In perfect formation, they all hit the damp sand and tucked into a tight ball, rolling up onto the sand. Each merman\u0026rsquo;s tail was wrapped over his head, stretching over and around his head, with his flukes laying flat against the small of his back, nearly even with his waist. Two or three summersaults latter, they all unrolled together, each facing a different section of the jungle, their bodies stretched out horizontally onto the sand on their bellies, presenting the smallest possible target to anyone hidden in the jungle.\nMark gave a short whistle, and everyone relaxed and rolled over to sit up. \u0026ldquo;That was the best yet,\u0026rdquo; he praised his comrades. \u0026ldquo;Bill in particular; you are finally getting the hang of that tuck and roll.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks,\u0026rdquo; Bill said, brushing sand from his chest. \u0026ldquo;I never thought I\u0026rsquo;d be back in the army.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Navy,\u0026rdquo; Eric corrected.\n\u0026ldquo;Marines, whatever,\u0026rdquo; Bill continued, \u0026ldquo;but it sure feels great to be young and healthy again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, when there are only nine mermen in the whole world, every merman gets to be in the Mer-Navy,\u0026rdquo; John said.\n\u0026ldquo;Now, you did this standing thing once before?\u0026rdquo; Mark asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, when Michael died,\u0026rdquo; John said with a look at Gabriel. \u0026ldquo;We sort of felt like we had to give him some sort of tribute. MuSu and I were the only ones who actually stood all the way, the girls sort of made it to their knees.\u0026rdquo;\nMark looked down at his tail, and then rocked backwards, gathering momentum. He pushed himself forward with his hands and rose up on his undulating tail. He wobbled for a second, but straightened out his tail, making it stiff, and \u0026ldquo;stood\u0026rdquo; on his flukes.\n\u0026ldquo;I can feel my muscles wanting to do things they no longer can do,\u0026rdquo; he said, his voice straining with the effort.\n\u0026ldquo;Relax a bit,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;Let you body re-learn how to balance itself. You\u0026rsquo;re working too hard at balancing.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn curled his own tail underneath him, and then using it like a coiled spring, rose up suddenly. Unlike Mark, John\u0026rsquo;s tail was still slightly curved, but everyone could see that the muscles beneath his scales were moving less frequently than Mark\u0026rsquo;s. MuSu rose up too and hopped over to John.\n\u0026ldquo;The hopping thing isn\u0026rsquo;t advisable on anything other than sand,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said. \u0026ldquo;It really hurts on anything harder.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Our best locomotion over dry land is still salamandaring,\u0026rdquo; John added. \u0026ldquo;But who knows, it might be useful to be able to stand up in a fight.\u0026rdquo;\nBill tried to rock himself up, but he kept falling over. \u0026ldquo;Damn it, what the hell am I doing wrong?\u0026rdquo; he demanded.\n\u0026ldquo;Over adjusting,\u0026rdquo; Mark suggested. \u0026ldquo;Like I was doing at first,\u0026rdquo; he finished looking down at his now more relaxed tail, slowly flexing himself up and down and side to side, seeing where the limits of his strength and balance were. \u0026ldquo;Although we have a very narrow range of stability,\u0026rdquo; he said, nearly losing his balance, \u0026ldquo;it takes surprisingly little effort to stay in our new center of gravity.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do it slower,\u0026rdquo; MuSu advised.\nBill shot a skeptical look at MuSu, and re-curled his tail underneath him. He flexed slowly, his arms outstretched, and slowly rose straight up. \u0026ldquo;Hey, I did it,\u0026rdquo; he shouted.\n\u0026ldquo;Then get ready for this,\u0026rdquo; Mark said with a grin, and launched himself at Bill.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you asleep?\u0026rdquo; Kate Connor asked the darkness that surrounded her.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; came the disembodied reply from across the room that, tonight, she shared with her sister.\nKate sat up and turned on the bedside lamp, and looked across her dormroom at her twin. Kate\u0026rsquo;s roommate was away visiting her boyfriend, and Ann had come up from UCLA to visit her for the weekend. They had originally thought that going to different schools might be good for them, to develop on their own, but now, over halfway through their first semester of freshman year, both regretted their decision.\nAnn shared Kate\u0026rsquo;s own blonde hair and hazel-green eyes, and both girls were tall and slender. They had their father\u0026rsquo;s strong chin and their mother\u0026rsquo;s generous smile, and the total effect was devastating, though neither girl paid much attention to the attention that they attracted. They were both wearing their standard bedclothes, a light tank top with boyshorts panties. Ann sat up too, and crossed her long, lean legs into a lotus position.\n\u0026ldquo;I keep on thinking about our talk this afternoon,\u0026rdquo; Ann said.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s amazing,\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you think?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, crazy is more like it,\u0026rdquo; muttered Ann. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve both been fighting over Trevor since we were twelve years old, and now our own brother steals him away from us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not really,\u0026rdquo; Kate corrected. \u0026ldquo;He just got to him first. Remember, there\u0026rsquo;s three to a pod.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I know,\u0026rdquo; Ann said sleepily. \u0026ldquo;Still, it makes me crazy that Rose is out there and we\u0026rsquo;re stuck here in California.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Kate agreed. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe Dad wants us to actually go to all four years of college when he and Mom are probably going back to the island next summer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We could learn more from Emma and her sisters in one week than we could from four years at college,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;And none of the boys at UCLA are nearly as beautiful as Trevor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Same for here at Stanford,\u0026rdquo; Kate agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;And now Rose has him all to herself,\u0026rdquo; Ann sighed.\nThey both looked out of the dorm window and watched the night sky twinkle.\n\u0026ldquo;Remember how beautiful the Milky Way was on Mermaid Island?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Ann agreed. \u0026ldquo;It was so big, so clear. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to go back. This is nuts.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you really think all three of us can be sister-wives?\u0026rdquo; asked Kate.\n\u0026ldquo;Emma, Rikki, and Cleo can do it,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;We can do it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but they are triplets,\u0026rdquo; Kate noted. \u0026ldquo;Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that make a difference?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nah,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re twins, that\u0026rsquo;s good enough.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about Rose?\u0026rdquo; asked Kate, crinkling her nose. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re talkin' about our brother, ya know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I know,\u0026rdquo; Ann repeated. \u0026ldquo;What? You didn\u0026rsquo;t like him?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, I love my brother,\u0026rdquo; Kate protested. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just, like, you know \u0026hellip; he\u0026rsquo;s Rose now, and, I mean, who is that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;According to Mom, she looks like Mom and acts like Dad, just like we look like Dad and act like Mom,\u0026rdquo; Ann said as she pulled her long, blonde hair forward over her shoulder as she reached for a brush.\n\u0026ldquo;When did she tell you that?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Just before I came up here to visit,\u0026rdquo; Ann explained. \u0026ldquo;But can you imagine a person who looks like Mom but acts like Dad?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Like short, dark hair, slender build, super-intense eyes, but more laid back, quiet and shy?\u0026rdquo; Kate mused. \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s weird. Hey, let me do that,\u0026rdquo; she finished as she rose from her bed and crossed the room.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, weird,\u0026rdquo; Ann confirmed as she handed her sister the brush and turned to face the window, looking out over the beautiful Stanford campus. She relaxed for a few minutes as she let her sister groom her.\n\u0026ldquo;The mermaids do this all the time,\u0026rdquo; Ann said, enjoying tug of the brush against her hair.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but they do lots of other things too,\u0026rdquo; Kate said, looking at her sister\u0026rsquo;s long, vibrant hair as it flowed through her fingers.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I know,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And,\u0026rdquo; Kate said, barely breathing.\n\u0026ldquo;And I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Ann said lightly. \u0026ldquo;I think I\u0026rsquo;m cool with that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Cool with what?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked, dropping the brush to her own lap.\n\u0026ldquo;With you being my sister-wife,\u0026rdquo; Ann said, turning to face her sister in the bed.\nThey sat across from one another, cross-legged, their knees touching. They searched each other\u0026rsquo;s faces to see all the swirling emotions that glimmered in their eyes, tugged at their smiles, and encumbered their breathing.\n\u0026ldquo;Serious?\u0026rdquo; Kate said, her breath rising in her chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Totally,\u0026rdquo; Ann reassured her as she leaned forward and parted her lips, hesitation a few millimeters from her sister\u0026rsquo;s mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;Me too,\u0026rdquo; Kate whispered as she moved her lips across the small space that separated them, and gently pressed her lips to her sister\u0026rsquo;s.\nThey held their lips gently together, moving them slightly as they slowly deepened their kiss. Although they had kissed one another countless times in the past, this was their first kiss since they were twelve in which their sexuality was being tested. Ann moved her left arm up to Kate\u0026rsquo;s face as Kate moved her left arm as well. They each cradled one another\u0026rsquo;s soft face as they began to move their lips together, kissing again and again. After a few moments, they both leaned back and smiled at one another, their eyes shinning with love and affection, the smell of their shared arousal wafting upward.\n\u0026ldquo;That was way better than when we were younger,\u0026rdquo; Ann said, her face flushed.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Kate agreed. \u0026ldquo;It makes me feel stronger.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Stronger?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It felt right, you know?\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;Like we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be kissing, and supposed to become mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;Yea, I see that too. Can you imagine what Elena would say if she saw us kissing?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t remind me,\u0026rdquo; Kate said, her mood darkening.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked.\n\u0026ldquo;These walls are thin, and there is the smallest chance my roommate could come back,\u0026rdquo; Kate said sadly.\n\u0026ldquo;Elena is still fighting with her boyfriend?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked, familiar with the trials and tribulations of her sister\u0026rsquo;s roommate.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Kate agreed. \u0026ldquo;Tonight is supposed to be a make up, but she might come back. Even though she knows that you\u0026rsquo;re here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I guess we can\u0026rsquo;t sleep in the same bed without anyone freaking,\u0026rdquo; Ann said.\n\u0026ldquo;We could do that, and no one would care,\u0026rdquo; Kate said, puller her sister up and leading her back to her own bed. \u0026ldquo;But cuddling only. Elena can be a real bitch sometimes, and I\u0026rsquo;d rather she didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything to hold over me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Too bad,\u0026rdquo; Ann sighed. \u0026ldquo;I have been thinking about you a lot lately, when I \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Me too,\u0026rdquo; Kate admitted, knowing exactly what her sister was talking about. \u0026ldquo;God, I wish Elena would just fuck him and get it over with, then you and I could really spend tonight together.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Ann agreed wistfully. They sat for a moment, relaxed in one another\u0026rsquo;s presence. \u0026ldquo;Why is it that we are still technically virgins?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked impulsively.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha,\u0026rdquo; Kate said ruefully. \u0026ldquo;Sometimes, when I hear Elena screaming while I\u0026rsquo;m trying to study out in the suite, I wonder if we made the right decision about waiting. She always sounds like she\u0026rsquo;s having a great time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad we waited,\u0026rdquo; Ann argued. \u0026ldquo;Think how wonderful it will be when Trevor finally makes love to us! We both can lose our virginity to him, and neither one of us will be jealous. I wonder what he looks like as a merman?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I bet he is even better looking than he was,\u0026rdquo; Kate said, her breathing indicating her growing arousal. \u0026ldquo;God! Do you care if I masturbate?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about your other suite mates?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked, as she snuggled down next to her sister. \u0026ldquo;Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t they hear us? You\u0026rsquo;re real loud,\u0026rdquo; she giggled, remembering the many times they had masturbated together.\n\u0026ldquo;Who, me?\u0026rdquo; Kate protested. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re way louder than I am! Besides, my suite mates would only get made if they could hear us over their own screams,\u0026rdquo; Kate said giggling. \u0026ldquo;They have sex with someone almost every night, and it\u0026rsquo;s not with just boys.\u0026rdquo;\nBoth girls giggled, softly at first, and then louder.\n\u0026ldquo;Shuuuusch,\u0026rdquo; Ann warned. \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t want to wake your roommates up! They might want to join in,\u0026rdquo; she said, choking back her laughter.\n\u0026ldquo;O.K., O.K.,\u0026rdquo; Kate giggled. \u0026ldquo;We both scream too loud,\u0026rdquo; she whispered. \u0026ldquo;So, we wait until we\u0026rsquo;re mermaids?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We wait until we\u0026rsquo;re with Trevor and Rose,\u0026rdquo; Ann said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;It still takes a day or two to actually become a mermaid, you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I know,\u0026rdquo; Kate said, imitating the way her sister always said that phrase. \u0026ldquo;So, our Thanksgiving break is coming up, and we have to get Mom to help us change Dad\u0026rsquo;s mind.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, we do,\u0026rdquo; Ann agreed. \u0026ldquo;The sooner, the better.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are there any volunteers?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, as she looked around the Moon Pool. All the mermaids except for Danni, Xing, and the children had left the nursery cave and gathered in here. All of the mermaids were flushed with the after-effects of their recent sexual romp in the Nursery Cave, their eyes shinning and their tails still pulsing faintly with the lights of their recent passion. Pat, Phoebe, Emma, Galina, and Alexis had convinced the other mermaids to attempt some experiments in the presence of their sensors so that their mer-connections could be measured. They had measured their bioelectrical signals at rest, then while having sex, and now Pat wanted two mermaids from different pods to have sex so that those signals could be measured.\n\u0026ldquo;I know it goes against the mer-bonds we have developed,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued carefully. \u0026ldquo;But surely one of us finds someone else here attractive enough to cause that person to orgasm?\u0026rdquo;\nThere was silence as each of the sister-wives in the pool thought about what it would cost them to violate the deep bonds they could feel that they shared with their own pod-mates. Even those who could imagine breaking that bond had trouble imagining who they ought to pick to violate that bond with, even if it was in the name of science.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll go,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said softly. \u0026ldquo;I have a debt to pay to my uncle.\u0026rdquo;\nSeveral of the newer mermaids looked up with puzzled looks.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my niece,\u0026rdquo; Petra sighed. \u0026ldquo;You owe me nothing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Besides you have to man your station,\u0026rdquo; Pat warned.\n\u0026ldquo;My station is easy,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe argued. \u0026ldquo;In fact, only my station is easy, yours, Alexis', Galina\u0026rsquo;s, and Emma\u0026rsquo;s are in Cyrillic, and all I have to do is make sure the energy converter doesn\u0026rsquo;t overheat. Anyone can do it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s true,\u0026rdquo; Galina agreed. \u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;re related, aren\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That may be a factor, which is all the more reason for Petra and I to be one pair,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;I would be with Trixi,\u0026rdquo; Esmée said haltingly. \u0026ldquo;If she would have me. She did me many kindnesses back \u0026hellip; back \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t speak of it,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said quickly. \u0026ldquo;We do not speak of that past.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There would be no objection,\u0026rdquo; Shen said, putting a hand on her sisterwife' s shoulder. \u0026ldquo;We know of your love for us, and we know you will return.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Homa?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I am much healed,\u0026rdquo; Homa said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;If Esmée can offer, and you can accept, we can accept.\u0026rdquo; Binah nodded her agreement.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that seems to solve the problems of matched and mismatched pairs,\u0026rdquo; Pat observed. \u0026ldquo;Do you want some privacy, except for the sensors, of course?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; all four mermaids shouted at once.\n\u0026ldquo;I \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; mean,\u0026rdquo; Trixi stuttered. \u0026ldquo;I want my sister-wives here, with me. It will make it safer, easier.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mer-bonds are most impressive,\u0026rdquo; Galina observed, ever the scientist.\n\u0026ldquo;They are,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed, reaching out to Phoebe and squeezing her hand. \u0026ldquo;I love you, and we all love Petra. This is for science, after all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wonder how many guys would love to have THAT for a pick up line,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, breaking the tension as all the mermaids laughed.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you want me to send for Danni?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I\u0026rsquo;ll be fine,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe sighed. \u0026ldquo;It will actually be easier knowing that she is taking care of both Cynthia and Michelle, right Petra?\u0026rdquo;\nPetra nodded, thinking of both of their daughters playing with Danni. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it will be just you and I for our pods. Our sister wives will all be in other caves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will be here for all of you,\u0026rdquo; Sandi said.\n\u0026ldquo;All of us,\u0026rdquo; Dawn added. \u0026ldquo;This is for science, really. I want to understand why we feel the way that we do about each other.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, um, what do we do?\u0026rdquo; Esmée asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait until we get back to the lab and start the sub-routines,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;We will whistle when you should begin.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will need everyone but Phoebe, Petra, Trixi, and Esmée along the outer edge of the pool,\u0026rdquo; Galina said. \u0026ldquo;Just like we did when we were recording everyone\u0026rsquo;s individual signals. Sally, you\u0026rsquo;ve had plenty of experience with technical equipment, can you take Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s place?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; she said, giving a quick peck on the cheek to Liga. \u0026ldquo;If that\u0026rsquo;s alright with you?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\nLiga nodded and smiled, looking back and forth between Alexis and Sally. \u0026ldquo;I will be fine. I can help here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good. Everyone set?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\nEveryone nodded, and five mermaids headed down the tunnel that led to the lab cave, four mermaids moved to the center of the Moon Pool, illuminated by the late afternoon sun that trickled down from above, and the twelve remaining mermaids arranged themselves around the edges of the pool.\nMae looked to her right and smiled at Ragi, whose dark brown eyes glistened with worry. Just beyond her was her other sister-wife, Timi, who looked nearly as worried as Ragi. Mae tried to project as much love and reassurance as she could as she smiled at her sister wives. She knew that the former Polynesian men/turned mermaids were very insecure about their status, and that they depended upon their American sisterwife to explain many of the things that the other \u0026ldquo;Euro-American mermaids\u0026rdquo; said and did. Science was a particular area of insecurity, and Mae often found herself trying to explain concepts and ideas that were completely new to her naïve sister wives.\nRagi straightened her chin, knowing what Mae was thinking, and tried to put her best face forward. Inside, her guts were gripped with fear. How could anyone break the mer-bonds, she worried. If someone tried to take Mae or Timi away from her, she would go crazy, she feared. Her heart swelled with love and affection for the larger, blonde and blueeyed mermaid who looked so very different from herself and her fellow Polynesian sister-wife. Mae\u0026rsquo;s yellow and blue tail still pulsed with the echo\u0026rsquo;s of their shared passion, and that made Ragi feel stronger. She turned her attention to the four mermaids in the center and tried to understand, again, what sensors were, and how they worked.\nPhoebe and Petra slowly pushed themselves towards one another with their pelvic and mid-tail fins, their bodies slowly swaying in the water as they sashayed back and forth. Phoebe could feel the tug of her merbonds loosen as she sensed Pat rise up from the water into the air of the lab cave. She could still feel the strong connection to Danni and their three children, who must still be in the water of the Nursery cave. There was also the faintest, but clear connection to John, who was on the other side of the island, probably in the lagoon, she imagined based on the strength of the signal. She knew that the other mermen were with him, but she could not sense any of them. She could sense all the other mermaids in the room, however, and she catalogued all these feelings and sensations for later discussion.\nShe heard Sally\u0026rsquo;s whistle echo down the tunnel, indicating that they could start at any time, and she turned her full attention to Petra, her former uncle. Despite the strength of her mer-bonds, she was nevertheless moved by the beauty and sensuality of the beautiful mermaid she saw floating before her. Petra was one of the tallest mermaids, nearly three meters in length. Her long brown hair flowed like rich molasses down her shoulders and along her sides. Her wide set eyes, a piercing green, sparkled above her wide and generous smile. Her strong shoulders supported the largest breasts of any of the mermaids, matched only by Galina, who had modeled her own transformation on Petra. Beautifully buoyant in the water, Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts gently swayed and bobbed in the water as she drew closer to her niece, her large, dark nipples stiff and straight in the afternoon sunlight. Her waist tapered down dramatically and then flared out to generous hips, now decorated with dark lavender scales that sparkled in the golden light.\nThey weren\u0026rsquo;t really scales, Phoebe reminded herself; it was simply the illusion of scales created by the greatly changed texture and coloration of the skin that now covered their tails. Phoebe reached down and brushed the curving line of her own sea-blue tail as it rose along her hip bones and then dipped down under her belly only to rise up on the other hip. She marveled again at how soft their mermaid-nano-structured skin actually felt. Petra\u0026rsquo;s beautiful tail, nearly two meters long, shimmered with the beginnings of luminescence, light green flickers of light that sparkled throughout her dark lavender and black tail, dancing along the edges of her dark green fins and fringes that fluttered at the ends of her flukes and down along her dorsal ridge. Phoebe felt her own bioluminescence quicken within her and knew that her own light blue tail was now shimmering with pale white light, a color that matched her own nearly white blonde hair. Mer-bonding or not, Petra was a voluptuous and beautiful creature with whom anyone might fall hopelessly in love.\nFor her own part, Petra had always felt more generous with her sexual affections than many of her fellow mermaids. She had never actually seduced any other mermaid—there was no need when your own pod mates were nearly always equally horny and equally available. But this was special; it was for science. And the Nordic queen that floated before her was as beautiful and desirable as either Galina or Xing, though she loved them both. Petra drank in the look of lust she saw reflected in Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s shimmering, icy-blue eyes, and while not as rewarding as the love she saw in her sister-wives, it was a powerful and satisfying look nevertheless.\nWordlessly they reached out for one another, forgetting Trixi and Esmée who similarly moved together a few feet from them. Phoebe gasped as she felt Petra\u0026rsquo;s stiff nipple press into her own, and then she lost herself in Petra\u0026rsquo;s generous lips as they moved over her open mouth and drove her tongue in between her teeth. Petra moved her body slightly, causing the most delightful friction to erupt all along their bodies: their warm bellies pushing against each other\u0026rsquo;s, their breasts sliding through and around one another\u0026rsquo;s, their tails caressing the other\u0026rsquo;s. Phoebe wrapped her arms around Petra and pulled against her small waist, crushing their chests together. She stuck her own tongue into Petra\u0026rsquo;s mouth and dueled back and forth for sovereignty over that tender territory.\nFor many minutes, they kissed and nibbled at each other\u0026rsquo;s mouths, rubbing their long, sinuous bodies together, clutching at one another\u0026rsquo;s waist, hips, arms, shoulders, and pelvic fins. As their passion built, Phoebe was aware of John, Danni, and their three children\u0026rsquo;s bond to her, the faint connections still pulsing with energy, but she lost all sense of the other mermaids around her. Petra\u0026rsquo;s bioelectrical signals were overwhelming, washing over her mer-senses even as her passion built to a near crescendo. Too soon, thought Phoebe, too soon!\nShe pulled back from the kiss, and twisted herself away from Petra\u0026rsquo;s surprised grip, but she kept her body in contact with Petra\u0026rsquo;s as she started to rub herself against her former uncle. She pushed her sensitive gills against Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts, causing the latter to moan with appreciation. She twisted over Petra\u0026rsquo;s shoulders, snaking her way over and around her body, keeping as much contact as possible. Phoebe pressed her own breasts into Petra\u0026rsquo;s gills, and glided down over her hips and down along her dorsal ridge, trailing her own flukes over Petra\u0026rsquo;s face and shoulders. She tickled the fringes along the ends of Petra\u0026rsquo;s quivering flukes, sparking with luminescence, and then rose up along Petra\u0026rsquo;s front with her face nuzzling and caressing the length of her tail. As Phoebe passed Petra\u0026rsquo;s engorged vent, she kissed, nibbled, and licked her labia and clitoris as she passed by. She then traced a series of kisses up Petra\u0026rsquo;s belly, through the enormous valley of her breasts, up along her collarbone, along her graceful neck, and back to her luscious lips. She shared the lingering taste of Petra\u0026rsquo;s own juices with a deep, and passionate kiss.\nPetra arched a single eyebrow and then imitated her niece. She pushed her stiff nipples into the velvety softness of Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s gills, traced her dorsal ridge down to her flukes. Phoebe tried to give some of her senses over to the remaining mermaids in the Moon Pool, but she could not sense any of them, even Trixi and Esmee who were writhing together in a jumble of tails and torsos a mere meter from where she and Petra lavished their attentions on one another. Her own pod that was in the water, and Petra; that was it—no other signals came through. She gave up concentrating on science as Petra worked her way back up Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s front side, stopping for many minutes at her own vent, and then sharing with Phoebe the taste of her own sex. That kiss grew in intensity, until they were both grinding themselves against one another again.\nThey broke their kiss, grabbed one another\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fins, entwined their long tails around each other\u0026rsquo;s, and pressed their vents together, mashing their swollen vaginal lips against the others'. The both moved their hips in quick, small circles, pushing their clitorises across and over the other\u0026rsquo;s. Phoebe watched as Petra\u0026rsquo;s enormous breasts swelled even larger, and the first drops of milk appeared along the top and sides of her stiff, thumb-like nipples.\nPetra began moaning. Petra was more excited than she thought that she would be; her mer-bonds were still there, she could feel them, but making love to Phoebe was dangerous, exciting, and her body was responding. Phoebe could feel the shift in Petra\u0026rsquo;s energy, and her body responded as well. Her own breasts began to leak mermaid milk as she felt that delicious tightening in her womb that signaled her impending orgasm.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe moaned as she ground her hips into Petra\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, oh, oh,\u0026rdquo; Petra responded, her own breasts tingling with heaviness, swelling with milk.\nPhoebe watched as Petra\u0026rsquo;s breasts began to sprout streams of milk: first one, than two, than three, than five, six, ten! Petra was moaning constantly, her body building sexual tension as her orgasm approached. Phoebe quickened her pace and sharpened the circles she made with her hips, thrusting into Petra. As the water filled with Petra\u0026rsquo;s milk, Phoebe felt her own orgasm hurtle towards her, but she held it back, determined to wait for Petra to go first. Both mermaids fought a losing battle with their on coming orgasms, their bodies locked together, their abdomens tight and twitching as they pushed themselves into one another. Suddenly, Petra froze, except for her still spouting breasts, which now poured milk from multiple streams from each nipple, filling the water with a white haze. Then she shuddered forward, collapsing onto Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s shoulder, groaning and convulsing with each wave of pressure that rolled out from her hips across her body. Phoebe let loose the tension she had gathered into her womb, and felt her breasts match Petra\u0026rsquo;s as she joined her former uncle in the wondrous throes of a female orgasm. Together, they shuddered and moaned for many minutes, until finally they were still.\nAfter a moment, Phoebe noticed that Trixi and Esmée were staring at them with looks that could only be described as admiration, apparently having already finished a few moments before them. The other mermaids around the room share similar looks as they drifted towards the center of the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said happily. \u0026ldquo;That ought to give them something to measure.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mermaids?\u0026rdquo; Michael Thomson asked again, his eyes scanning the horizon before he turned around to face his two passengers lounging on the deck of his personal yacht, a Benetti Super that he had dubbed \u0026ldquo;Johanna\u0026rdquo; in honor of his deceased wife. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re telling me that Manalo was controlled by mermaids? And you expect me to believe you?!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Michael,\u0026rdquo; Joy said soothingly, \u0026ldquo;when have I ever lied to you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s always a first time,\u0026rdquo; he said warily. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s just say that I believe you, just for a moment. What other capabilities do these creatures have, besides paralyzing Manalo, breathing underwater, and living for a very long time?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Creatures?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked, sitting forward in his chair. \u0026ldquo;You remember that you are talking about my daughter, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Relax, Mac,\u0026rdquo; Joy admonished, \u0026ldquo;He didn\u0026rsquo;t mean anything by that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Michael said with a boyish grin, looking twenty years younger than his real age of sixty. \u0026ldquo;Mean anything, I mean. But I do keep forgetting that your daughter is someone who has changed. That makes your story harder to ignore.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tell me about it,\u0026rdquo; Mac grumped as he relaxed back into his seat, looking out over the bustle of Hong Kong harbor.\n\u0026ldquo;There are too many capabilities to list,\u0026rdquo; Joy answered, \u0026ldquo;but to answer your first question, Shen Chin was able to keep Manalo under control with mermaid venom, which a mermaid actually provided. They can paralyze their victims, if necessary, and if they drag you underwater after you have been paralyzed, you will drown. Diluted, it can keep a person immobile but alive and alert indefinitely. There were no mermaids on that boat, although everyone you met that day has now become a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Except for Tuo\u0026rsquo;s brother, Wong,\u0026rdquo; Mac added. \u0026ldquo;He became a merman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of brothers, Manalo\u0026rsquo;s brother visited me this morning,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;A smaller and nastier version, I\u0026rsquo;m afraid, but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t worry me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You need not worry about Manalo, now either,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s now a female dolphin.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Michael protested. \u0026ldquo;These mermaids can change people into animals; Manalo is a female dolphin? I just can\u0026rsquo;t believe it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You should come see for yourself,\u0026rdquo; Joy offered. \u0026ldquo;But you should be careful, you could \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;What, me become a merman?\u0026rdquo; Michael scoffed.\n\u0026ldquo;No, you could become a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Mac said with a grin as Joy punched him in the shoulder, scowling.\n\u0026ldquo;Mac, you\u0026rsquo;re not helping,\u0026rdquo; Joy said with mock sternness. \u0026ldquo;You could become a mermaid or a merman if you wanted, but we\u0026rsquo;ve learned just today that the \u0026ldquo;Moon Pool,\u0026rdquo; which is mermaid ground zero, affects any one or any thing that enters its waters. The mers' so-called \u0026ldquo;siren cell\u0026rdquo; not only changed them but also changed the bacteria and other microorganisms native to those caves. The Moon Pool is now itself a change agent; a person doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to drink mermaid milk to be affected. We\u0026rsquo;re just not sure how much any one can be affected.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve been in the Moon Pool?\u0026rdquo; Michael asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Joy answered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been several times, and Mac was there just a few days ago. We thought that we felt so great because we finally became lovers, but we now know that Mac and I have been getting slightly younger over the last few days, and we may have to get back to the island very soon because we\u0026rsquo;ve been exposed to its effects, and they aren\u0026rsquo;t sure how it will affect us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean that you might start changing into mermaids?\u0026rdquo; Michael asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, laughing at his look of surprise. \u0026ldquo;The mer-scientists theorize that we will follow a similar progression as did the original pair that landed on the island, except that we are already a heterosexual pair.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What progression is that?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked warily.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought you were paying attention,\u0026rdquo; Joy teased.\n\u0026ldquo;I was, but I\u0026rsquo;m asking for Michael\u0026rsquo;s benefit,\u0026rdquo; Mac shot back.\n\u0026ldquo;The original pair were two men,\u0026rdquo; Joy explained. \u0026ldquo;Over time, they both got younger and the smaller one turned female. Gills developed after a period of several months, and secondary marine characteristics, like webbed feet and hands, took several more months.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So you have a few months?\u0026rdquo; Michael asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe,\u0026rdquo; Joy answered. \u0026ldquo;We didn\u0026rsquo;t actually drink or use any of the original goop or mermaid milk, and the mers believe that we may have weeks, months, or even years, but if we start to see gill development along our backs, we are heading back right then.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mermaids,\u0026rdquo; Michael mused. \u0026ldquo;No kidding, straight up mermaids? What happens when they dry out?\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing special,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;They can get too dry, and they start to dehydrate, but these are not magical creatures, they are biological sea mammals.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You know something about mermaids?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, not really,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, thinking. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t work in the yachting industry and not learn a thing or two about why people love the water. You\u0026rsquo;d be surprised how many boat owners have some sort of thing for mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just boat owners?\u0026rdquo; Mac challenged. \u0026ldquo;My daughter Sally and her mate Eric had been dreaming of mermaids since they were kids, separately of course, but just the same. I bet there are a lot of people out there who might jump at the chance to become a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or a merman,\u0026rdquo; Michael corrected. \u0026ldquo;Yes, I know several people who I could recruit, if what you are saying is all true.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s all true, Michael,\u0026rdquo; Joy insisted. \u0026ldquo;I swear.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, what do you want from me,\u0026rdquo; Michael asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, Michael, the list is long,\u0026rdquo; Joy said with a shy smile. \u0026ldquo;But this time, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be as dangerous as some of my other requests.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s a relief,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\nHank Connor loved his wife. He also knew his wife, and he knew that was losing this argument. He could not, however, stop himself from continuing.\n\u0026ldquo;I just want them to have some sort of normal life before they make such a big change,\u0026rdquo; he repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Normal?\u0026rdquo; Janice challenged, her dark eyes flashing. \u0026ldquo;Their brother is now a mermaid who speaks four languages. The mers have several Ph.D.\u0026rsquo;s among them, and mer-learning is a hundred times more effective than Stanford could ever hope to achieve. What is so good about normal?\u0026rdquo;\nJanice began to pace, her small slim body circling the kitchen table in their San Francisco home. \u0026ldquo;The best education they could receive, in terms of sheer learning, would be to become mers and take advantage of Pat\u0026rsquo;s, Galina\u0026rsquo;s, Alexis', and the other\u0026rsquo;s educations. Besides, do you think they will become more obedient over the next three and a half years or less, especially if we transition and they do not?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I \u0026hellip; I,\u0026rdquo; Hank stammered.\n\u0026ldquo;How are we going to keep them in college and on track from the middle of the South Pacific, or are you giving up our own plans to return next summer?\u0026rdquo; she continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe they don\u0026rsquo;t want to return?\u0026rdquo; Hank protested feebly.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we do,\u0026rdquo; the girls shouted as they burst into the room, revealing that they had been listening for some time.\n\u0026ldquo;Dad,\u0026rdquo; Kate protested. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t be serious! We\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to go back since forever!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously,\u0026rdquo; Ann added. \u0026ldquo;Do you even pay attention? School is boring, and the last thing we want to do is go back. Besides, our roommates are stuck up bitches.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We think was should have Christmas in the tropics,\u0026rdquo; Kat said hopefully.\n\u0026ldquo;You do?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked. \u0026ldquo;And who will become your podmates?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Rose and Trevor,\u0026rdquo; they said in unison.\n\u0026ldquo;Your brother?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked, incredulous.\n\u0026ldquo;Our sister,\u0026rdquo; Kate said with a giggle.\n\u0026ldquo;But you would become lovers,\u0026rdquo; Hank continued. \u0026ldquo;Not just sisters. I cannot approve of such an arrangement.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Emma, Rikki, and Cleo have a wonderful pod,\u0026rdquo; Ann protested, as she took her sister\u0026rsquo;s hand in her own. \u0026ldquo;And Kate and I have been talking about this a lot, and we think it will work out just fine. Besides, who are you going to add to your pod with Mom?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s none of your business,\u0026rdquo; he argued.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course its their business,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;No matter what happens, we will still be a family. Nothing will ever change that. Rose is still our child, even if she isn\u0026rsquo;t our son any longer. Girls are less hung up about these sorts of things than guys are; too bad you\u0026rsquo;re not more like us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not fair,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, a blush rising from his neck. \u0026ldquo;I know how close you are with Julie, but Brian is about as likely to agree to become a mermaid as I am!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aunt Julie and Uncle Brian are coming with us?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not going anywhere,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, his anger rising.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, they are,\u0026rdquo; Janice said evenly, her face calm. \u0026ldquo;Now, I know that you\u0026rsquo;re upset that I told my sister about the mers, but that has nothing to do with your objections to their coming with us. We can work out something with Julie and Brian, I\u0026rsquo;m sure. Besides, we will never know if Brian is willing to become a mermaid unless we ask him.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When did you plan on doing that?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked, calming himself as he felt his wife\u0026rsquo;s strength of spirit wash over the room.\n\u0026ldquo;As soon as you decide when we are going back,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, sitting at the kitchen table.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it won\u0026rsquo;t be anytime soon,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;It can\u0026rsquo;t be until after the end of the school year, which is why they should go back to college.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We could go tomorrow or we could go next year,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;But the longer we wait, the less likely Rose and Trevor will be able to wait for Kate and Ann. I know that the girls have their heart set on Trevor, and I think it would be selfish of us to let our own troubles with deciding on our pod deprive them of their happiness. It\u0026rsquo;s not like we are considering NOT going back to the island; Trevor and Rose want to wait, but what if they have to rescue someone, like Eric and Sally did with Alexis and Liga. What do you think will happen? Will they wait for Kate and Ann to return, or rescue the person in need?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Trevor is an honorable man,\u0026rdquo; Hank said with a defeated sigh. \u0026ldquo;He would do the right thing to help out someone in need.\u0026rdquo; He turned to his two daughters and looked at them sternly. \u0026ldquo;Do you girls really want to be with Rose and Trevor? This is not a decision that you can do over; once we go, that\u0026rsquo;s how it will be for the next six or seven hundred years.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Daddy,\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s practically the dumbest question ever.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is there anyone else you\u0026rsquo;d like to see us with?\u0026rdquo; challenged Ann. \u0026ldquo;Did you have someone else in mind?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, nothing like that,\u0026rdquo; Hank reassured them, his heart nearly breaking as he saw the deep wells of emotion in each of their eyes. His little girls were grown up, though just barely, and although he knew that they had long held a crush on Trevor, he always imagined that only one of his girls would become Trevor\u0026rsquo;s wife.\n\u0026ldquo;Honey,\u0026rdquo; Janice said soothingly. \u0026ldquo;There is a certain justice in this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t have to watch Trevor be forced to choose which of our two girls he really loves,\u0026rdquo; she said smiling at her daughters. \u0026ldquo;He can have all three, and there will be no one left behind.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Never thought of it that way,\u0026rdquo; he said feebly.\n\u0026ldquo;So, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing preventing us from leaving tomorrow,\u0026rdquo; Janice said brightly. \u0026ldquo;Besides, the environmental work that we could be doing won\u0026rsquo;t get any easier the longer we wait.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we can\u0026rsquo;t just \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Hank protested.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, but we can,\u0026rdquo; Janice interrupted. \u0026ldquo;All it will take is one signature, and the foundation you set up will go into effect. We could leave anytime.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, please, Daddy, PLUUUUEEEEAAAASEEEEE,\u0026rdquo; both girls squealed.\n\u0026ldquo;I want to go through those papers a few more times,\u0026rdquo; Hank protested. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be caught with my pants down a few years from now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Daddy,\u0026rdquo; Kate giggled. \u0026ldquo;You won\u0026rsquo;t be able to wear pants a few years from now.\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish Basra breathed deeply, calming himself before he knocked on the door. Malaki Dimaunahan, his boss, had killed seven people in the last two days: three in the very office into which he was about to walk with what Sudhish assumed would be bad news. He thought again, for perhaps the hundredth time that day, what his older sister, Geeta, was already suffering at the hands of Malaki\u0026rsquo;s organization, and what his younger sisters might suffer if he lost his temper or slipped-up in any way. He could condemn them to a life of prostitution or worse, and he felt the bile and shame rise in his throat again as he knocked on the rich, mahogany door.\n\u0026ldquo;Come in,\u0026rdquo; was the oddly dispassionate invitation from the other side of the door.\nSudhish strode into the room confidently and placed the printed email on Malaki\u0026rsquo;s desk. The older man turned from the windows that offered a magnificent view of the surrounding city from the 78th floor of the Petronas Towers, and picked up the email. He scanned it quickly.\n\u0026ldquo;Send for Torro,\u0026rdquo; Malaki ordered without looking up from the email. \u0026ldquo;I will kill Alberto Estanado with my own bare hands if I have to,\u0026rdquo; he continued in a soft voice. \u0026ldquo;I will find him and kill him if it costs me every son I have fathered. Did Abao send any other communication?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, sir,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish answered. \u0026ldquo;That email was the only word. No phone calls, no satellite link, nothing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you make of this?\u0026rdquo; Malaki asked, waving the email in front of his secretary.\n\u0026ldquo;Me, sir?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I think Abao thinks he can impress you by finding Manalo and his kidnappers, killing Alberto, and returning with your money,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think he will succeed?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, sir.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why not?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, sir,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said, shifting his weight between his two feet. \u0026ldquo;Tumibay went in with an experienced team, with plenty of firepower, and the element of surprise. His yacht was destroyed and all his men have disappeared. That\u0026rsquo;s impressive, even for Mr. Estanado. Manalo followed, your own son, and Alberto was able to convince him to either join with him, made him an accomplice, or threatened him into cooperating, although I cannot imagine what Alberto could possibly hold over your son.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps it was Miss Chin that held something?\u0026rdquo; Malaki asked. \u0026ldquo;Miss Chin, her sister, and several girls from the Davao brothel disappeared, they strangely show up in Hong Kong, and now all of them, including my son, are missing. How can Mr. Estanado be responsible for all this?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I do not know,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish answered. \u0026ldquo;I only know that three separate attempts have been made on Alberto\u0026rsquo;s hideaway, and none have yet succeeded. Abao is going in with only a few men, his personal bodyguards, none of whom are experienced in maritime operations or combat. They are simply thugs. Whether they meet Alberto\u0026rsquo;s gang or Miss Chin, I do not think it will matter. There are too many unanswered questions, and Abao has made a foolish mistake. He has not even told us which one of the hundreds of tiny islands that he will be attacking, in case he gets into trouble.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;On that final point, I agree with you,\u0026rdquo; Malaki sighed. \u0026ldquo;My second son is a fool. You may go.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish answered as he turned to leave.\n\u0026ldquo;One more thing,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said in the same casual tone that marked nearly everything he uttered.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir?\u0026rdquo; Sudhish asked, turning again.\n\u0026ldquo;If you persist in trying to locate your sister, I will kill her,\u0026rdquo; he said lightly. \u0026ldquo;Then, I will take your other sisters. Do you understand?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish answered, his face burning with anger and shame.\nRose and Trevor had spent several days exploring the surrounding area to the south of their island. They found countless shipwrecks, airplanes, and strange formations of rock and choral. Now they were exploring a large, luxury yacht that must have sunk in a recent storm, as there was no damage to the hull or deck and there was only a dusting of barnacles on the various parts of the boat. No sign of the passengers could be found, despite a wide sweep of the area.\nIn one of the staterooms Rose found a set of paintbrushes and a large collection of oil paints. None of the sketchpads were usable\u0026ndash;the paper disintegrated as she touched it\u0026ndash;but the brushes and tubes of paint were still intact. She could hear Trevor going through one of the other rooms, muttering to himself. She decided to try to paint something on the wall of the room, even though she knew that the oil would probably not cure underwater. But it had been so long since she exercised her artist self that she was determined to at least try.\nAs she wondered if she should just collect the paint in her net/bag and wait until they were back in the caves to paint more or less normally, she reviewed her own education as an artist. She smiled to herself as she pictured her old self, Robbie, talking to her new self, Rose. How much had changed since his college days, and although he had never dreamed of becoming a girl, being a mermaid was better than she thought possible. She felt her heart ache as she thought of her sisters, whom she knew to be desperately wishing to be with her and Trevor. At least she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about her sisters fighting over Trevor\u0026rsquo;s attention; all of them could share equally once they became mers. She shook herself from her reverie, and thought again about the paint that lay before her in the dim light of the stateroom. How would she ever get paint to dry underwater?\nWait, she thought to herself, an oil based painting underwater was theoretically possible because oil paint didn\u0026rsquo;t dry via evaporation, it oxidized, a chemical reaction equivalent to combustion. She nodded to herself, remembering her \u0026ldquo;art foundations class.\u0026rdquo; The oxidized oil set off other chemical reactions that caused the oil to polymerize\u0026ndash;to form long chain-like molecules that cross-link to one another, stabilizing the film of paint. Over time, those polymer bonds ionize, which creates a permanent bond between both the paints and the surface to which it has been applied. Since there was oxygen in water, it was possible that she could get the paint to oxidize.\nAlright, she thought to herself, now she was getting somewhere. Pat had said something about their mer organs and ionization, but she couldn\u0026rsquo;t remember what. Well, \u0026ldquo;he\u0026rdquo; had never been very good at science, but he had been very good at art. Perhaps \u0026ldquo;she\u0026rdquo; could be a scientist and an artist. Perhaps \u0026ldquo;she\u0026rdquo; could get the paint to stick to the wall of the stateroom after all. She would need to free up the oxygen in the water so that it could bond with the oil paint. She looked at the metal brush in her hand and remembered that underwater plasma techniques in metal cutting used high intensity electrical discharges to convert water into steam, which also frees up hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals. She didn\u0026rsquo;t want to cut metal, and didn\u0026rsquo;t think the mers' electrical organs could generate that much power anyway. She only wanted a tiny reaction, microscopic, and only at the end of her paint brush.\nThat was it! She could use the wrong end of the brush as the focal point for very quick and very small pulses of electricity that would cause the paint to oxidize as she pressed it into the wall of the cabin. The mers had refrained from trying to use their mer-organs in this way for fear of releasing too much energy, but Rose pushed those worries aside. She wanted to paint, and come hell or high water, she was going to paint. She only wanted to generate the smallest of reactions \u0026hellip; OMG, she practically said out loud to herself, the micro-bubbles they saw during mer-transition in the Moon Pool were exactly the tiny reactions she wanted. That level of energy production must be natural to the mers, maybe they were incapable of a really big shock, despite what Pat and the others had said.\nShe squeezed out a tiny bit of red paint and tried to get it to flow onto the tip of the handle, but the paint was less dense than the heavy, salty water around it and slowly rose up away from the brush. She dropped the metal tube and cupped the globule of paint in her hand, stopping its rise, and then brought the the slender point and poked it into the center of the blob of paint. It stuck to the top of the handle, and she carefully moved her hand away.\nShe focused her mind on creating an ionizing force from her mer organs that flowed up her dorsal ridge, through her arm, and out to the tip of the paintbrushes' pointed end as she moved the long, thin, metal handle towards the wall of the stateroom and began to trace her first work of art as a mermaid. She noticed a growing pressure rising from her tail, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t painful, and so she ignored it as she worked. She noticed that a trail of microscopic bubbles, barely visible to the naked eye (even to a mermaid\u0026rsquo;s enhanced naked eye), rose from the end of her brush as she pushed the paint onto the wall. It seemed to be working! She didn\u0026rsquo;t know how she was doing it, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t care. She was creating incredibly tiny pulses of energy that exploded from the end of her paintbrush, and vaporized a tiny group of water molecules. Satisfied that she could actually paint, she added some of her mental focus back into being an artist. Soon, a quick sketch of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s tail began to take shape on the wall. She opened a tube of black paint and added that second color to her sketch, working quickly, forcing the paint onto the wall with the hard tip of the paintbrush\u0026rsquo;s handle. She could feel herself go \u0026ldquo;into the zone\u0026rdquo; that characterized her work as an artist when she was still a human (and a boy). Her mind felt amazingly alive as she effortlessly pushed paint onto the wall in bold strokes, every cell of her being focused on her task.\nTrevor heard tapping and scrapping coming from another part of the wreck, and he warily moved through the boat towards the sound. Was Rose making these noises or was she in a different area of the wreck? As he got closer, he noticed that something seemed to be off with Rose\u0026rsquo;s bioelectrical signal. It was behaving in a way he had never noticed or felt. He pushed himself more quickly down the narrow hallway of the sunken boat and passed through the open door where he sensed Rose was and was struck by a strange sight. Rose was painting. She worked quickly, taking paint from a series of small tubes and pushing them onto the wall with the wrong end of a paintbrush. Small air bubbles wobbled along the ceiling of the stateroom, seeking a way out towards the surface. The small room was perceptively warmer, but only a tiny bit. Whatever Rose was doing, she was generating heat. He started to say something, but he could tell that she was \u0026ldquo;in the zone,\u0026rdquo; and so he just watched her work. He noticed that her beautiful red tail was pulsing with light, but they were neither the same lights that signified sex nor the lights that signified their mer-organs defense against pressure. The patterns rose from her scarlet flukes to the tip of her black, velvety-fringed, dorsal ridge, which was barely visible behind her floating, black hair.\nRose had no sense of time as she worked, she didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that she was actually warming up the room, and she didn\u0026rsquo;t even sense that Trevor had joined her. After nearly an hour of work, the painting was done. Trevor\u0026rsquo;s dramatic red and black striped tail curled up behind him, his gold fringed flukes spread out behind his head, dramatically offsetting his long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. His arms were crossed on his chest, and his slim hips and firm abdomen glistened in the oil paints on the wall. She floated for a moment, looking at the portrait of her lover that she had just created. Then she added her initials to his left hip and closed her eyes, leaving the tip in the freshly applied paint, focusing on her hope that it would stick to the wall. Her tail pulsed strongly, and a fine web of tiny filaments of light played across the painting, flickering and pulsing across the surface of the work. After a minute or two, the she felt the slight pressure in her tail subside, and she lifted her brush to look at her finished work.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s amazing,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said, startling her.\n\u0026ldquo;Holy Shit!\u0026rdquo; she shouted. \u0026ldquo;You scared me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said as he pushed himself into the room. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to disturb the artist at work.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, regaining her composure.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s really good,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said drifting towards the painting.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t touch it,\u0026rdquo; Rose cautioned. \u0026ldquo;It takes weeks for the oil to solidify in the air, and I\u0026rsquo;m not certain it will ever firm up here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It looks dry to me,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said, backing his hand away from the wall.\n\u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t be,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, moving closer to the wall.\n\u0026ldquo;Why not?\u0026rdquo; Trevor said.\n\u0026ldquo;Oil doesn\u0026rsquo;t dry, it oxidizes,\u0026rdquo; she said, reaching out with one finger to touch the paint on the wall. She gasped. The paint was solid. \u0026ldquo;Or ionizes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Huh?\u0026rdquo; asked Trevor, confused.\n\u0026ldquo;Never mind,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, excitedly. \u0026ldquo;We have to get back to the island right away!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about the painting?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not going anywhere,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, grabbing his hand and pulling him out through the door. \u0026ldquo;We can come back for it later.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s so important?\u0026rdquo; complained Trevor.\n\u0026ldquo;Mermaids can polymerize,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, grinning.\n\u0026ldquo;Huh?\u0026rdquo;\nTwo men looked over the thousands of cargo containers stacked on the deck of the Marfret Provance, a large container ship. They stood on the top of a tall stack of containers that loomed high above the churning sea below. Each man was linked to a safety wire that ran the length of the ship, but if the wind caught them now, they would be dragged in the water for several minutes before their crewmates would be able to reel them back aboard, so the both moved slowly over the rolling boxes.\n\u0026ldquo;The Captain is crazy,\u0026rdquo; the shorter one complained as the wind lashed at them. \u0026ldquo;We are going to get killed on this damn box boat.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are getting five thousand extra to dump these two over the side and to keep our mouths shut,\u0026rdquo; the taller one shouted back. \u0026ldquo;Get your cable ready and wait for the signal.\u0026rdquo;\nThe two men crawled towards the ends of the large green container that lay atop the aft-most stack of containers on the port side. The containers were covered with Chinese characters indicating that they came from Hong Kong, and had the blessings of the Ministry of Science. The two men, however, could not read Chinese. They each looked down at the cables and twist locks that secured one box to the next, and so on, each one linked to the others and then to the ship itself. They clambered down the sides of the stack while the wind and spray lashed at them, snapping their safety lines as they snaked down the side of the stack. When they reached the second container down from the top, each man unlinked the cables and clamps that held the top two boxes to the rest of stack. Then they scrambled back up to the top of the stack, moving to the top of the box adjacent to the ones they had just unlimbered as quickly as they could. Then they each picked up a long pry bar and inserted it into the space between the outside box and the interior one upon which they stood. They looked out at the grey sea for a moment, watching the wind and rain saw across the horizon, the dark sea below them churning, and then each waved one arm in the direction of the bridge.\nThe ship began to slowly turn, pushing the bow of the ship away from the headwind into which it had been headed. As the bow plunged down between the wave troughs rather than through them, the ship began to rock from side to side, gaining momentum with each set of waves that swelled beneath the ship. The two men rocked with the majestic swings of the giant ship, the agonizingly slow cycle of the waves as the ship rolled back and forth along its keel. They watched each other, nodding their heads as they counted the seconds between each cycle. As the ship rolled towards port a final time, they both nodded and pulled back on the levers with all their strength. The two top containers quietly and quickly rolled off the ship and plunged into the sea below.\n\u0026ldquo;Why are we dumping these boxes in the middle of no where?\u0026rdquo; the complaining crewmember shouted as he worked his way back towards his crewmate, while the ship began its slow torturous turn back into the wind.\n\u0026ldquo;Five thousand extra,\u0026rdquo; his taller crewmate answered as they watched the containers recede into the distance, bobbing heavily along the surface of the waves.\n\u0026ldquo;I wonder what is inside those boxes?\u0026rdquo; Shorty asked, as he peered over the side of the ship, ignoring his partner\u0026rsquo;s actions.\n\u0026ldquo;For five thousand, we don\u0026rsquo;t ask any questions,\u0026rdquo; the other said as he turned towards his partner\u0026rsquo;s safety line and cut it.\n\u0026ldquo;I am just curious,\u0026rdquo; Shorty argued, turning to face his partner, his back to the sea. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with knowing what we just dumped into the ocean?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps you will get to find out,\u0026rdquo; the tall one said as he gently pushed one hand into the complaining crewmember\u0026rsquo;s chest, causing him to fall off the boat and into the sea. He watched for a moment as the shorter man struggled in the sea, and when he could not see the man\u0026rsquo;s head bobbing in the waves, he said \u0026ldquo;Good for nothing college drop out.\u0026rdquo;\nThe tall man began working his way back to the bridge, leaning into the increasing headwind as the ship continued to turn back into the wind, putting even more distance between the boat and the boxes and castaway still bobbing in the dark sea. \u0026ldquo;Thinks he\u0026rsquo;s better than everyone else, eh?\u0026rdquo; the tall man muttered into the wind, smiling. \u0026ldquo;Now, it\u0026rsquo;s ten thousand for me, and someone for the captain to blame for the missing boxes.\u0026rdquo;\nHank Connor held his pen poised above the stack of papers for a moment, his face grave and still. His wife of 29 years beside him, and across the table sat one of his oldest and most trusted friends, Bartholomew Kolbert, his former college roommate and now, a partner at the prestigious law firm of Pillsbury, Winthrop, Shaw, and Pittman. Outside the large plate glass window, a San Francisco street car clanged and rattled as it went by and the street below, breaking the silence.\n\u0026ldquo;Hank?\u0026rdquo; Janice prompted.\n\u0026ldquo;One signature, eh?\u0026rdquo; he said ironically, looking at the tall stack of papers that awaited his signature.\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t say how many times you had to sign, only that it was your signature alone that was necessary,\u0026rdquo; she countered with a gentle smile.\nHe shot his wife a quick smile in return, sighed, and signed his name at the bottom of the sheet of paper.\n\u0026ldquo;Now this one, next,\u0026rdquo; his long-time lawyer and family friend, Bartholomew (call me Bart) Kolbert said as he pushed the next stack towards his old friend.\n\u0026ldquo;How many of these are there?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked testily, as he affixed his name to another set of documents.\n\u0026ldquo;You wrote half of them yourself,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;This work is all airtight, really good, especially for someone who isn\u0026rsquo;t a lawyer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Starting up your own dot com teaches you a lot about the law,\u0026rdquo; Hank said as he watched Bart\u0026rsquo;s secretary notarize his signatures.\n\u0026ldquo;So, the girls aren\u0026rsquo;t returning to college?\u0026rdquo; Bart asked. \u0026ldquo;You all are going to go off to this island you bought and start to build some sort of research facility?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They are both interested in marine biology,\u0026rdquo; Janice answered quickly. \u0026ldquo;Since this new Marine Mammal Institute will eventually attract scholars and scientists from all over the world, we believe that both Kate and Ann will have more of a \u0026ldquo;hands-on\u0026rdquo; education in the sciences.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Better than Stanford or UCLA?\u0026rdquo; Bart asked, as he pushed another stack towards Hank.\n\u0026ldquo;We already have scientists on staff who graduated from MIT, Evergreen State University, St. Petersburg State Marine Technical University, and the Russian Academy of Sciences,\u0026rdquo; explained Hank as he continued to sign document after document, handing them to the notary.\n\u0026ldquo;You have staff already?\u0026rdquo; asked Bart. \u0026ldquo;You barely have title to the island.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought we had title to five islands,\u0026rdquo; Hank said with annoyance.\n\u0026ldquo;You do,\u0026rdquo; Bart reassured him. \u0026ldquo;I just thought you might spend more time before you put anyone on staff. We don\u0026rsquo;t even have all the visas cleared for the financial transactions we\u0026rsquo;ve already undertaken. I have no idea how we will pay anyone, let alone staff you\u0026rsquo;ve already hired.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, don\u0026rsquo;t worry,\u0026rdquo; Hank said with a mysterious smile. \u0026ldquo;These people have been working on the island for several years. The MMI will only facilitate and expand work that has already been started.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, I see,\u0026rdquo; Bart said as he pushed yet another stack at Hank. \u0026ldquo;Someday you are going to have to explain Appendix T to me. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have anything to do with something vaguely illegal that you want Greenpeace to pursue, does it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Hank said laughing. \u0026ldquo;Nothing with Greenpeace, I assure you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously?\u0026rdquo; Janice giggled. \u0026ldquo;Appendix T?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a private joke, Bart,\u0026rdquo; Hank started, turning away from his wife as he was handed yet another stack of papers to sign. \u0026ldquo;You will receive a message from me to unseal one of my personal safety deposit boxes, and there will be more instructions there. The code words in Appendix T will make more sense then. Greenpeace is not going to be part of the MMI, at least not initially. That\u0026rsquo;s the best I can do for now, but trust me, the mere fact that you are the only name on that document is a testament to how much I trust you. I cannot yet tell you more. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you can remain mysterious a while longer,\u0026rdquo; Bart said, pushing yet another stack of papers in front of Hank. \u0026ldquo;I had always thought you\u0026rsquo;d retire to an island somewhere, but I thought it would be later rather than sooner.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll understand some day,\u0026rdquo; Hank assured him as he signed yet another stack of documents. \u0026ldquo;I promise; you can come for a visit, and then you\u0026rsquo;ll understand everything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to come for a visit,\u0026rdquo; Bart protested. \u0026ldquo;I just want to know where you are. You know how much I hate the water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Bart,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, resting her hand on his arm. \u0026ldquo;We know, and that\u0026rsquo;s why we know that you are the only one that we can truly trust to remain behind, run our financial accounts, and not let anyone try to steal the trusts or foundations from us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Besides, once we get all the equipment set up and running, we can visit via satellite hook up,\u0026rdquo; Hank said laughing. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll never need to even get your feet wet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How much more vacation time do you have left?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked as she turned under her blanket to face Mac in the first class sleeper pod they shared on the Airbus A380.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s see now,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, ticking off the days on his fingers. \u0026ldquo;Three days to get to Mermaid Island, four days there, then two days up to Hong Kong, a week there, and now one day flying to Kuala Lampur. I have two more weeks of vacation, six weeks of unused sick leave, and two weeks of unused personal leave. Why?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So to be safe, you should resign your commission in another four weeks,\u0026rdquo; Joy said thoughtfully. \u0026ldquo;Which means we only have a few days here before we head off to Washington, D.C.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why the rush?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re changing quickly enough so that Michael\u0026rsquo;s secretary asked you if you had dyed your hair,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Your hair darkened enough in eight days that a stranger noticed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m on vacation,\u0026rdquo; Mac protested. \u0026ldquo;Who will notice someone\u0026rsquo;s hair changing color? Hell, people\u0026rsquo;s hair changes color on vacation all the time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Joy agreed. \u0026ldquo;It gets lighter, by the sun, not darker because you\u0026rsquo;re getting younger. At this rate of change, we will be unrecognizable as ourselves in a few months. Because it\u0026rsquo;s still hard to judge, we need to accomplish what we can as quickly as possible. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to expose the secret of the mers sooner than we have planned.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As usual, you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Mac agreed, sighing.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Two things,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, as he stretched out his legs. \u0026ldquo;One, I wanted a shot at Joint Chief\u0026rsquo;s of Staff before I retired, and two, when we get back to Mermaid Island, Mark will technically have seniority on me as far as mer-time goes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we\u0026rsquo;ll just have to make sure that we recruit two other senior officers for our pod,\u0026rdquo; Joy teased. \u0026ldquo;That way our pod will out-rank his.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of out rank, do you think Dr. Su and Michael will be able to get those supplies sent to the island?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Taiping is one of my oldest contacts and a dear friend,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Besides, after he gave the Ministry of Science that anemone that eats pollution, he will get anything he asks for with no questions asked. Michael has been getting things done for me for years, things that only a rich and well connected man can do for a lady like me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A lady like you is expensive,\u0026rdquo; Mac said teasingly.\n\u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m worth it,\u0026rdquo; Joy said as she leaned across their small, private bed, and kissed him soundly.\n\u0026ldquo;How will Taiping keep the location and the purpose secret?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\nJoy shot him a look of complete shock.\n\u0026ldquo;What? I\u0026rsquo;m curious if the Chinese do it differently than we do,\u0026rdquo; he protested.\n\u0026ldquo;As long as we keep sending him scientific breakthroughs, we will be fine,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;He is very well placed, and his superiors know better, and leave him alone. Taiping will be fine, barring a radical shake-up among the higher ups. Besides, Pat and the others are working on the ultimate defense, and once Taiping explains why it would be in China\u0026rsquo;s best interest to keep his secret contact a secret, we will not have to worry about China at least.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Mac sighed. \u0026ldquo;We will only have the United States, Russia, India, the European Union, and any crackpot nation to worry about.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will take care of the US and Europe,\u0026rdquo; Joy said confidently. \u0026ldquo;India will follow western policy, Galina is pretty sure Russia will follow the US, and that leaves only crackpot nations. Hopefully, you\u0026rsquo;ll have trained up the mer-navy enough so we won\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about them so much.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I still get to be an admiral, eh?\u0026rdquo; Mac joked. \u0026ldquo;Have you thought of who we should recruit to be in our pod?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got a few ideas,\u0026rdquo; Joy said with a mysterious smile.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll bet you do,\u0026rdquo; Mac grumped, knowing that look. \u0026ldquo;Well, there is no one that I either need enough or trust enough to recruit to be a member of my pod. I\u0026rsquo;ll grant that you got lucky with Mark. He was a great choice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, he was,\u0026rdquo; Joy agreed. \u0026ldquo;I have some feelers out, but I\u0026rsquo;ll make sure that you get the final say. After all, the four of us will have to live together for a very long time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we will,\u0026rdquo; Mac agreed, kissing her.\n\u0026ldquo;What if one of them is a man?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;There is only going to be one merman in my pod,\u0026rdquo; Mac said gruffly. \u0026ldquo;Me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But how would you feel making him into a mermaid?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked as she leaned into him and kissed his ear.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;I never thought about it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, think about it,\u0026rdquo; Joy urged as she nuzzled his ear.\n\u0026ldquo;I think I will feel the same way you feel,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, lifting his head to allow her greater access to his neck.\n\u0026ldquo;And how do you think I feel about that?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, nibbling at his ear lobe.\n\u0026ldquo;I think it turns you on,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, reaching around her shoulders and drawing her into his chest.\n\u0026ldquo;You think that helping you turn an old friend into a mermaid turns me on?\u0026rdquo; Joy breathed into his neck as her other hand reached for Mac\u0026rsquo;s crotch.\n\u0026ldquo;It turns me on,\u0026rdquo; Mac gasped as Joy tugged at his now hard cock.\n\u0026ldquo;How would you do it?\u0026rdquo; she asked as she began to stroke him through his pants.\n\u0026ldquo;Do what?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked as he fumbled under her skirt, seeking her crotch with his urgent fingers.\n\u0026ldquo;Force someone to become a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, gasping as Mac\u0026rsquo;s fingers found her swollen and wet bud. She pushed her own hand down Mac\u0026rsquo;s pants and started to pull on his stiff cock.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would force someone,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem right.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course,\u0026rdquo; Joy agreed. \u0026ldquo;But we\u0026rsquo;re just playing right now, this is just fantasy. Tell me \u0026hellip; how?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, just fantasy eh?\u0026rdquo; Mac smiled, warming to his task as Joy worked on his cock. \u0026ldquo;First, he would willingly feed from your breasts, sucking the life changing milk from your own body,\u0026rdquo; Mac said as Joy\u0026rsquo;s body began to stiffen as his fingers twirled around her clitoris. \u0026ldquo;He would believe that he would be the merman, but then you would jerk my cock, just like you\u0026rsquo;re doing now, right into his face.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What if he fought us?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, her hips beginning to twitch.\n\u0026ldquo;We would time him up, or the other girl would help us hold him, hold his mouth open,\u0026rdquo; Mac moaned. \u0026ldquo;And I would \u0026hellip; would \u0026hellip; ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u0026rdquo; he muttered as he erupted into Joy\u0026rsquo;s hand.\n\u0026ldquo;Yesssssssssss,\u0026rdquo; Joy agreed as her own orgasm swept through her body.\nDanni looked down into the sparkling blue eyes of her daughter as Freya tugged at her breast, feeding. Freya\u0026rsquo;s golden blonde hair already cascaded over her shoulders even though she was only a little over three weeks old. She looks like a perfect China Doll, Danni thought, with her smooth pale skin, big blue eyes, curly blonde hair, and \u0026hellip; well \u0026hellip; a perfect Mermaid China Doll, with her pale blue tail fringed with golden highlights along her fins and flukes that matched her blond hair. The golden fringe along the trailing edge of her flukes tickled Danni\u0026rsquo;s lap as she held her daughter in the soft glow of the afternoon sun as it filtered through the chimney of the Moon Pool.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Freya,\u0026rdquo; Danni cooed, \u0026ldquo;You are so beautiful, a perfect little mermaid. I love you so much.\u0026rdquo;\nFreya\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened with emotion, almost as if she understood her mother, and then she doubled her efforts to pull the life-sustaining milk from her mother\u0026rsquo;s large, heavy breasts. Her tiny fists pushed at the sides and underside of Danni\u0026rsquo;s breast as her small mouth engulfed the large nipple that dripped with milk.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think they can understand us?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked her sister wives, who sat on either side of her, also feeding their daughters.\n\u0026ldquo;What does your CHEW tell you?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\nDanni closed her eyes and focused on the special connection that all mers could feel amongst one another. The one that connected her to her daughter pulsed stronger than the ones that wove her pod together, and Freya\u0026rsquo;s CHEW pulsed with love, hunger, and happiness.\n\u0026ldquo;She knows that I love her,\u0026rdquo; Danni said. \u0026ldquo;And she\u0026rsquo;s still hungry. Her CHEW is pulsing with happiness.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, wait a minute here,\u0026rdquo; John interrupted, pausing in his task of moving a tub of smoked fish within reach of the feeding mothers. \u0026ldquo;What the heck is a chew?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, sorry love,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with a grin. \u0026ldquo;While you boys were out trying to figure out how to fight off the bad guys, the girls made a major scientific discovery.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really, I thought you all just had a major orgy,\u0026rdquo; John teased.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re just jealous because you weren\u0026rsquo;t there,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe teased back, shifting Cynthia to her other breast as her daughter fed ravenously.\n\u0026ldquo;You never know when insight will strike,\u0026rdquo; Pat rejoined. \u0026ldquo;Newton had to wait for the apple to bonk him on the head before he understood something that was right under his nose.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, you had an orgy, and got bonked on the head. What is a chew?\u0026rdquo; John repeated, salamandering behind his wives, curling his flukes around Phoebe, rubbing his mid-tail fins against Danni\u0026rsquo;s back, and draping his arm around Pat\u0026rsquo;s shoulders so that he could stroke Maureen\u0026rsquo;s head as she feed from her mother.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it took us a couple of days after the orgy to figure it out,\u0026rdquo; Pat admitted. \u0026ldquo;But we think we have it nailed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What is nailed?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;C.H.E.W.,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained, \u0026ldquo;stands for Christoffel, Higgs, Einstein Wave.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;O.K.,\u0026rdquo; John said slowly. \u0026ldquo;Einstein I got \u0026hellip; the rest is gibberish.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Elwin Bruno Christoffel was a German mathematician and Physicist,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe explained. \u0026ldquo;He discovered the Levi-Civita connection in \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, can we just cut to the chase?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s just been studying,\u0026rdquo; Pat said smiling at her sister-wife. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s worked very hard on all the books that Joy sent us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mark and Wong\u0026rsquo;s pods are back already?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, not the drop that happened yesterday,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;The one from last month. Jeesh, even I can\u0026rsquo;t read that fast.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right. CHEW?\u0026rdquo; John repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Chrsitoffel theorized parallel transports of packets within curved space,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe explained. \u0026ldquo;Peter Higgs discovered a new particle associated with superconductivity and String Theory, and Einstein was the inspiration for Pat and Alexis when they first identified a plausible theory for our mer-connections.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And it added a vowel so we could remember our acronym,\u0026rdquo; Danni teased.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to explain,\u0026rdquo; Pat advised. \u0026ldquo;But in a nutshell, we noticed that our mer-connections were some how intensified or amplified when we were all in the Nursery Cave last week. While we were all still in the throes of sex, we tried to \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; the connections the way that Eric says he can.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We weren\u0026rsquo;t successful,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, \u0026ldquo;but we had a lot of fun trying.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be you did,\u0026rdquo; John said smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;It didn\u0026rsquo;t matter where we were relative to one another; we were always able to feel or see the connections we had with our mates as long as we were all in the water,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued. \u0026ldquo;Even when we tried to deliberately scramble the signals, we could always tell where our podmates were and what their state of being was. We could sense everyone else if they were nearby, except during sex when the intensity of our disrupted CHEW overwhelmed everything else, but our own pods were still clear, special, despite any attempt to scramble the connection.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How did you try to scramble the signals?\u0026rdquo; John teased. \u0026ldquo;Did you finally have your fling with your ex-uncle?\u0026rdquo; he asked Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; she answered, sticking her tongue at him. \u0026ldquo;After we moved back to the Moon Pool for testing. Too bad for you that you couldn\u0026rsquo;t watch.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got everything I\u0026rsquo;ll ever want, right here,\u0026rdquo; John answered, stroking her pelvic fin with his flukes.\n\u0026ldquo;Anyway, like Phoebe said, we decided to get serious about why our signals were stronger in the water than in the air and with our own pods and not other mers,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued. \u0026ldquo;So we moved back into the Moon Pool, and we were able to record everyone\u0026rsquo;s signals in the sensors we placed all around the pool. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s signals were equal, according to the sensors, even when pod-mates were having sex.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And we always feel more strongly connected during sex,\u0026rdquo; John nodded, following along. \u0026ldquo;So, either the sensors weren\u0026rsquo;t picking up the full signal or we are just imagining the varying strengths of our signals.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed, proud of how well John kept up with her explanations of science. \u0026ldquo;Alexis remembered that superconductive materials are often more dense than other materials that also conduct electromagnetic waves and that super-conducted waves are themselves subject to less distortion and signal loss.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Water is not superconductive, is it?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; said Phoebe. \u0026ldquo;We are, but only in water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We believe that our new mer-organs shape a small part of our own electromagnetic fields into a highly condensed, superconductive waveform that is as idiosyncratic as our DNA,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;When we emotionally and physically bind ourselves together during sex, we become attuned to one-another\u0026rsquo;s individual waveforms, allowing us to \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; the superconductive wave that was there all the time. But, once a signal has been \u0026ldquo;attuned,\u0026rdquo; then it finds us, like a magnet, rather than us being a radio receiver.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean, finds us?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;When the sun sends out light energy, it goes everywhere,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;The light doesn\u0026rsquo;t find your eyes; your eyes gather in the light and then your brain translates those signals into information from which it then constructs a picture of the world. If you were attuned to the sun\u0026rsquo;s light, you could be deep in a cave, and a tendril of light would still find you. The twists and turns of the cave would not prevent the suns rays from finding you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s freaky,\u0026rdquo; John mused.\n\u0026ldquo;Sort of,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;But it explains what we experience in terms of how we know ourselves to be connected to one another. All living things generate some level of electromagnetic activity. Most organisms only generate very tiny signals, and only a few species can sense, or see, those signals, like sharks. We can sense all bio-electromagnetic activities, but we sense our own pods in a way that is fundamentally different from all others. Something has to account for that difference.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;CHEW,\u0026rdquo; John repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;When we looked over the parts of Agba and Angara that we have preserved, we could see that the receptors in our mer-organs have a very unusual shape to them, sort of like a blanket that has been folded over on itself again and again. This shape, according to Galina, is very similar to some of the most recent models for our \u0026ldquo;superstring universe.\u0026rdquo; We didn\u0026rsquo;t see the importance of that observation until later, but those receptors then send signals to our brain, not unlike the signals that our brain receives from our eyes or our ears, and our brains turn that signal into information. Electromagnetic information, rather than sound or light. And, just like a light picture that can be burned into your memory from your eyes, something so vivid you\u0026rsquo;ll never forget it, the electromagnetic waveforms that each of us generate becomes literally burned into our brains.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why is it that only Eric can see these waveforms?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;He doesn\u0026rsquo;t see the waveform itself any better than you do,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;When you look at a sunset, you see the same colors, the same ocean, the same sky: you both see the waveform, the picture. But Eric can see some of the light rays too, without the benefit of the clouds forcing some light shafts to appear brighter than others. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t see all the light rays; he only sees the strong, superconductive signals, the ones we generate. Other animals only look like lights, just like when you look the sun. We think that his receptors must be larger or somehow different from the rest of ours, and when we get the equipment Joy is sending us, we will try to find out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think I understand,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;So, I can \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; each of you, the totality of your signal, your waveform. But I can\u0026rsquo;t see the actual condensed, superconductive wave that snakes through the air and joins us together. Only Eric can.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; answered Phoebe. \u0026ldquo;But we\u0026rsquo;re not sure the waveform actually travels through the air, or water, or even our normal three or four dimensional space. The parts of our receptors seem to be mimicking the mathematical models for superstring \u0026ldquo;multiverse.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s why the \u0026ldquo;Higgs\u0026rdquo; is in the acronym CHEW; the Higgs Field is what superstrings travel through, and that\u0026rsquo;s what we think Eric is actually seeing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, this is where I freak out, right?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Pat said reassuringly. \u0026ldquo;Phoebe is exaggerating a bit. Do you remember the particle colliders they are building all over the place?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;One in Huston and one in Geneva?\u0026rdquo; asked John.\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, there are hundreds of colliders all over the world,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;But the one in Geneva is the largest and is, or at least was, not yet finished when we landed on Mermaid Island. There, they will smash all kinds of particles together to break them down into smaller particles to discover the nature of the universe.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now who is exaggerating?\u0026rdquo; teased John.\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, switching her daughter to her other breast. \u0026ldquo;They are testing what scientists call \u0026ldquo;The Standard Model,\u0026rdquo; a theory that attempts to explain all physical phenomena in the Universe. Anyway, my point is that even those machines do not \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo; these particles pass through the Higgs Field, they only see the traces of those particles, like skid marks on a road.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, Eric can see the echo\u0026rsquo;s of our signals?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s close enough.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn digested this information for a bit as he watched his daughters feeding. He was reminded, again, of how lucky he was to have three such different and vibrant mermaids for his mates. Pat was steady and thoughtful, with her strong, silent leadership, so much against the stereotype of the fiery redhead she resembled. Danni was the consummate mother, always giving and loving her pod-mates and all three of their children, again, so much against the stereotype of the statuesque, blonde, sex-goddess that she resembled. Finally, Phoebe was the mischievous and brilliant, imaginative child, very much against her strangely odd, but compellingly beautiful, icy Nordic, white upon white complexion and coloring. Each of them were looking into the eyes of their daughters, each so beautiful but so different.\n\u0026ldquo;So, how does CHEW explain the emotional changes?\u0026rdquo; John asked. \u0026ldquo;All this talk is pretty technical, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to explain my feelings for all of you. No one who has been changed can remember feeling the same levels of \u0026hellip; well, emotional connectedness.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean love?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, turning to kiss her lover.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, love, then,\u0026rdquo; John agreed, sheepishly. \u0026ldquo;Why do we feel so in love, rather than just plain old connected, like an electrical circuit?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Have you ever held onto a live wire for very long,\u0026rdquo; Pat teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Why should I when I\u0026rsquo;ve got you three to keep me on my toes?\u0026rdquo; he shot back.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha. Don\u0026rsquo;t make the comparison until you\u0026rsquo;ve tried it,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Are we making another bet?\u0026rdquo; John asked.\n\u0026ldquo;What, that we\u0026rsquo;re more powerful than a live electrical wire?\u0026rdquo; asked Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;No, that I\u0026rsquo;m more powerful than that wire, my girl!\u0026rdquo; John said with a laugh.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;d like that bet,\u0026rdquo; Danni said.\n\u0026ldquo;No, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;John is better than a mere electrical connection, but we still haven\u0026rsquo;t discovered if our mer organs can actually shock anyone. What if he accidentally killed you, or you accidentally killed him? We are packing a lot of electrical energy in here,\u0026rdquo; she finished, slapping her tail with her free hand, causing Cynthia to pull away from her nipple. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, honey. I was just teasing your dad.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not as up on this as I should be,\u0026rdquo; Pat said slowly, \u0026ldquo;but lots of cognitive scientists have been using MRI\u0026rsquo;s to track changes to the brain caused by love.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously?\u0026rdquo; John asked. \u0026ldquo;They study love?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, smarty pants,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;They study how the brain changes in response to love. All animals form attachments of various kinds and types, and when they do, their brains and body chemistry changes. When humans fall in love, their brains are saturated with hormones and chemicals that cause them to behave differently, focus solely upon the object of their love, take risks, and all sorts of things. The brain basically burns pathways into the structure of your memory that cause you to feel love.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, love is just a chemical reaction?\u0026rdquo; John said wistfully. \u0026ldquo;I thought it was something more.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is sunlight on your face any less enjoyable because you understand what a photon is?\u0026rdquo; challenged Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it could be more enjoyable if I thought Ra was sending his love to me,\u0026rdquo; said John.\n\u0026ldquo;Or it could cause you great fear because you thought that the Sun God was going to die unless you kept a log burning all night during the winter solstice,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Just because we understand how something happens doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it less special. Sometimes, it makes it more special. We mers are miracles, a one in a billion shot chance, and as we discover more about ourselves and our capabilities, it won\u0026rsquo;t make me one iota less happy that I am a mermaid, your mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we bond differently,\u0026rdquo; John continued. \u0026ldquo;We mermen cannot be with another male and a lone mermaid without our brains being saturated with a whole different batch of hormones and chemicals that have nothing to do with love. So, is mermaid love is different than human love?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have a good point,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;I think the mechanics may be very similar, but CHEW raises the stakes, makes our bonds stronger, a part of our physical bodies, not just hormones in the brain. That\u0026rsquo;s why the death of a pod member causes such pain. The pain is literally physical, according to those few of us who have experienced it. Our mer-bonds are more than just an emotion, like love. They are actual things: waves of electromagnetic energy generated by our mer-organs that fuse us together.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think CHEW is a thing, it\u0026rsquo;s a force,\u0026rdquo; John said.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean a force?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, looking up sharply.\n\u0026ldquo;I mean a force like any other electromagnetic or atomic force,\u0026rdquo; John said carefully. \u0026ldquo;You know, something that makes things spin, glow, heat up, send signals over long distances, or makes bonds stronger.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The CHEW can be measured, and it\u0026rsquo;s very weak,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;We did it when we saw how the sensors in the Moon Pool recorded our signals when we entered the pool. The only reason it feels strong to us is because we are attuned to it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps,\u0026rdquo; said John. \u0026ldquo;But isn\u0026rsquo;t the so-called Weak Nuclear Force the one that not only holds the universe together but also what eventually led to the power of the atomic bomb? Aren\u0026rsquo;t we just very large particles that have been bound together by a very small force?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god, John!\u0026rdquo; Pat gushed. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a genius!\u0026rdquo;\nHarold Matthews debated stepping off the container box and letting himself sink into the ocean. He had been perched on the waterlogged box for the past two days, and he knew that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t last much longer. The storm had tossed him roughly for the first twenty-four hours, and when the sea calmed, he had some hope for rescue. But after a full day of sun, heat, and glare, his thirst was beginning to drive him mad. He lay on his back and watched as the sun slowly set on the horizon, the vast expanse of sea swallowing up the last of the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays. The stars were already beginning to be visible in the azure sky, and it was beautiful, despite his dire situation. No, he thought to himself, despite being a college drop out, Harold Matthews was not a quitter. He would not kill himself this evening, especially if there was any way to get his revenge upon his former shipmates.\nHe sat up suddenly. Had he heard voices? He couldn\u0026rsquo;t have. The sea was calm, empty, and growing darker. He searched for the other container, but it was hard to see in the growing darkness. During the storm, it had drifted about 100 meters away, and both containers were barely buoyant. Even now, as he sat atop his box, water ran up along the grooves in the corrugated metal and kept his clothes damp with seawater. There, he spotted it in the last glints of sunlight that shimmered across the water! And there WERE people in the water, several people in the water. He could see at least two men and many women.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey,\u0026rdquo; he shouted. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m over here.\u0026rdquo;\nOne of the men turned to look at him, and after a second, as if someone had given a silent signal, everyone ducked beneath the waves. He didn\u0026rsquo;t think he saw any scuba equipment on anyone\u0026rsquo;s back, and although they were quite a ways off, he thought he could see that the women were very beautiful. He scanned the water, waiting to see any of them come back up for a breath of air, but several moments passed, and no one reappeared. He stood up on shaky legs, trying to see the other container in the waning light, but he could see nothing.\nSuddenly, the box upon which he stood lurched to starboard, and he tumbled into the water. He felt a brief sting on his leg, and then a growing numbness spread up his body. He was horrified to discover that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t move, and he dared not to take a breath! He was under water. He felt hands push his body up to the surface, and sensed people around him. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t turn his head to look around, but he knew that many hands held him to the surface the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Is he breathing yet?\u0026rdquo; asked a male voice near his hips.\n\u0026ldquo;No, but he will have to in a minute,\u0026rdquo; a female voice said near his ear.\nHarold so desperately wanted to turn and look at the sensuous and sweet voice that was mere inches from his ear, but all he could do was look upward into the sky as it slowly filled with stars. Finally, his lungs felt like they were bursting, and his chest heaved a ragged breath into his body. Another, and a third, and then his breathing felt more normal, less labored, but he still could not move any other muscle in his body.\n\u0026ldquo;Wong,\u0026rdquo; a male voice near his feet said. \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you take your pod back to the sled and start hooking up the containers while we wait for our guest to recover enough for talking. Trixi, did Pat ever talk about how long the mermaid venom lasted?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He will be able to talk in twenty minutes,\u0026rdquo; the wonderful female voice by his ear spoke again. \u0026ldquo;But he will be incapable of any selflocomotion for five or six hours.\u0026rdquo;\nMermaid venom? What the hell were these people talking about? Harold thought for a moment that his thirst had actually driven him mad, and that he was hallucinating everything. But he could feel the hands that held him up, keeping his head above the gently rolling sea, saving his life, which he could still feel pulsing in his own heartbeat. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t move, but he could feel everything. This had to be real. God, he wished that he could move or talk. Mermaids!\n\u0026ldquo;Alright,\u0026rdquo; the male voice continued. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll need to find him some water; he looks pretty dehydrated. Is there any in the emergency pack on the sled?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think so,\u0026rdquo; another female voice answered, and Harold felt one pair of hands leave his waist and heard what sounded like the flip of a tailfin as it slapped the water. The remaining hands gave him a very thorough frisking.\n\u0026ldquo;Not armed,\u0026rdquo; the male voice confirmed.\n\u0026ldquo;We stung him for nothing,\u0026rdquo; a female voice said with surprising compassion.\n\u0026ldquo;Always better to be safe, than sorry,\u0026rdquo; the male voice said with equal emotion.\nA few moments passed, and the hands held him steady as the stars filled the quickly darkening sky. He could feel the hands of a woman on his head, another set of hands on his waist, and then a final set on his feet. He thought he could feel the woman\u0026rsquo;s naked breasts brush against the back of his head as she held his face above the level of the water. Humans would have been in wet suits, and he could feel the texture of the smooth skin of the woman who held his head. Perhaps there really were such things as mermaids. His reverie was broken when the forth creature returned from the sled with her burden.\n\u0026ldquo;Mark,\u0026rdquo; The female voice said, \u0026ldquo;float up under him so we can tilt his head up.\u0026rdquo;\nHarold felt the hands at his feet shift, and then he felt a body rise up beneath his, and then the pressure grew as the body beneath him became strongly buoyant, lifting his entire body nearly out of the water. He could feel wide and strong flukes curling upward to support his shoulders, and the feminine hands left his waist. The hands on his feet tightened, and then he felt his head rise from the surface of the sea as his body was angled down towards his feet. A glimmer of starlight bounced off the curly tresses of a blonde goddess that appeared before him, and she raised a canteen with Cyrillic writing on it to his lips.\n\u0026ldquo;Relax,\u0026rdquo; she reassured him, smiling and showing rows of perfectly white teeth. \u0026ldquo;We won\u0026rsquo;t hurt you, but we had to make sure that you couldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do you know he speaks English?\u0026rdquo; a voice behind him asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; the beauty before him said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just trying to be friendly.\u0026rdquo;\nShe pinched his lips, opening his mouth, and slowly dribbled water onto his tongue. He could feel some water slide down the back of his mouth, and he worried that he might choke on the water. The mermaid before him must have seen his eyes widen in fear, because she told him, \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, your automatic reflexes still work even though you\u0026rsquo;re paralyzed.\u0026rdquo; She was right, because without any effort or direction from his brain, he swallowed the water. After he had drunk a few gulps, he felt his thirst slacken.\n\u0026ldquo;We ready to go,\u0026rdquo; a new male voice with a slight Chinese accent reported. \u0026ldquo;What we going to do him?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mon dieu! It will only take a very few hours to get back to the caves,\u0026rdquo; a French accented, female voice answered. \u0026ldquo;We cannot leave him out here to die, and he will not slow us at all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, I mean, how are we going to do him?\u0026rdquo; the male voice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We can work in shifts,\u0026rdquo; another female voice added as the blonde beauty he could see dribbled some more water into his mouth. \u0026ldquo;The sled will do most of the work with the containers, and so keeping him alive and moving will actually be the harder task. Why don\u0026rsquo;t you guys take first shift on the sailor, and we\u0026rsquo;ll handle the sled?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fine,\u0026rdquo; the blonde agreed. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get going so we can get him back to the island before the venom wears off.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When did your friend say he was coming?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked, tugging at his shirt in the muggy mid-morning air.\n\u0026ldquo;He didn\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t look so annoyed. Conjo isn\u0026rsquo;t coming, an unexpected ally is. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to have one of my old contacts to know someone so well placed in Mr. Dimaunahan\u0026rsquo;s organization. It seems we may have hit pay dirt; it\u0026rsquo;s Malaki\u0026rsquo;s personal assistant that is coming, and he fears and despises Malaki.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good, that man is despicable,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;So, when is the assistant coming?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Soon,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;You were in the military. You should know the drill.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, kicking at the pavement. \u0026ldquo;Hurry up and wait. I hate waiting.\u0026rdquo;\nThey stood in Hisbiscus Garden in the Taman Tasik Perdana, one of the oldest parks in Malaysia. There was a three level fountain that cascaded down behind them, and the air was pungent with a rich variety of flowers. The hot air seemed less oppressive here, lighter and more fragrant.\n\u0026ldquo;There,\u0026rdquo; Joy nodded almost imperceptively in the direction of a small man of Indian descent who approached them cautiously. He glanced nervously around the small courtyard, purposefully not looking at Joy and Mac where they stood. After a few minutes of glancing at his watch, straightening his tie, and playing with his thick, curly hair, he finally made his way over to the two Americans.\n\u0026ldquo;The day will be hot,\u0026rdquo; the young man said nervously.\n\u0026ldquo;But not for the flowers,\u0026rdquo; Joy answered, smiling. \u0026ldquo;They enjoy the sunlight.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are Conjo\u0026rsquo;s friends?\u0026rdquo; the man asked with relief.\nThey both nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;I am Sudhish Basra,\u0026rdquo; he said, glancing around again. \u0026ldquo;Why did Conjo want me to meet you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right to the point,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I like that. We know that you are Malaki Dimaunahan\u0026rsquo;s personal assistant, and we know that your sisters Geeta, Rani, and Vidya are being held by him in three different brothel\u0026rsquo;s across Asia.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?!\u0026rdquo; Sudhish exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;He has taken them all! How do you know? Why haven\u0026rsquo;t my parents told me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry you didn\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Joy said with compassion. \u0026ldquo;I should not have been the one to tell you.\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish turned away from the American\u0026rsquo;s, struggling to regain his composure. After a brief moment he turned back to face them.\n\u0026ldquo;What else do you know?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Too much to talk for much longer here,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Meet us at the Hotel Imperial. Ask for the Johnson party in the main dining room. We can talk over dinner.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why should I trust you?\u0026rdquo; Sudhish asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Because Malaki has tried to harm my daughter, and Alberto and Manalo are dead,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;We would like to see Malaki dead, a hope I believe we all share?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said, a small, slight smile cracking across his face. \u0026ldquo;It is a hope we both share.\u0026rdquo;\nPat turned the tiara over in her hands, stunned at the beauty of Rose\u0026rsquo;s handiwork. The luminescent headpiece was a beautiful mesh of filigreed silver strands that sparkled with flashes of yellow, green, blue, and red that appeared to be embedded within the metal. In the center of the tiara there was an intricate weave of tiny strands of metal that looped back and forth upon itself in a pattern that she recognized from their recent MRI\u0026rsquo;s of the mer-receptors in their tails.\n\u0026ldquo;You did this freeform, in the water?\u0026rdquo; she asked incredulously.\n\u0026ldquo;Eric helped me,\u0026rdquo; Rose said blushing. \u0026ldquo;He traced the patterns he could see that connected him with his girls, and I interpreted those in the filaments and I used the MRI pictures of our mer organs that you showed yesterday as a model for the centerpiece. The tiara is a ionized polymer of oil paint resins and dissolved heavy metals from the sea.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How did you know what to do?\u0026rdquo; Pat started.\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe helped me there,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, looking over at her other partner in crime. \u0026ldquo;When you, Galina, and Alexis got stuck with the problems in testing Eric and his pod in the MRI, she got bored and helped me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We didn\u0026rsquo;t get stuck,\u0026rdquo; Galina protested. \u0026ldquo;His readings were not unusual, and we just wanted to see if the phenomena of his vision was based in his girls.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re still working on that theory, but we\u0026rsquo;re not stuck yet,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;Phoebe, what did you do to \u0026lsquo;help\u0026rsquo; Rose?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I remembered there are large amounts of strong, heavy metals that are dissolved in seawater,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;I just described to her what kind of picture the atomic structures of those metals were, and she would start the ionic pulses in her tail, enticing the dissolved metals to polymerize on the end of her paintbrush. As the metals bonded with the paint, the sculpture just grew in the water in front of her. It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not sure what metals are actually in the tiara,\u0026rdquo; Rose explained. \u0026ldquo;Because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t really see or feel any of the metals individually, I just could sense that there was something in the water that was attracted to my ionizing waves, and I focused on those feelings of attraction.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We think that the colors in the metal come from trace pigments in the paint and all the salts and other chemicals that exist naturally in seawater,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe continued. \u0026ldquo;We think that the final carbon-metal polymer chain has a mix of several metals like nickel, uranium, vanadium, cobalt, and titanium.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think I could have forced a purer polymerization,\u0026rdquo; Rose added. \u0026ldquo;But I thought the colors were beautiful. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really think it would be anything other than beautiful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And these things are otherwise inert?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, turning to Alexis, who held a matching tiara in her own hands.\n\u0026ldquo;We ran them through every sensor we have,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Nothing, not even radioactivity, though they are highly conductive, nearly superconductive, you might say. They are incredible material; stronger than anything I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen, and yet lighter than I would have thought possible. Excellent elasticity too,\u0026rdquo; she noted as she twisted the tiara into a tight spiral and then let it spring back into its original shape.\n\u0026ldquo;And they intensify our CHEW?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked. \u0026ldquo;That is just beyond unbelievable.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Try it,\u0026rdquo; Alexis offered, as she put the tiara on her head.\nPat glanced around the Moon Pool, noting the expectant looks of everyone. She looked at Alexis, who seemed to be suffering no ill effects from wearing the tiara. A final look at Danni who held Maureen by the fist while Freya hung on her pelvic fin, and she put on the tiara. For a second, she didn\u0026rsquo;t notice any difference, but then she felt a tingling in her tail rise up, move through her body, and ended with a buzzing sensation in her scalp. She watched amazed, as the delicate tendrils of light that danced through the Moon Pool came into focus, playing across the mers and the edges of the pool like an enormous Van de Graaff generator. It was beautiful!\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s like prescription glasses for our mer senses,\u0026rdquo; she gushed.\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly,\u0026rdquo; Rose beamed.\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s more,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. (How about this?)\n\u0026ldquo;What just happened?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, stunned. \u0026ldquo;How did you talk without talking?\u0026rdquo;\n(We are sending electromagnetic energy to one another, which can carry any information, like sound or perhaps the shape of sound if we were actually generating sound,) Alexis sent to her via her CHEW. (I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how it works, but it works, as you can see.)\n(Like this?) Pat thought back at Alexis.\n(Yes,) she replied. (We think that we are sending the signals that our inner ears normally send to our brain, which is an electromagnetic wave, after all, embedded within our CHEW\u0026rsquo;s. When our brains get those same signals that it normally translates from sound waves into words, we understand speech.)\n\u0026ldquo;Rose,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said out loud. \u0026ldquo;Can you please distribute the rest of them?\u0026rdquo;\nRose nodded to Trevor who distributed tiara\u0026rsquo;s to all the mermaids and slender headbands to all the men.\n\u0026ldquo;I wanted there to be some distinction between the mermen and the mermaids,\u0026rdquo; Rose explained. \u0026ldquo;So I made the men\u0026rsquo;s tiaras a bit more like headbands. The pattern of the metal still works as an amplifier for our CHEW\u0026rsquo;s, but I thought it looked more masculine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think they look great,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said as he snugged the solid, silver band back through his hair and nestled the front\u0026rsquo;s piece onto his forehead. (And they work great too.)\n(Can we all communicate in this way?) Pat asked the collective group as they all donned their headpieces. A collection of affirmations confirmed her supposition.\n(Do we have enough for Mark and Wong\u0026rsquo;s pods when they get back?) Pat asked.\n(Yes,) Rose answered. (I made enough for five more pods. They don\u0026rsquo;t take too long to make, but the seawater gets tired after a while.)\n(What do you mean, tired?) asked Pat.\n(There is probably only so much dissolved metal in any given patch of the sea, and it takes time for currents and natural molecular distribution to replenish the supply,) Phoebe said.\n(I just know that it gets harder to make the metals bind to the paint after an hour or so,) Rose added.\n(Do you get tired doing this?) Pat asked.\n(Not really,) Rose answered. (Not any more so than any other activity we\u0026rsquo;ve done.)\n(Who do those go to?) Pat asked, indicating the two additional tiara\u0026rsquo;s Trevor held in his hand.\n(My sisters,) Rose answered. (I made mine, Kate\u0026rsquo;s and Ann\u0026rsquo;s at the same time,) she explained as she reached for the tiara\u0026rsquo;s. (I put these Celtic knots along the temple nodes for ours, in honor of our Irish heritage.)\n(Everyone else\u0026rsquo;s are identical?) Pat asked.\n(As much as free-hand, 3-D polymer-ionic construction allows,) Rose answered. (The odd thing is how easy it is to get the mer-receptor patterns the same\u0026ndash;they just seem to flow from my paintbrush, whereas I had a hard time with the Celtic knots.)\n(Let\u0026rsquo;s file that fact away for later. What physical or mental costs are there for all of us doing this?) Pat asked. (And, how do our brains generate the \u0026ldquo;sound signal\u0026rdquo; that our inner ears normally hear? Our vocal boxes are not connected to our ears, after all.)\n(That\u0026rsquo;s what the rest of this afternoon is for,) Alexis said. (We are going to test the range and limits of Rose\u0026rsquo;s devices and try to theorize why we can talk without talking.)\n(Well, Rose,) Phoebe teased. (I guess we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to count you as one of the scientists from now on.)\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish answered, as he toyed with his untouched dessert. \u0026ldquo;I can see the benefits of waiting, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to see my sisters suffer a moment longer than necessary. Surely you can see that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Sudhish,\u0026rdquo; Joy agreed. \u0026ldquo;But this is a cancer we want to end permanently, not just for us and your sisters, but upon all who have been subjected to Malaki\u0026rsquo;s cruelty.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We cannot speed things up further?\u0026rdquo; Sudhish pleaded. \u0026ldquo;Malaki has killed our parents, what keeps him from killing me or my sisters?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Both you and your sisters have enormous commercial value,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Malaki is first and foremost a businessman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Besides, we must let Abao make his run,\u0026rdquo; Mac advised. \u0026ldquo;If we tip our hand in any way, we will lose the prize we both want.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How can you be certain that your people will win?\u0026rdquo; Sudhish asked, playing with his fork as he worried about both his and his sisters' future.\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing is ever certain,\u0026rdquo; Joy agreed. \u0026ldquo;But we have already overcome Alberto, Tumibay, and Manalo, and everyone agrees that Abao is not the match of even his older brother. We are not worried.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, at least it\u0026rsquo;s good to know that I was right,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;About what?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;That it was something other than Alberto that had defeated the others,\u0026rdquo; he said with out rancor. \u0026ldquo;It was your friends. Why can they not now help me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We can help each other,\u0026rdquo; Joy suggested. \u0026ldquo;Meet us tomorrow and give us all the information on your sisters that you can, and see what you can find out about an older woman who might have been traded by Alberto before he went into hiding.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What was her name?\u0026rdquo; Sudhish asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Emma Henderson,\u0026rdquo; Joy answered. \u0026ldquo;Show Malaki this message from Manalo, and say that the currier from Michael Thompson thinks that she was the last deal Alberto made before he went into hiding, and that she may know something about where Alberto is and why he has been such trouble. Once you know where she is, suggest to have her moved to a port, any port, and we will take care of the rest,\u0026rdquo; she finished as she slid a worn piece of paper across the table.\nSudhish held a barely legible note written on the hotel stationary in which Manalo and Miss Chen had last stayed. It said: \u0026ldquo;Key \u0026hellip; Alberto \u0026hellip; Emma Henderson.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think this should convince him,\u0026rdquo; he nodded. \u0026ldquo;How will I contact you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tell Conjo that you need to get a message to Joy,\u0026rdquo; she said.\nEmma twisted her flukes counterclockwise and flutter-kicked hard twice, lifting her body out of the water, twisting around Tutu as she and the dolphin arced past each other. Emma thrilled to the weightlessness she felt as her twisting body reached the top of the arc, the warm sun glinting off her shimmering blue and white tail. The gray and white Tutu was spinning right next to her, and in a carefully timed move at the top of their arcs, Emma slapped Tutu\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fin with her own, their wet appendences smacking the air with a sharp retort. Both Emma and Tutu squealed with joy as they sliced back down into the crystal clear water, pulling a trail of bubbles through the lagoon\u0026rsquo;s warm waters. Emma angled her yellow elbow fins sharply, and her upper torso carved a sharp path over towards Tutu. Two hard kicks later, and she closed her fingers over Tutu\u0026rsquo;s dorsal fin, and synchronized her own flukes to the dolphin\u0026rsquo;s. Together they angled up for the surface again, and as they left the water, Emma angled her flukes back so that Tutu somersaulted forward while she did a back flip, both of them spinning in unison, and then splashing back into the water.\nEmma was momentarily blinded by her own, thick, rich dark brown hair as it swirled around her as she twisted back towards the shore where the rest of her pod watched her play with Tutu. She sensed Tutu off to her left, and she clicked and whistled \u0026ldquo;family\u0026rdquo; and headed for her pod, Tutu falling in beside her. Together they sped through the water, just below the surface, breaking the waves every few strokes to let Tutu breathe. Emma felt her eyelids tighten as her inner membrane rose to protect her eyes from the rushing water, and she marveled at the power she felt as her amazing body raced through the warm water. She loved the way her pelvic fins seemed to guide her wide hips through the water, accentuating her feminine outline as she pushed herself along. Her reverie was interrupted when they both heard MuMu\u0026rsquo;s squeal followed by the \u0026ldquo;danger\u0026rdquo; whistle, and together they both turned around towards the outer lagoon where the other dolphin had been feeding.\n(MuMu\u0026rsquo;s in trouble,) Emma sent towards her pod, but she could tell that they were out of the water, and therefore out of range of their CHEW channel. Damn, she thought to herself, and wished yet again that their superconductive signals could travel through the less dense air. She arched her back, and rose up quickly, doubling the surface time she might normally take on a breath, and shouted \u0026ldquo;MuMu!\u0026rdquo; before she dove back down beneath the waves. She saw Tutu to her left, and tried not to out-swim the speeding dolphin. Mermaids could easily surpass their dolphin friends, but whatever had set MuMu on alert might be better faced with an ally. A few seconds later, she felt MuSu\u0026rsquo;s reassuring presence in the water.\n(What\u0026rsquo;s wrong?) he asked silently.\n(MuMu sent a warning,) she answered. (I can sense her, but not clearly. There is something else out there with her, large, not a shark).\n(Keep pace with Tutu,) MuSu advised. (We will all arrive at the same time.)\nMuSu sped through the water, his dorsal fin slicing through the surface as he practically skipped across the waves. Rikki and Cleo raced behind him, falling further and further behind as their more powerful mate flew towards their sister-wife. The all heard MuMu\u0026rsquo;s warning whistle again, and then a new voice - another dolphin\u0026rsquo;s voice - a male dolphin\u0026rsquo;s voice.\nEmma pulled up as she came within eyesight of MuMu, pausing as she watched the large gray and white shape that had frightened MuMu. TuTu continued towards her sister, rushing up to her side. Together, they faced the strange male. Emma giggled. All that fuss over a guy. MuSu pulled up beside her and touched her side.\n(What\u0026rsquo;s going on?) he asked.\n(I\u0026rsquo;m not sure,) Emma answered. (But that is a male out there. Perhaps the girls are about to get a boyfriend?)\n(Hey!) the distant voice snaked down their shared CHEW. (Is MuMu alright?) Cleo\u0026rsquo;s plaintive voice asked.\nEmma turned and could see her sisters racing towards them, still far away.\n(It\u0026rsquo;s alright,) she said. (It\u0026rsquo;s a male dolphin.)\n(Oh,) Cleo thought back excitedly. (Maybe this time they won\u0026rsquo;t chase him away.)\nMuSu and Emma watched as the new male swam circles around MuMu and TuTu, whistling and clicking in a happy chatter that the mers supposed was meant to impress the two females. He nudged their dorsal fins, rubbed his pelvic fins along their sides, and kept up a constant chatter. Emma was convinced that TuTu had turned to her with a look that said, \u0026ldquo;What do you think?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good, girl\u0026rdquo; Emma said out loud so the dolphins could hear her. Then she whistled \u0026ldquo;family\u0026rdquo; as best she could.\nTuTu gave the strange male a nudge back, and then suddenly all three dolphins began to play, rub, and nudge each other as they swam away from the watching mers.\n\u0026ldquo;They look cute,\u0026rdquo; Cleo observed as she pulled up next to her pod mates. \u0026ldquo;What shall we name him?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;ve been together for all of five seconds, and you\u0026rsquo;ve got to have everyone named?\u0026rdquo; Rikki challenged.\nA sudden cascade of happy clicks and whistles filled the water and they all watched as TuTu rolled over onto her back and the new male pressed his belly into hers. They swam in unison while MuMu swam along side them.\n\u0026ldquo;That looks familiar,\u0026rdquo; Emma said, reaching out to hold MuSu\u0026rsquo;s hand.\n\u0026ldquo;Score!\u0026rdquo; Rikki said. \u0026ldquo;TuTu finally got laid!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wonder if there is any part of her that remembers being Turi?\u0026rdquo; MuSu mused as he pulled Emma close to him.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s probably gone now,\u0026rdquo; Emma said wistfully.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you miss being Martin?\u0026rdquo; Cleo asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Emma said with strength and conviction. \u0026ldquo;Martin was gone long before MuSu ever made love to me. And, becoming your twin has been the best thing that ever happened to me,\u0026rdquo; she added as she pulled Cleo into the embrace she shared with MuSu. \u0026ldquo;I was just hoping that we could \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are we about to keep ourselves busy while the dolphin\u0026rsquo;s get acquainted?\u0026rdquo; Rikki asked as she slid in next to her sisters.\n\u0026ldquo;I hope so,\u0026rdquo; Emma breathed as she reached down to stroke MuSu\u0026rsquo;s vent.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you remember our first time?\u0026rdquo; Cleo asked, as she stroked Emma\u0026rsquo;s hair. \u0026ldquo;It was so beautiful to watch you change into a mermaid. When you drank from my own breast, all I could imagine was that some day we\u0026rsquo;d be mothers together.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you want to start now?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked, with a whisper of hopefulness tucked into her voice. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to be a mother for so long now, and you\u0026rsquo;ve been waiting for us to join you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said, kissing Emma\u0026rsquo;s ears and cheeks as Emma moved MuSu\u0026rsquo;s growing cock towards her own vent. \u0026ldquo;Not yet. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why, but I know that we should go quite yet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Woman\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip; uhhhhhaaaaahhhh \u0026hellip; intuition?\u0026rdquo; MuSu asked as Emma slide herself onto his stiff penis.\n\u0026ldquo;Mermaid\u0026rsquo;s intuition,\u0026rdquo; Cleo giggled as she pressed her own vent against MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fin, which had started to vibrate.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re going to find mum,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said as she twirled her now flashing blue and white tail around all three of her pod mates', causing them to begin to slowly spin as Emma stroked herself along MuSu\u0026rsquo;s length. \u0026ldquo;Mum always wanted to be a nana, you know. After we find her, then we can become mum\u0026rsquo;s ourselves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I \u0026hellip; am \u0026hellip; ever \u0026hellip; your \u0026hellip; servant,\u0026rdquo; MuSu panted as he began to push back into Emma, his own passion building as his three mermaids pressed themselves along his body.\nEmma concentrated on NOT looking into MuSu\u0026rsquo;s eyes, even though a slowly growing part of her wanted nothing more than to complete the long wonderful trip into femininity that she had started over a year ago when she first changed from a boy, into a girl, and then moments later, into a mermaid. She turned to her right to face Cleo and caught her sister\u0026rsquo;s eyes even as they fluttered with passion as MuSu\u0026rsquo;s left fin quivered in her vent. They blinked at each other, neither needing to speak, each knowing what the other was thinking. Cleo lifted one hand and brought Emma\u0026rsquo;s face to her own, and kissed her deeply, distracting her sister from what she knew that they both most wanted to do.\nEmma moaned softly into her sister\u0026rsquo;s mouth, as she felt MuSu\u0026rsquo;s hands grab her pelvic fins and pull her hips roughly into his own. She could feel the bulbous head of his long, stiff cock buried within her body, tantalizingly close to her womb, her own internal muscles quivering and clutching at that welcome invader. She felt Rikki\u0026rsquo;s hand brush up from her hip, across her slender waist, and along her left breast, finally pulling at her stiff nipple, sending tendrils of pleasure shimmering across her body. Her birth canal clenched as her orgasm over took her, pulsing in great rolling waves of pleasure that warmed her entire body, and ended down in her flukes that were quivering rapidly in the water, adding to the pod\u0026rsquo;s slow spinning. Her breasts began to spurt multiple tiny streams of mermaid milk into the water as her orgasm built, unrelenting and undiminished as MuSu continued to pound into her quivering body. She felt her sisters join her in orgasm, their warm sweet milk mixing with hers. Three twitching and quivering mermaids were too much for MuSu, and he arched his back, groaning as he exploded into Emma, pulsing hotly within her body. Emma\u0026rsquo;s body responded to this new stimulation by cresting in yet another and even more powerful orgasm, one that nearly overwhelmed her as she clung to consciousness, her body shaking violently next to her sisters, little yelps coming from her throat as she vainly struggled for control. Soon, their pod was surrounded by a pale white cloud of mermaid milk that slowly dissipated as the four of them savored the closeness of their union.\nYes, Emma thought to herself, becoming a mermaid was the best thing that ever happened to her.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my GOD!\u0026rdquo; Cleo squealed as MuMu unexpectedly brushed her back softly as she swam by.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong?\u0026rdquo; MuSu asked, pulling himself from Emma much too quickly as far as she was concerned.\n\u0026ldquo;MuMu\u0026rsquo;s jealous,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said languidly, still enjoying the aftershocks of her own orgasm. \u0026ldquo;I guess the new dolphin isn\u0026rsquo;t as talented as our MuSu.\u0026rdquo;\nThe four of them were startled by a retort that emerged from both MuMu and Tutu that sounded suspiciously like a snort of derision or laughter. Slowly, all four mers untangled themselves and turned to face the three dolphins. They hovered a few meters from them, looking at them curiously. Then the male dolphin made the same sound as had the girls, a snort that sounded like a laugh.\n\u0026ldquo;Snort,\u0026rdquo; Cleo giggled. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s his name.\u0026rdquo;\nHarold Matthews took another drink from the canteen and savored the sweet taste of the spring water Pat had told him how to find. He had been on the island for two days, and each day he had gotten stronger. Today, he was sitting in the mountainside huts that Pat and John had built so long ago, collecting the fresh spring water that cascaded down the system of bamboo pipes that now needed some up keep and maintenance. He would happily spend the next several days performing this task for his saviors.\nHe smiled as he remembered his first hours on the island, explaining to Mark and his girls who he was and how he came to be in the ocean. He grew more and more amazed as he learned their stories as well. Over the next two days, he met most of the mers as they brought him some fish and other supplies that he needed to survive. All in all, Harold decided that he had landed in heaven. He was alive, had plenty of food, and the most beautiful creatures in the world came to bring him fish twice a day. This morning, he surprised Mark when he gladly agreed that he could not be returned to civilization because he now knew the secret of the mers. No, he was happy to stay, and he would work for the privilege.\nHe looked around at his surroundings, and thought about the stories of Phoebe and Michael, Rose and Trevor, all of whom had spent their first moments as lovers here in these huts. Sandi had begun her journey towards mermaidenhood here as well. So many stories, Harold thought to himself. How would his turn out? Would he help start a new pod, becoming a merman to mermaids, or would he lose a battle, as did Rose and Sandi, and become a mermaid himself? He knew that one day he would make the transition, but that it would be because the mers asked him to. After all, he owed them his life.\nWell, in the meantime, there was plenty of work to be done. He screwed the cap back onto the canteen, and rose to his feet to begin his inspection of the bamboo pipes. John had explained where he could find some tools hidden away, and where to find particularly tough vines to replace those that had loosened or fallen away. There would be plenty to do while he waited for fate to decide what his next step in his now strange and wonderful life would be.\nAbao looked over his crew of six, satisfied that he had assembled a good team. Each man was a natural born killer, and each of them owed Abao his life. Thinking back on his older brother\u0026rsquo;s tactics as a child, Abao decided that Manalo had thought to trick Alberto, and something backfired, which accounted for the strange events in Hong Kong. That was the sort of thing Manalo would always do, rather than simply engage in a stand up fight. Abao was always ready for a fight, and he easily threatened violence at every turn.\nHis quest to defeat Alberto and his brother had been helped by Mr. Thompson, who had finally decided to cooperate and told him that Manalo had thought to return to Alberto\u0026rsquo;s hide-a-way with the women he kidnapped from the Davao brothels to begin to build a new base of operations in that remote location, away from his father\u0026rsquo;s tyrannical control. Abao was surprised that Manalo had that much courage, but he would not make that mistake. He would surprise both his brother and Alberto, kill them all, and return as a hero to his father. It would take many days to make his way from Hong Kong to the remote island in the South Pacific, but he would be well prepared and well armed.\nHank looked out over his crew of ten, hopeful that he had assembled a good team. Along with his own family were his wife\u0026rsquo;s sister, Julie and her husband Brian. They had been incredulous at first, but when confronted with proof, both Julie and Brian were eager to jump \u0026ldquo;off the grid,\u0026rdquo; as Brian said, and build a new life as mers. They would worry about the details when they got to the island; Brian had agreed. Some details! Hank eyed Brian again, assessing the likelihood that his brother-in-law might best him in a wrestling match as Trevor had bested his own son. His twin daughters, both destined for Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pod and their transformed former brother, smiled back at him, nodding in excitement.\nFurther down along the railing was Dr. James Riddles, a retired medical researcher from Stanford that had been one of the foremost genetic scientists before he retired several years ago. Next to him stood Debra Hutchins who was something of an electronics wiz. She could make a computer do almost anything, and she had worked for him for many years. She was selected in part because she shared the same dream Trixi had \u0026hellip; she was a transsexual, and the opportunity to become a fertile female, even if the species wasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely human, was a dream she had long harbored. Finally, Pat\u0026rsquo;s sister, Bridget McDonnell and her lover, Dr. Elise Matthews, stood near the bow of the boat. Hank had first been reluctant to use his \u0026ldquo;escape\u0026rdquo; opportunity to ferry Pat\u0026rsquo;s sister, but he felt more confident when he discovered that Elise was a doctor. Although there was significant biological knowledge among the mers, Elise would be the only trained medical doctor.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we\u0026rsquo;re off,\u0026rdquo; he said as everyone watched the dock hands throw off the painter as the large yacht eased away from the slip.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s good to be back on the Freedom III, even if it is crowded with people and equipment,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;The flight down to Sydney was so long.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How long to Mermaid Island?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked, excitement shining in her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;About two weeks,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. Two weeks to work out with Brian and Julie what might actually happen when they got to the island. Two weeks of uncertainty. Two weeks of hell. How had he ever allowed his wife to talk him into this situation, he thought to himself. He had captained a company from obscurity to one of the top internet companies in the world, and yet here he was, powerless to master his own destiny with his wife.\n\u0026ldquo;Penny for your thoughts?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked him as she gave him a squeeze.\n\u0026ldquo;Later,\u0026rdquo; Hank said as he worked his way from her grasp and headed for the wheelhouse. It was going to be a long two weeks.\nConjo poured over the data records that he was altering, making sure, for the fifth time, that his own tracks were being covered, and that Malaki would be ignorant of this first step in bringing the criminal tyrant down. Fortunately, there were so many blind corners in Malaki\u0026rsquo;s organization that there would be plenty of blame to go around, and it helped that Malaki\u0026rsquo;s primary system of management was fear. Conjo stretched, his seventy year old body responding effortlessly, thanks to his daily discipline of Tai Chi. Conjo typed a few more commands into the computer, smiling. No one suspected that the evening janitor could possibly comprehend computers.\nSudhish\u0026rsquo;s codes and cooperation had given Conjo greater access to the Dimaunahan Crime Empire than he had ever hoped for, and now he could finally set into motion the longed for vengeance that had secretly dominated his life since Malaki\u0026rsquo;s father had killed his own father during the Second World War, but that was a story for another time. The cursor waited, blinking, and Conjo hit the enter key and picked up the garbage bag, and left the office.\nEmma, Rikki, and Cleo practically quivered with anticipation as MuSu stoically waited by the edge of the pool in the recently expanded Lab cave. Phoebe and Pat were working the controls to the short wave radio, trying to hold the wavering signal they were getting from Conjo.\n\u0026ldquo;Conjo, repeat last message, over,\u0026rdquo; Pat said steadily.\nThe radio crackled with static, as they waited for the response.\n\u0026ldquo;Mother Hen found,\u0026rdquo; the faint voice repeated. \u0026ldquo;Eggs will lay in two months, over.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How many eggs can we expect?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked as the Henderson girls all clapped hands over their mouths to prevent themselves from screaming. \u0026ldquo;Over.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Depends on how many wolves get into the hen house,\u0026rdquo; the voice said. \u0026ldquo;All hens will assemble in hen house in Davao in two months, over.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Excellent,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Two months, Davao. Rodger and out,\u0026rdquo; she said as she switched off the radio.\nAll three Henderson girls lifted their hands from their mouths and began screaming with joy, then as one, they launched themselves at MuSu, bowling him into the pool at the edge of the room. A happy tangle of fins, arms, and squeals of joy filled the roiling water as MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod celebrated the good news, MuSu\u0026rsquo;s yellow and black tail barely visible beneath the swirling tails of blue and white.\nPhoebe took Pat\u0026rsquo;s hand in her own as they watched the Henderson\u0026rsquo;s hug and kiss and squeal.\n\u0026ldquo;I hope the ending to this story is a happy one,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Me too,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;But there are so many things that can go wrong between now and the start of the New Year.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s October?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked. \u0026ldquo;Gosh, I had forgotten that there were months and weekends and stuff like that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s November,\u0026rdquo; Pat corrected. \u0026ldquo;The 23rd of November, according to the last message from Joy and Mac. I had forgotten that the rest of the world had seasons.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, the weather is pretty much the same here,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;Except for the storm season.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have a feeling that we are about to get some big storms,\u0026rdquo; Pat observed.\n\u0026ldquo;What? Some thing other than Abao coming?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked. \u0026ldquo;I thought Joy said it was just Malaki\u0026rsquo;s second son with a bunch of thugs who have no idea what they are in for.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, Abao is coming, and we expect him,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the unexpected arrivals that cause problems.\u0026rdquo;\nKate and Ann lay together on the bow of the Freedom III as the boat sliced through the night sea, their hands entwined as they lay on their backs facing the night sky. Their parents were asleep below, and Dr. Riddles was aft at the helm. The girls slept on the wide deck because the stateroom that might normally have been theirs was jammed full of supplies and equipment for the MMI, as everyone was calling the research facilities buried deep within the caves of Mermaid Island. The original lab cave had been expanded as the mers learned to use various acids, salts, and bio-engineered bacteria to carve out new tunnels, interior rooms, and airshafts. The large sailboat was packed with supplies, equipment, and ten people. If they ran into bad weather, which was likely during the nearly two week trip north to Mermaid island, then the twins would bunk down in the galley on the benches on either side of the table. Tonight was their first night out from Suva, and the novelty of sleeping under the stars was alluring.\n\u0026ldquo;I never get tired of this sky,\u0026rdquo; Kate said.\n\u0026ldquo;Me neither,\u0026rdquo; Ann agreed. \u0026ldquo;And the smell of the ocean, too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Kate said, drawing in a big sniff of the cool night air. \u0026ldquo;I love this place, and it will be even nicer to actually be native to this big, beautiful ocean.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to cleaning the place up,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;Did you see all the trash as we were leaving Suva? There\u0026rsquo;s stuff floating everywhere.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know how we will make much of a difference,\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;The ocean\u0026rsquo;s a really big place and there\u0026rsquo;s only a handful of mers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but we\u0026rsquo;ll think of something,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s why Dad recruited all those scientists to start coming out to the MMI over the next several years.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wonder how long it will be before someone discovers the mers?\u0026rdquo; Kate wondered.\n\u0026ldquo;Sally and Eric already did,\u0026rdquo; Ann answered. \u0026ldquo;Remember?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yea,\u0026rdquo; Kate agreed. \u0026ldquo;Joy and Mac too, but those were some very smart people. I hope the mers can be secret for a very long time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I hope we get to be mers for a very long time,\u0026rdquo; Ann said, squeezing her sister\u0026rsquo;s hand.\n\u0026ldquo;How many more days?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked softly, turning to face her sister.\n\u0026ldquo;A week, maybe a few days more,\u0026rdquo; Ann offered tentatively.\n\u0026ldquo;Any regrets?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; Ann responded, shifting to face her sister in the starlight.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Kate said, turning to face her sister. \u0026ldquo;Rushing a sorority, homecoming, the fall Screw-Your-Roommate Dance, hanging out at The Troubadour, losing your virginity, you know \u0026hellip; college.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Regrets, I\u0026rsquo;ve had a few,\u0026rdquo; Ann began to sing softly on of their family\u0026rsquo;s favorite songs. \u0026ldquo;When I bit off more than I could chew.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But through it all,\u0026rdquo; Kate sang out more loudly into the quiet night air. \u0026ldquo;When there was doubt, I ate it up and spit it out.\u0026rdquo;\nTogether the girls sang, \u0026ldquo;I faced it all and I stood tall; And did it my way.\u0026rdquo;\nAs their soft, sweet voices faded into the sound of the waves slapping against the side of their sailboat, they both could hear Dr. Riddles in his elderly tenor continue, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve loved, I\u0026rsquo;ve laughed and cried. I\u0026rsquo;ve had my fill; my share of losing.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd their three voices joined together for \u0026ldquo;And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing.\u0026rdquo;\nFor a moment the night air filled with the sounds of giggles and laughter, and then from below the deck, the clear baritone of Hank Connor echoed from below, \u0026ldquo;To think I did all that; And may I say - not in a shy way.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd now all four voices finished, \u0026ldquo;No, oh no not me, I did it my way.\u0026rdquo;\nThen Janice, Julie, and Brian interrupted with, \u0026ldquo;For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then Debra, Bridget, and Elise jumped in with \u0026quot; To say the things he truly feels; And not the words of one who kneels.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd then everyone joined in for, \u0026ldquo;The record shows I took the blows - And did it my way!\u0026rdquo;\nThe night air filled with the sound of clapping, laughing, and giggling.\n\u0026ldquo;Nope,\u0026rdquo; Ann sighed. \u0026ldquo;Not a single regret.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Me neither,\u0026rdquo; Kate agreed, and kissed her sister soundly on the lips.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright everyone,\u0026rdquo; Hank\u0026rsquo;s voice floated up. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve got about ten days of steady sailing, so get some rest.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Dad,\u0026rdquo; Kate and Ann shouted.\nThe boat silently sliced through the glimmering ocean, the slight breeze keeping their speed to about 12 knots. The girls lay quietly, listening to the sounds of the sail rippling in the wind, the steady slap of the water against the hull, and the occasional cry of a far away bird. Kate sat up and looked down at her body in the starlight. She was wearing a light sweat suit over her bikini as protection against the cool, night air. She stretched her legs out, pointing her toes towards the bow, imagining a green and gold tailfin extending another foot or two beyond the ends of her feet, shimmering and glistening in the starlight.\n\u0026ldquo;Stop pretending,\u0026rdquo; Ann whispered. \u0026ldquo;It will only drive you crazy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Like you don\u0026rsquo;t?\u0026rdquo; Kate challenged. \u0026ldquo;I see you doing that all the time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, what of it?\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what we think it will feel like, Rose said. It\u0026rsquo;s beyond imagination.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s not right about everything,\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;Besides, Rose is still learning how to be a girl.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wonder how Dad and Brian are doing?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked conspiratorially.\n\u0026ldquo;Who do you think will go girl?\u0026rdquo; Kate whispered back.\n\u0026ldquo;Uncle Brian,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;If Dad goes, then all the Connor men will have disappeared.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;Uncle Brian has always been more hotheaded, you know, more like a guy. I just can\u0026rsquo;t see how he would agree to become a mermaid. Besides, he\u0026rsquo;s younger and stronger than Dad, if it came to that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think it will come to that?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Kate mused. \u0026ldquo;I think Mom and Aunt Julie have something worked out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do you know,\u0026rdquo; Ann demanded.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;I just have a feeling, that\u0026rsquo;s all. I mean, if we really thought about it, Mom should be the leader of the pod.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do you know that she won\u0026rsquo;t be?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;Who will be in charge of our pod? Our older sister?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nope, we will,\u0026rdquo; Ann said, smelling the night air again. \u0026ldquo;Actually, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I care one way or the other, about Dad and Uncle Brian or even who will be in charge of our pod. As long as I have my twin for one of my pod-mates, I think I could handle anything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Me too, Sis,\u0026rdquo; Kate agreed, leaning over and kissing her sister tenderly.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure that you have everything?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked worriedly.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Mom,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;We will be fine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Trixi!\u0026rdquo; Homa said quickly, nodding her head at the edge of the lagoon where MuSu and his girls waited impatiently with Wong\u0026rsquo;s pod for Mark\u0026rsquo;s pod to join them.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Trixi asked. \u0026ldquo;Their mother is still alive; Pat is the closet thing to a Mom I\u0026rsquo;ll ever know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, Danni would be the closest thing to a Mom you\u0026rsquo;ll ever know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said laughing. \u0026ldquo;She would be here to fuss over you if she wasn\u0026rsquo;t watching all the children this morning. She sends her love and her warning to listen to Mark, and to really keep an eye on MuSu\u0026rsquo;s girls. They might let emotion take over and that could endanger us all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we know,\u0026rdquo; Binah said. \u0026ldquo;And we will be careful, and we will listen to Mark, when we ought to, and we will come back with Mrs. Henderson and Sudish\u0026rsquo;s sisters.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Remember that none of them know who will be rescuing them,\u0026rdquo; Pat worried. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll have to keep that walkie-talkie safe and dry, because that\u0026rsquo;s the only way to signal them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Mom,\u0026rdquo; Mark said smiling. \u0026ldquo;I know a thing or two about keeping equipment dry and usable while working underwater.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You won\u0026rsquo;t risk anyone to exposure or capture?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We are there as a back up measure only,\u0026rdquo; Mark reassured her. \u0026ldquo;We will let Michael Thompson handle everything, but we are prepared to provide any necessary distractions, cover, or healing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You will report back every morning at daybreak?\u0026rdquo; Pat worried.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said, tapping her tiara lightly. \u0026ldquo;Everyday.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a brisk swim to Davao,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;And we can\u0026rsquo;t swim at top speed, so, we had better get going.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Just make sure you bring back everyone ali\u0026ndash;oh, sorry,\u0026rdquo; she finished clapping her hand to her mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;I will bring back my whole team,\u0026rdquo; Mark said without flinching. \u0026ldquo;This time, the stakes are even higher, and I have to believe that I survived Viet Nam for a reason.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mark will bring us all back,\u0026rdquo; Homa said fiercely, hugging her mate tightly as they knelt together in the shallow surf. \u0026ldquo;I know it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes!\u0026rdquo; both Binah and Trixi added. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you worry about a thing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have the tracking devices?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, looking over the four mers as they swayed in the surf that rolled up to their waists. Each of them had a utility belt that hung around their hips above their pelvic fins. A variety of pouches, nets, and clips clung the belt, as sleekly as possible, and held all kinds of equipment, knives, and even some Russian underwater firearms. Unfortunately, The belts prevented the mers from achieving their highest speeds. Thus a trip that might take a few days unencumbered was going to take a few weeks. However, the emergency resources they provided on long trips into strange waters was worth the extra time. Besides, they would easily reach Davao before the rescue happened. They planned to explore the area and make maps of significant underwater resources.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve gone over the lists and the plans three times just this morning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;I just want to make sure.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll be fine,\u0026rdquo; Trixi promised. \u0026ldquo;We have to get going, or Wong won\u0026rsquo;t be able to stop MuSu and his girls from leaving without us, and all this planning will be for nothing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, go,\u0026rdquo; Pat sighed. \u0026ldquo;Report everyday!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Everyday,\u0026rdquo; Trixi shouted as she twisted her body in the surf and plunged into a wave. Within minutes Mark\u0026rsquo;s pod surfaced near MuSu\u0026rsquo;s and Wong\u0026rsquo;s, and with a final wave all twelve mers waved goodbye to Pat and disappeared into the sea.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure that this is what you want?\u0026rdquo; Julie asked her sister, barely believing what she was saying.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, looking at her younger sister. They both shared many of the same physical characteristics but little else. They were both short, petite, brunette, and nicely curvy, though Julie filled a C cup whereas Janice was more a healthy B, a fact that had briefly dominated their rivalry when they were teenagers, Julie a well-developed 13 year old, while Janice at 17 actually looked younger than her younger sister. Although neither sister had yet seen Rose\u0026rsquo;s transformed self, both Janice and Julie could pass for sisters of a young Elizabeth Taylor with the right lighting and makeup. Julie, like her sister, had managed to stay youthful even as she crossed over into her mid-thirties, and Brian often commented on how she looked the same at 35 that she did at 25. The sisters had grown particularly close after Julie discovered that she was unable to have children, and so she devoted her self to her nephew and two nieces. Brian had taken the news particularly hard, because he had long wanted a family, but he loved his wife, and so made the best of things.\n\u0026ldquo;What about Brian?\u0026rdquo; Julie asked. \u0026ldquo;I mean, I am happy to share him with you, but well \u0026hellip; how will we get him to help Hank?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The important fact for Brian to focus upon is that he will finally become the father that he always wanted to be,\u0026rdquo; Janice continued. \u0026ldquo;Getting over his homophobia, as far as Hank is concerned is a small price to pay for such a miracle.\u0026rdquo;,\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Julie sighed. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to be a mother, but will Hank want to be a mother?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s first work on becoming a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Janice smiled. \u0026ldquo;Then we can work on motherhood.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you think that Hank will come around on his own?\u0026rdquo; Julie asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;We have some time, just leave that to me. Patience.\u0026rdquo;\nThey both looked over the railing at the sea as it roiled past the boat. Janice loved her sister, but knew that she was more like Danni, a mother in waiting. While any pod would benefit from having a mermaid who wanted nothing more than to nurture others, Janice had always wanted more, which is what drew her to Hank twenty years earlier. Janice knew that the mermaids were the real intellectual and moral leaders of this new society, and in the same way that she had exercised a level of power and influence through Hank and his career, she knew that both she and her husband would wield more influence as mermaids. She had carefully watched Pat and Phoebe, Galina, Emma, and Sally and Alexis lead each of their pods and collectively lead the mers. As far as she could tell, the same pattern emerged with the newer pods that transitioned since she had last been on the island.\nThe mermen were certainly important, Janice thought, and suspected that Julie couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to be ravished by her husband as a mermaid. Janice admitted silently to herself that she had fantasized about that moment as well, even that it might be her brother-in-law rather than her husband that did the ravishing. The mermen were certainly the sexual powerhouses of the new species, keeping two or three mermaids satisfied, but their natural aggression towards one another, despite their intellectual knowledge that it did them no good to feel that way, diminished their usefulness as leaders in many situations because they literally couldn\u0026rsquo;t control themselves.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey good looking,\u0026rdquo; Brian said as he slid his arms around Julie\u0026rsquo;s waist from behind. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s up?\u0026rdquo;\nJanice turned to look at her future pod-mate. Brian had the same rangy athleticism that Hank did, but he had been an air force pilot and had the natural swagger and sense of physical prowess that many in the military developed. His dark brown hair was flecked with a touch of gray, which she could see as it fluttered in the wind, and his dark brown eyes matched both hers and Julie\u0026rsquo;s. Brian was a good man, Janice knew, and he was also devilishly handsome in that cocky, still a little boy at heart, sort of way. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t as thoughtful as her Hank, but that was all the more reason why Janice was convinced that Hank should join her as a mermaid, and together they would lead the pod.\n\u0026ldquo;We were just talking about that,\u0026rdquo; Janice answered.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s that?\u0026rdquo; Brain asked. \u0026ldquo;Me and Hank?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And who says that pilots are all swagger and no brains?\u0026rdquo; Janice teased.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m smarter than I look,\u0026rdquo; Brian said, his mouth twitching with a wry smile. \u0026ldquo;You know, we could solve this whole mess by just having two separate pods.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;NO!\u0026rdquo; both Julie and Janice said together, as Julie broke from Brian\u0026rsquo;s embrace. Now, each sister turned, shoulder to shoulder, and backed Brian up against the bulkhead behind him.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve talked about this,\u0026rdquo; Julie said. \u0026ldquo;There is no-one else I want to call my sister-wife other than my sister. We settled that long ago.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know, honey,\u0026rdquo; Brian said. \u0026ldquo;But you know that I cannot agree to become Hank\u0026rsquo;s mermaid; I just can\u0026rsquo;t do it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How would you feel about helping Hank to become your mermaid?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously?\u0026rdquo; Brain looked truly shocked. \u0026ldquo;Hank? He would agree to this? I thought we were going to fight it out, like Trevor and Robbie\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Rose, now,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;Fighting is usually the wrong solution to most problems, but men always think that problems look like nails, and they have the right hammer as a solution.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sometimes you have to fight,\u0026rdquo; Brian protested.\n\u0026ldquo;And sometimes you don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;You just be patient and refuse to talk about it until after we are on the island. You give me enough time, and Hank will come to you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you want this for your own husband?\u0026rdquo; Brian asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I want that for my pod-mate, truest love, and first champion of my heart,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;You men get too hung up on all that macho crap. There is more than one way to be truly in love with someone. Besides, you\u0026rsquo;ve always wondered what it would be like, with Julie and I, haven\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo;\nBrian shot a guilty glance at his wife and shook his head.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t lie,\u0026rdquo; Julie said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve thought about it too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have?\u0026rdquo; Brain asked, scandalized.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, for goodness' sake,\u0026rdquo; Julie sputtered. \u0026ldquo;We have been talking about becoming pod mates for the past few months. Do you think we didn\u0026rsquo;t know what happens in mer-pods, or have you given up all hope of ever becoming a father?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I \u0026hellip; er \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; just,\u0026rdquo; Brian said.\n\u0026ldquo;No, you didn\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Julie said, taking her sister\u0026rsquo;s hand in her own. \u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t think it through, did you? Well, we have, and perhaps you should start.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked in sultry tone. \u0026ldquo;Have you thought about it?\u0026rdquo; she finished as she pressed her own bikini-clad breast into her sister\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;Ummmm,\u0026rdquo; Brain said, covering his crotch with his hand.\n\u0026ldquo;Good, you\u0026rsquo;re finally starting to,\u0026rdquo; Julie said, as she moved her own shoulders as well, pressing her breast into Janice\u0026rsquo;s. It definitely felt exciting, and a little weird, but that would all change once they were mers, she knew. \u0026ldquo;You keep thinking about it, and keep your mouth shut.\u0026rdquo;\nBrian nodded, watching his wife and his sister-in-law gently move against each other.\nA large, hulking figure sat slouched on a chair in a large luxury bathroom in the Watergate Hotel. Behind him stood an elegant older woman with only slightly graying hair. She was wearing rubber gloves and a smock.\n\u0026ldquo;Hold still,\u0026rdquo; Joy ordered. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re making this harder than it needs to be.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This is girly stuff,\u0026rdquo; Mac groused. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have my hair dyed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have to dye my hair too,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Just wait until we get to the make up,\u0026rdquo; she teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Not gonna happen,\u0026rdquo; Mac stated firmly.\n\u0026ldquo;Wanna bet?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked as she applied the last of the hair dye to Mac\u0026rsquo;s progressively darker hair. \u0026ldquo;We have to meet with your people tomorrow, and the military is nothing if not a stickler for normative behavior.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What the hell does that mean,\u0026rdquo; Mac demanded.\n\u0026ldquo;That you have to look exactly like you did before you left, except for a slight tan,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Now shut up and be still.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my love,\u0026rdquo; Mac said ironically.\n\u0026ldquo;Any more of that,\u0026rdquo; Joy warned. \u0026ldquo;And you\u0026rsquo;ll be the next mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ha!\u0026rdquo; Mac retorted. \u0026ldquo;Try it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Besides,\u0026rdquo; Joy continued. \u0026ldquo;I have a special effect planned for tomorrow night when we meet Brent and Annette.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s that?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked carefully.\n\u0026ldquo;You just do as I tell you,\u0026rdquo; Joy said with mock sternness. \u0026ldquo;Or you\u0026rsquo;ll be a mermaid before you know it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my love,\u0026rdquo; Mac said as he ducked.\nHank lay on his back, feeling each crest in the waves as their boat pounded across the angry sea. They were now four days out of Suva and about a week away from Mermaid Island. They were making slow time, the winds were not working in their favor, but that was just fine with Hank. He had begun to dread arriving on the island. How could he have let his wife talk him into this state of uncertainty? He was a man who made decisions, who captained his destiny, and who had just created the world\u0026rsquo;s best funded and newest institute for the study of marine mammals. Of course, he was about to become one of those mammals, but he had assumed that he would be one of the mermen. But Janice, Julie, and Brian had been adamant about not deciding until they got to the island. He turned and propped his head up with his right arm, looking at his wife of over twenty years, who still looked and acted ten years younger than she was.\nJanice Connor was a true beauty, he thought to himself as he watched her sleep peacefully. He remembered the first time he saw her, back in college. God, it was such a cliché. He had just run from the Student Union because he was late for class when he plowed into the petite brunette, causing her books to scatter. He awkwardly apologized and helped her pick up her books, and by the time they had gathered her last book, Hank was lost in the dark pools of her eyes, and he never made it to class that day. They had made an odd couple at first. He towered over her with his tall, athletic, blond-haired, blue-eyed, broad shouldered body. He was actually a computer geek on the inside, but he looked like a surfer god on the outside. He was not, however, always successful with the ladies, and Janice had helped him out of his geeky shell. Janice, on the other hand, was a gregarious and vivacious \u0026ldquo;popular\u0026rdquo; girl, always surrounded by boys, but she saw Hank\u0026rsquo;s inner gentleness from the start, and besides, he was a hunk, smart, and likely to make a fortune.\nJanice cracked open an eye and watched her husband watch her. He always thought that he was in command, being forceful, and taking charge, but in reality, his fortune, his career, and even his children were as much the result of her efforts and leadership as his own. Janice closed her eye and pretended to stretch in her sleep, rolling slightly onto her back so that her small, firm breasts pushed up into her tee shirt. She knew that her petite curvy body drove Hank crazy, and with the storm covering any noise they might make, she was determined to seduce her husband, in more ways than one.\nHank watched Janice\u0026rsquo;s breast rise and fall with her breathing, mesmerized by the round sloping flesh that rose from her chest. He felt his own cock twitch, stirring between his legs. He reached forward with his left hand and lightly stroked the slight indentation of her nipple, making feather light circles around Janice\u0026rsquo;s large nipples. She moaned softly, encouraging him to do more. He let his hand drift over the entirety of her breast, dragging his fingernails over the cotton tee shirt, causing her nipple to stiffen further. Janice rolled fully onto her back and lifted her hands over her head, stretching, as Hank began to lightly stroke both of her breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;Hummmm,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;Keep going.\u0026rdquo;\nHank continued to gently stroke and squeeze his wife\u0026rsquo;s breasts, watching as both nipples rose up and poked through the tee shirt. He took one and lightly pinched it between his thumb and forefinger.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah,\u0026rdquo; Janice sighed. \u0026ldquo;You do that so well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I aim to please,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, feeling his cock begin to fill with blood. He shifted his hips to allow his cock to rise, but his track shorts stopped it mid-rise.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get out of these things,\u0026rdquo; Janice suggested as she lowered her hands to the hem of her tee shirt and lifted it up over her head. Hank watched as her breasts bounced free of the tee shirt, now slightly sagging after three children, and her dark nipples had grown significantly when she was pregnant with Robbie.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on,\u0026rdquo; Janice urged, nodding at his shorts as she pushed her own shorts down her slender legs, kicking them off the small bed as she did so.\nHank flipped onto his back and pushed his shorts down, and when they were around his ankles, Janice pounced on him, straddling him over his thighs.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t move,\u0026rdquo; she said, as she reached behind her and took the drawstrings of Hank\u0026rsquo;s gym shorts and tied them firmly around his ankles. \u0026ldquo;There, now you are almost a mer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Kinky,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, his cock straining.\n\u0026ldquo;Like what you see?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked as she shook her hair over her shoulders and brought her hands up to her breasts, squeezing and stroking them gently as she rocked her hips back and forth on Hank\u0026rsquo;s thighs.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Hank breathed, feeling the heat from Janice\u0026rsquo;s sex ebb and flow as she stroked herself closer and then further away from his now aching penis.\n\u0026ldquo;You like my breasts?\u0026rdquo; she asked as she lowered her torso over her husband\u0026rsquo;s body. \u0026ldquo;Are they pretty?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, god yes,\u0026rdquo; Hank said as her thick nipples brushed across his lips and face as she swung her shoulders from side to side, her hands pinning his wrists to the bed.\n\u0026ldquo;Soon, you will be sucking on a mermaid\u0026rsquo;s breast, changing into a mer yourself,\u0026rdquo; she whispered in his ear as she pressed a nipple into his mouth. \u0026ldquo;Yes, suck it. Oh, god it feels so good. That\u0026rsquo;s it \u0026hellip; more. Now, do the other one. Yes! Ah, you have no idea how good that feels, my breasts, my life-giving breasts hanging from my chest, feeding you. That\u0026rsquo;s right, suck it more.\u0026rdquo;\nHank continued to suck at his wife\u0026rsquo;s breast while she ground her crotch into his abdomen, leaving a wet trail of her juices.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, uh, uh,\u0026rdquo; she intoned as she rocked her hips back and forth, pushing her mound into his stomach and hips. A small orgasm over took her, and she squealed.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, yes!\u0026rdquo; she cried, lifting her breast from his mouth, savoring the pulses that emanated from her womb. Hank watched with equal parts love and lust as his beautiful wife quivered above him. She refocused on her lover, and she reached down to play with his small nipples.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s too bad you don\u0026rsquo;t have anything like these for me to suck on,\u0026rdquo; she said as she looked down at her own breasts. \u0026ldquo;Maybe we can make these grow,\u0026rdquo; she continued as she pulled on his nipples, causing him to arch his back. \u0026ldquo;You have been thinking about it haven\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;About what?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked, his mind awash with lust and the fantasy his wife was spinning for him.\n\u0026ldquo;About breasts,\u0026rdquo; she said, stroking his hairy chest as she resumed rocking her hips along his stomach, pushing against the top of his cock.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he gasped, trying to lift his hips so that his cock could find her wet slit, but the shorts around his ankles prevented him from getting the maximum leverage, and she scooted her hips forward.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t lie,\u0026rdquo; she said as she leaned down and pulled one of his nipples into her mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah,\u0026rdquo; Hank moaned as his wife\u0026rsquo;s mouth bit down on his abused nipple. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t what?\u0026rdquo; Janice demanded, moving to the other nipple and lavishing her tongue around his stiff, tiny nipple. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t suck on you? How about if I suck on this?\u0026rdquo; she asked as she reached behind her to grab his cock. \u0026ldquo;Would that be O.K.?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Hank floundered.\nJanice didn\u0026rsquo;t wait for a more coherent answer and spun her small, light body around, lowering her hips over Hank\u0026rsquo;s face as she deep throated his cock in one, swift gulp.\n\u0026ldquo;Ooohhhh,\u0026rdquo; Hank moaned as he felt his cock head compress against the back of his wife\u0026rsquo;s throat. She slid it out with a pop, and then pushed her vagina into his face.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you wonder what it\u0026rsquo;s like to have multiple orgasms?\u0026rdquo; she asked as she felt him tongue the outer edge of her pussy. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to have several more before I let you have one. Do you think that\u0026rsquo;s fair?\u0026rdquo;\nShe ground her hips down as Hank lapped at her wet cunt. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the matter? Cat got your tongue?\u0026rdquo; She lowered her head back to his cock, and toyed with the head, sliding her lips back and forth over its silky helmet. \u0026ldquo;Ummmm, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you like to have more than one orgasm?\u0026rdquo; She hoped that Hank wouldn\u0026rsquo;t remember that all mers were capable of multiple orgasms in a single session, but she had the feeling that he had been avoiding thinking about sex. He was thinking about it now, however, as she felt his tongue dive into her love tunnel, causing her hips to spasm.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right there,\u0026rdquo; she ordered as she felt Hank\u0026rsquo;s chin press into her clit. \u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; oh, aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; she moaned as her second orgasm rolled through her body.\nHank felt the gush of liquid flood his face, and watched fascinated as Janice\u0026rsquo;s hips shook with her pleasure. What was she doing to him? Was she trying to get him to agree to become the mermaid? How did she manage to do this to him?\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Hank,\u0026rdquo; Janice moaned. \u0026ldquo;You were always the best.\u0026rdquo;\nShe turned around again, pressing her breasts into his face, rubbing her own juices over her tits. \u0026ldquo;Your stubble is a bit rough, but if we were mermaids, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have that problem.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mermen don\u0026rsquo;t shave either,\u0026rdquo; Hank mumbled as Janice\u0026rsquo;s breasts passed back and forth over his face.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure, but can\u0026rsquo;t you imagine what it would be like to be like me?\u0026rdquo; she asked, ignoring his comment. \u0026ldquo;Feeling your breasts hanging down, your nipples stiff and sensitive? I love the way my breasts make me feel.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are you doing?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked, feeling a strange pressure in his chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Loving you,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, as she threw her leg back over her husband and stuffed his cock into her cunt. \u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; ah, yes. We will \u0026hellip; always be lovers, you and I,\u0026rdquo; she said as she increased the strokes she made with her hips. \u0026ldquo;No matter \u0026hellip; uh \u0026hellip; what happens.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I will always \u0026hellip; oh, god \u0026hellip; love you too,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, feeling the familiar feeling of his own orgasm rising up more quickly than he expected.\n\u0026ldquo;Give \u0026hellip; it \u0026hellip; to \u0026hellip; me,\u0026rdquo; Janice urged, recognizing the look in her husband\u0026rsquo;s face. \u0026ldquo;Do it,\u0026rdquo; she commanded as her hips moved with greater urgency and power. \u0026ldquo;Yes \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; want \u0026hellip; to \u0026hellip; feel \u0026hellip; it!\u0026rdquo;\nHank could hold out no longer, and felt his gut clench as he spurted his cum into his wife.\n\u0026ldquo;Yessssssss,\u0026rdquo; Janice hissed as her third orgasm rushed to meet Hank\u0026rsquo;s, and together they collapsed into each other\u0026rsquo;s arms. After many moments of listening to the storm outside, Hank pushed a strand of his wife\u0026rsquo;s hair away from his mouth, and let out a sigh.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked tenderly.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you serious?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\nJanice lifted up her head and looked down lovingly into the eyes of the man she had loved for over twenty years. She sensed her opening. \u0026ldquo;Think about it. Which way would we be happier, with you as my sisterwife or with Brian?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Hum,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, looking back up into the eyes of the most beautiful woman he had ever known. \u0026ldquo;I never thought about it like that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How were you thinking about it?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;As me not losing my manhood to Brian,\u0026rdquo; Hank said.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you remember what the mers said about manhood before we left?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, what?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The mermen are not the ones in charge,\u0026rdquo; she said and lowered herself back down to kiss him soundly.\nThe two couples sat in a tastefully decorated living room in a modest home in Northern Virginia. A tall, slender woman finished serving martinis to her guests and sat down next to the large man in a navy uniform.\n\u0026ldquo;Cheers,\u0026rdquo; she said, raising her glass. \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rsquo;s to Mac\u0026rsquo;s retirement, and not a moment too soon.\u0026rdquo;\nThe four clinked glasses and each sipped from their glasses.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s about time,\u0026rdquo; agreed Brent Dawson, former Commandant of the Marine Corps and an old friend to Mac Bennett. \u0026ldquo;I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to retire.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; Mac began, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a long story, and it\u0026rsquo;s why we wanted to meet you here. You\u0026rsquo;re sure this place is clean?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If it\u0026rsquo;s not,\u0026rdquo; Brent laughed. \u0026ldquo;There will be several heads that will roll.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Annette, this includes your protocols,\u0026rdquo; Joy said.\nAnnette Dawson looked at her husband of the past thirty-five years and raised an eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;Joy Simpson was E - 9, she knows your file,\u0026rdquo; Brent explained to his wife, a retired CIA officer like Joy. \u0026ldquo;You were covert, and she was a field op. I never told her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But you knew that I was in the Company,\u0026rdquo; Joy laughed.\n\u0026ldquo;I had to,\u0026rdquo; Brent explained. \u0026ldquo;You were advance for me back in the 70s.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right. I remember now. Annette?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked. \u0026ldquo;Clean?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Give me a minute,\u0026rdquo; Annette said rising. \u0026ldquo;And no lip from you,\u0026rdquo; she said shaking an accusatory finger at her husband. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s clean, and then there\u0026rsquo;s clean.\u0026rdquo; Annette returned with a small device that looked like a radio and set it down on the coffee table. She then turned and drew the curtains over the windows on both the front and back of the room. \u0026ldquo;Now, we\u0026rsquo;re clean.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve met with a very select group of upper military and civilian intelligence officers, including the commander general of Blackgate Operations,\u0026rdquo; Mac began. \u0026ldquo;And there is one last mission that he would like the two of you to consider joining us on.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I retired, Mac,\u0026rdquo; Brent answered wearily. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a few years older than you, and I don\u0026rsquo;t really think I\u0026rsquo;ve got a Blackgate left in me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wait until you\u0026rsquo;ve heard everything I have to say before you answer,\u0026rdquo; Mac advised. \u0026ldquo;And trust me, most of what you\u0026rsquo;re about to hear will seem absolutely unbelievable. But you will have to believe me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s a hell of a way to start,\u0026rdquo; Annette said.\n\u0026ldquo;Joy?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked, and Joy reached into her purse and handed Mac a plastic bag with a cloth sealed inside. He took out the cloth and began to scrub his face and hair. With each stroke his face appeared to get younger and less wrinkled, while his hair grew darker and thicker.\n\u0026ldquo;Mac,\u0026rdquo; Brent asked breathlessly, leaning forward off the couch. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s in that cloth? The fountain of youth?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s only make-up remover in the cloth,\u0026rdquo; Mac explained, showing them the dirty cloth. \u0026ldquo;The fountain of youth is inside our bodies,\u0026rdquo; he finished, waving his hand at Joy who had also begun to scrub off her own make up.\nThirteen days, two days later than expected, or at least that is what the charts had predicted. Hank Connors leaned against the wheel of the Freedom III and looked at the small island on the horizon that rose dramatically from the sea, it\u0026rsquo;s dormant volcano jutting into the northern sky. The rising sun to the east cast sharp shadows across the face of the volcano, dramatically highlighting the crags and fissures that marked the southern face of the mountain. The sharp cry of birds would soon awaken the rest of the crew, but for the moment, Hank had the sea, sun, and wind to himself.\n\u0026ldquo;Morning, Captain,\u0026rdquo; Bridget McDonnell said, Pat(rick)\u0026rsquo;s sister, as she emerged from the gangway blinking in the morning sun. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the forecast for today?\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve arrived,\u0026rdquo; Hank said simply, waving his hand towards the bow. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s Mermaid Island, or the Kiribati regional island #399, or the home of the new International Marine Mammal Institute, depending on your preference.\u0026rdquo;\nBridget turned her face to the north and beheld her future home for the first time. Pat\u0026rsquo;s descriptions did not do the place justice. Hollywood could not have created a more picturesque island paradise.\n\u0026ldquo;How much longer?\u0026rdquo; Bridget asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll be in the lagoon there by this afternoon,\u0026rdquo; Hank assured her. \u0026ldquo;It will take most of the afternoon to get everything situated, and then you can start on the transitions by tomorrow morning, probably, though Kate and Ann will probably go tonight, given what Pat just told Janice last night.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Transition,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said, her forty-something face breaking into enormous smile. \u0026ldquo;I still cannot believe everything that you\u0026rsquo;ve told me. It\u0026rsquo;s just too incredible.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s all true,\u0026rdquo; Hank said without enthusiasm.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; asked Bridget. \u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t you excited?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes and no,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;You know who the merman in your pod is going to be.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my goodness,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry. You and Brian haven\u0026rsquo;t sorted things out yet?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Hank sighed. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s complicated.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not from my perspective,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said.\n\u0026ldquo;What does that mean?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked warily.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been with both men and women in my life,\u0026rdquo; Bridget explained, sitting next to Hank in a sisterly sort of way. \u0026ldquo;And frankly, it\u0026rsquo;s better between women than it is between a man and a woman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not what the mermaids say,\u0026rdquo; Hank said coolly.\n\u0026ldquo;What do they say?\u0026rdquo; Bridget asked haughtily.\n\u0026ldquo;The mer-bonds changes some things,\u0026rdquo; Hank explained. \u0026ldquo;And even though all the mermaids have sex with one another, they become very attached to their merman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just as long as I don\u0026rsquo;t have to give up my Elise,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. \u0026ldquo;I can put up with any merman, and besides, Dr. Riddles is such a sweet man. I\u0026rsquo;m sure that we will get along wonderfully as a pod. Goodness, that sounds so strange: a pod.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m told that everyone gets used to it,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, looking over Pat\u0026rsquo;s sister. Bridget was in her early forties, slightly overweight, but she had a pretty face and a generous smile. She had the family light brown/auburn hair, but otherwise looked like a refugee from the 1960s, with her peasant skirt and loose blouse. \u0026ldquo;Is Elise up yet?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Bridget answered. \u0026ldquo;Should I wake her?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Hank answered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m enjoying this talk.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are?\u0026rdquo; Bridget challenged. \u0026ldquo;You act like you\u0026rsquo;re about to be shot.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can I ask you a question?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said, folding her hands in her lap. \u0026ldquo;Shoot.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you think of men who become mermaids?\u0026rdquo; he asked slowly.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, you don\u0026rsquo;t mess around, do you?\u0026rdquo; Bridget smiled. \u0026ldquo;I got nothing against men; hell, I was married to one. But I\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed both being a woman and being with a woman, so I figure any man lucky enough to switch teams is a wiser person for having played for both sides.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wiser?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said, settling into her topic. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m wiser for having dated both men and women. I know more about both because I could see differences and similarities that are otherwise invisible to a purely heterosexual person.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What differences?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Most people tend to stereotype the genders,\u0026rdquo; Bridget explained. \u0026ldquo;You know, sugar and spice and everything nice, or snips and snails and puppy dog tails.\u0026rdquo;\nHank nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;Anyway,\u0026rdquo; Bridget continued. \u0026ldquo;There are all kinds of women and all kinds of men, and the usual stereotypes don\u0026rsquo;t do you much good when it comes to any particular individual.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s it?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t sneer,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said sagely. \u0026ldquo;Tell me how many people you know that actually operationalize that knowledge.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, not many,\u0026rdquo; Hank admitted after a moment\u0026rsquo;s reflection.\n\u0026ldquo;Wiser,\u0026rdquo; Bridget concluded.\nThey both sat together, watching the sunrise and the island draw nearer.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you think of Debra?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s alright,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. \u0026ldquo;The accent is a bit much.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s from England, you know,\u0026rdquo; Hank offered. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t fault her for that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, no,\u0026rdquo; Bridget protested. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s alright. It\u0026rsquo;s just that I\u0026rsquo;ve never met a transsexual before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;Someone on neither team.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, more like the monkey in the middle,\u0026rdquo; Bridget suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;You haven\u0026rsquo;t talked to her much?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, not really,\u0026rdquo; Bridget admitted. \u0026ldquo;She keeps pretty much to herself. She only really talks to Dr. Riddles.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He asked that everyone call him Jim,\u0026rdquo; Hank admonished.\n\u0026ldquo;So?\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. \u0026ldquo;Have you looked at him? He\u0026rsquo;s more saintly and doctor-ly than Marcus Welby, MD.\u0026rdquo;\nHank laughed softly at that one. \u0026ldquo;Yes, he does have that air about him. But I do think you\u0026rsquo;ll score more points if you start calling him Jim, and I think he likes you a lot.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He does, eh?\u0026rdquo; Bridget asked, looking down at her dumpy, middle-aged self. \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because he is wiser than most of us,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;And he doesn\u0026rsquo;t worry about appearances as much as most people do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;True story,\u0026rdquo; Bridget admitted. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m lucky that you recruited him and Pat asked you to recruit me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It will take all kinds of people to begin this new society,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;And who knows what the future will bring. We will all just do the best that we can, and trust to the future.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What, you don\u0026rsquo;t trust in God?\u0026rdquo; Bridget asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you?\u0026rdquo; Hank returned.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I was raised Catholic,\u0026rdquo; Bridget began. \u0026ldquo;But now I\u0026rsquo;m more spiritual, I guess. What about you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Me?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. Greenpeace has been the religion of the Connor family for the past twenty years, and we feel a great obligation for environmental stewardship, but traditional religions have not been part of that mix.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps that\u0026rsquo;s why Pat asked me to come,\u0026rdquo; Bridget mused.\n\u0026ldquo;Why\u0026rsquo;s that?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Someone needs to start a new mer-religion,\u0026rdquo; she beamed; inspired by a possible purpose to her joining the community of mers her former brother had started.\n\u0026ldquo;God help us,\u0026rdquo; Hank muttered to himself, quietly.\nMichael Thompson looked over his crew, satisfied that he had made the best choices he could. He had learned that one of his lawyers in the United States who handled sales of his yachts along the east coast was also an aficionado of mermaids. When Michael offered him a opportunity to participate in the development of new maritime law for the International Marine Mammal Institute, Leonard Simon had jumped at the chance. Michael hadn\u0026rsquo;t told him of all the details of the new institute, but Leonard had happily liquidated his holdings and signed onto the project on the hint that mermaids might actually exist. Next to him was Peter LaMond, a retired chemist with hundreds of patents to his name who had come to Hong Kong to live out his life in luxury near the sea. When Michael had explained that it might be possible to live his life in the sea, and that he might recover some measure of his youthfulness as well, Peter had signed on. Finally, there was Elizabeth (Liz) Wainwright, who was an old family friend of Michael\u0026rsquo;s. Liz had helped him raise his children, had been a great friend when his wife had passed away, and was happily the heiress to a large fortune, which was now designated to support the MMI. Liz had also suffered a stroke a few years ago, and had lost the use of most of her left side. Michael had explained that she might have a real hope for healing at the MMI, and that she should come with him.\nIt was going to be a good pod, he hoped, but Len and Peter were the wild cards. Peter he wasn\u0026rsquo;t worried about because he was older and not physically large enough to pose much of a threat to Michael\u0026rsquo;s own dominance. Len, on the other hand, was only in his forties, and he was not a slender man, though Michael might actually have the benefit of being in better physical shape. Nevertheless, Michael hoped that when it came time, Len would opt willingly to become a mermaid.\nMichael thought back over the last several weeks. After he had assembled the list of equipment for the mers Joy had requested, he immediately started the transfer of his business to his sons, Brian and Brendon. The boys, well, men actually, were overjoyed that their father had finally decided to let them run the business. They were a bit mystified by some of the provisions of the transfer, but Michael had allayed their fears with a transfer of a majority of the stock into their names. Then he got another radio call from the mers, asking for his leadership in a rescue operation that would lead to his joining their community if he desired. He desired. He then assembled his crew, and now was only a few days from Davao. He would get a radio call from a mer named Mark, and then further plans would be laid. One of Joy\u0026rsquo;s contacts would hopefully arrange for the people they were going to rescue from Malaki\u0026rsquo;s organization to be at the brothel from which the rich despots (i.e., Michael and Len) would \u0026ldquo;buy\u0026rdquo; these women for their own pleasure, which would actually be the rescue. Hopefully, all the pieces to the puzzle would fall into place.\nOr so he prayed.\n\u0026ldquo;Danni\u0026rsquo;s back watching all the children,\u0026rdquo; Pat said as she bobbed in the water directly below Hank and Janice. \u0026ldquo;MuSu, Mark, and Wong\u0026rsquo;s pods are off on a rescue mission, but everyone else should be out here ready to help.\u0026rdquo;\nHank looked out at the growing group of mers as they surrounded his boat, his eyes scanning the seventeen bobbing heads as each mer surfaced. Suddenly, he caught sight of a heartbreakingly beautiful mermaid who looked like a delightful combination of the girl he had nearly bowled over twenty years ago and a young, Elizabeth Taylor. Rose \u0026hellip; his son. His heart pounded in both fear and anticipation, and he couldn\u0026rsquo;t decide if he was happy for Rose or sorry for himself.\n\u0026ldquo;Dad!\u0026rdquo; the beautiful creature shouted and pulled Trevor behind her as she swam for the boat, her long, feminine body undulating along the surface of the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Janice,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, tapping his wife on her shoulder, pointing in the direction of their new daughter.\n\u0026ldquo;Rose!\u0026rdquo; Janice said as she waved vigorously at her newest but eldest daughter. \u0026ldquo;You look spectacular.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I look like you,\u0026rdquo; Rose said laughing as she drew closer.\n\u0026ldquo;You look like Elizabeth Taylor,\u0026rdquo; Janice joked.\n\u0026ldquo;So do you,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, pulling his wife into a hug and kiss. \u0026ldquo;Actually, you are even prettier than Elizabeth Taylor ever was.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right answer,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, her eyes shinning.\n\u0026ldquo;Can we \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Ann started.\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; Hank interrupted. \u0026ldquo;We need all hands to unload all this equipment.\u0026rdquo; He looked at his two youngest daughters and saw the disappointment and longing etched in their eyes. \u0026ldquo;Alright, a quick hello and then back into the boat to help with the equipment. You two will have \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; he started as Kate and Ann both leap over the railing and dove into the water. \u0026ldquo;Plenty of time later,\u0026rdquo; he finished as they both sliced into the sea. He watched for a moment as his twins swam for Trevor, showering him with kisses, as Rose waited her turn.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, Hank!\u0026rdquo; Pat shouted from just below the boat. \u0026ldquo;How are we going to do this?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Carefully,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, turning his attention to something he could control. \u0026ldquo;The equipment is very delicate, and each case is only modestly water proof. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to have each one submerged for any longer than necessary.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you lower one over the side so we can get a feel for how difficult each one will be to move in the water?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Hank answered, indicating to Janice, Brian, and Julie that they should get started. \u0026ldquo;Do you want me to get your sister, she\u0026rsquo;s below?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is she alright?\u0026rdquo; John asked as he appeared beside Pat.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Hank answered. \u0026ldquo;As far as I can tell. She just wanted to look her best for her new sister, I believe.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I finally understand that impulse,\u0026rdquo; Pat joked, moving some of her hair from her face and arranging it around her shoulders.\nHank smiled, took another look where Trevor, Rose, Ann, and Kate were floating together, talking animatedly as the twins poked and prodded both Trevor and Rose, admiring their new tails, beautiful eyes, and long, thick hair. He turned down the hatch and walked down the passageway towards one of the staterooms in which they had packed the new equipment for the lab. He stopped at an open door and poked his head into the room.\n\u0026ldquo;Your sister awaits you,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be right up,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said, turning to Elise, lifting a questioning eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll be fine,\u0026rdquo; Elise said. \u0026ldquo;You look beautiful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You only say that because you love me,\u0026rdquo; Bridget fussed.\n\u0026ldquo;None of us are as beautiful as the mermaids,\u0026rdquo; Elise reminded her. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s quite silly to think that we should compare two middle-aged lesbians to a fistful of mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Bridget worried. \u0026ldquo;But a girl can try.\u0026rdquo;\nIt had taken them the rest of the afternoon to unload the Freedom III as the boat rocked in the sea along the western face of the volcano. Waterproof boxes that were filled with all kinds of unusual equipment, chemical supplies, and satellite communications equipment were lowered one, by one, into the water where waiting mers would take them down into the growing network of caves, tunnels, and passageways. As soon as they were done here, the crew, minus Ann and Kate, would sail the boat back over to the lagoon where some final equipment for the satellite uplink and some other supplies for Harold Matthews would be unloaded.\nOver the last few months, the mers had doubled the size of their underwater home, and now it had nearly all the comforts of civilization. Fuel cells powered electrical equipment in dozens of rooms, solar panels hidden along the mountain provided additional power for the larger equipment, like their new MRI and DNA sequencing machines. Among the many improvements they made was that the only viable entrance to the complex was through the main tunnel that led to the Moon Pool, which had been slowly expanded in an effort not to disturb the delicate ecology of plants, bacteria, micro-organisms, and flora and fauna that had transformed the Moon Pool into a change agent. There were still hundreds of small vents, fissures, and cracks that allowed water and air to circulate throughout the vast complex, but the mers had inspected all of them to make sure that no human could enter their caves through any other opening.\n\u0026ldquo;O.K.,\u0026rdquo; Hank said as he handed down a long, thin, waterproof box to Tuo and Sandi. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the last one for the caves. The rest goes to the lagoon. We\u0026rsquo;ll wait for Trevor to get back before we go, thanks Dawn.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sandi,\u0026rdquo; Tuo corrected with a smile at his sister wife.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, sorry,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, embarrassed. \u0026ldquo;Right, I keep forgetting that you are \u0026hellip; now \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;A mermaid?\u0026rdquo; Sandi asked, smiling up at her former boss as he seemed to get lost staring at her face, shoulders, and breasts as she bobbed in the water. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, after you become a mer, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to tell us apart.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, yes,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. He struggled for a moment, wanting to ask a question, but he shook his head and nearly ran into his daughter as she emerged from below. \u0026ldquo;Oh, sorry, Kate.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No problem, Dad,\u0026rdquo; she answered, looking down at Sandi and Tuo. \u0026ldquo;Hi Sandi, at least my Dad can still tell Ann and I apart.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about after tonight?\u0026rdquo; Sandi asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re done?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked, brushing her long blond hair away from her face. \u0026ldquo;Tonight? OMG!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You O.K.?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked as she emerged next to her sister, noting her panicked expression.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re gross,\u0026rdquo; Kate complained, indicating how hot and sweaty they both were. \u0026ldquo;And we\u0026rsquo;re about to be with Trevor and Rose for the first time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re both beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Sandi reassured them. \u0026ldquo;Trevor and Rose have been talking about today for months. Hank, we\u0026rsquo;ll take this one into the caves and then met you over in the lagoon, alright?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, yea, sure,\u0026rdquo; Hank answered, looking at his daughters.\n\u0026ldquo;No more virgins!\u0026rdquo; Ann said smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s enough of that,\u0026rdquo; Hank said awkwardly. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t need to give me any more details, I\u0026rsquo;m still your father, after all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Dad,\u0026rdquo; Ann sighed theatrically. \u0026ldquo;You know all about mer sexuality; what\u0026rsquo;s the big deal?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll deal with it when I\u0026rsquo;m a mer,\u0026rdquo; he answered. \u0026ldquo;Now, go get your mother from below, and say goodbye.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Goodbye?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked. \u0026ldquo;You guys aren\u0026rsquo;t coming?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Hank explained. \u0026ldquo;First, your mother and I and Aunt Julie and Uncle Brian will be helping Harold Matthews for a few days. We have to set up the new uplink and upgrade some of the electrical systems for the naval gun. Jim and his girls will stay with us on the beach tonight, and transition tomorrow. Second, if we enter the Moon Pool with you, we might start transitioning which would make helping Harold very difficult. Third, tonight is just for you and your new pod, I thought you knew that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;I just thought we\u0026rsquo;d all do it at once.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re actually going to be an experiment,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, emerging from below.\n\u0026ldquo;What kind of experiment?\u0026rdquo; asked Ann.\n\u0026ldquo;It will just be the four of you in the Moon Pool,\u0026rdquo; Janice explained. \u0026ldquo;Rose invented those new tiara\u0026rsquo;s, and Pat and the others believe that your transitions will be very quick and accurate if you are wearing the tiara when you enter the Moon Pool. That\u0026rsquo;s where Trevor and Rose went just a minute ago, to get your tiara\u0026rsquo;s.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean we are going to be mermaids tonight?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked breathlessly.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, if you\u0026rsquo;re up for it,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;No one will force you to do anything you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t wait! This is great!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Kate asked, waving her hand over her body. \u0026ldquo;You know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If sex is better as a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Ann said, putting her hands on her hips and facing her \u0026ldquo;younger\u0026rdquo; sister. \u0026ldquo;Then there is no reason to have sex as a human first, is there?\u0026rdquo; She turned to her father. \u0026ldquo;Dad, get over it.\u0026rdquo;\nHank coughed into his hand and looked away, but Janice gave her daughters a smile. \u0026ldquo;I think the bigger issue is that Trevor is no longer human sized, and you might get hurt if you tried to make love with him while you\u0026rsquo;re still human. I think Ann\u0026rsquo;s right, there is nothing to be sentimental about here. We all know what becoming a mermaid means, right Hank?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, er, of course,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, looking uncomfortable. Damn Janice \u0026hellip; she was doing it to him again. \u0026ldquo;So, come here and give me a hug, and when we see you tomorrow, you\u0026rsquo;ll be a mermaid. Your mother and I will join you in a few days.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As mermaids?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked conspiratorially.\n\u0026ldquo;Um, er,\u0026rdquo; Hank stuttered.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, putting her hand on Hank\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. \u0026ldquo;Would that be alright with you girls?\u0026rdquo;\nBoth girls shared a look, and Kate looked smug. \u0026ldquo;We love you, Daddy, no matter what.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Kate? Ann?\u0026rdquo; a voice rose from the sea next to the boat. \u0026ldquo;You two ready?\u0026rdquo;\nThe girls rushed to the railing and looked down at two of the most beautiful creatures they had ever seen. Trevor and Rose bobbed in the sea, their tails each flashing red beneath the surface of the water. Rose\u0026rsquo;s tiara sparkled as it sat perched in her rich dark hair, which cascaded down into the water and floated around her shoulders, allowing glimpses of her generous breasts as they rose and fell. Trevor\u0026rsquo;s shorter blond hair was tucked behind his less ornate headband, the multicolored silver flashing in the late afternoon sun. Each of them held a tiara in the air that matched Rose\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, they\u0026rsquo;re beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Kate gushed.\n\u0026ldquo;So are you two,\u0026rdquo; Trevor answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Get naked and get down here,\u0026rdquo; Rose ordered smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;Naked?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked, glancing at her father.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not going to want clothes again,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;Clothes irritate your gills.\u0026rdquo;\nHank turned away and waved his hand. \u0026ldquo;Go on, they\u0026rsquo;re waiting for you. We\u0026rsquo;ll see you tomorrow in the lagoon.\u0026rdquo;\nThe girls both shrugged and loosened their bikini tops, allowing their small B sized breasts to bounce free of the skimpy material. Then, they both reached down and unsnapped their shorts, allowing them to fall to the ground as well. Then, holding hands, they both stepped up to the railing, and plunged into the warm sea, naked as newborn babies.\n\u0026ldquo;Have you two had enough time to talk it over?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, as she sat down for lunch in the exclusive café where they had agreed to meet Brent and Annette after they had had time to digest their proposal.\n\u0026ldquo;We agree that it would be both in our country\u0026rsquo;s interest and in our personal interest to form a pod,\u0026rdquo; Brent answered. \u0026ldquo;We only have to decide on who we will invite to join ours.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, the plan is for the four of us to form a pod,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, looking carefully and Brent and Mac. \u0026ldquo;One of you two as a mermaid will give the mermaids a military strategist/leader of their own, especially if the men are operating as a unit, as they must for safety.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about you?\u0026rdquo; Brent asked. \u0026ldquo;You are just as strategically smart as either Mac or I, and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be better if we were in two different pods anyway, spreading the wealth so to speak?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought that mer-learning insures some level of shared knowledge that makes your argument obsolete,\u0026rdquo; Mac argued.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, but \u0026hellip; as both of you know,\u0026rdquo; Joy said patiently. \u0026ldquo;No amount of learning, book or mer, can replace experience and judgment. You two have that in spades. Further, our pod is to become the tip of the spear; that\u0026rsquo;s our role. Along with Mark\u0026rsquo;s pod, who have shown a remarkable knack for such work, Homa in particular, we will be the first line of defense for Mermaid Island. And both of you know that we can be more effective, because we are a relatively small force, if we are largely self-sufficient.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Brent began.\n\u0026ldquo;Finally,\u0026rdquo; Joy continued. \u0026ldquo;Mer-connections would allow us excellent command and control, especially if we disperse to cover more territory. With two mermaids embedded in two other pods, and then our one merman with one other mermaid, we four can exert a unified command over three pods, and if Mark\u0026rsquo;s pod similarly divides, then we have five pods, which is a platoon.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve given this a lot of thought,\u0026rdquo; Mac commented.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s my job,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I know it makes you uncomfortable, but Annette can confirm that which ever of you makes the transition, you won\u0026rsquo;t have lost anything in terms of strategic, military effectiveness if you become a female.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I would agree,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, nodding. \u0026ldquo;There are things that I could do because I was a woman, but to be fair, there were things I could not do as well. But it\u0026rsquo;s not my decision to make. You and Mac are the ones who are old friends. I\u0026rsquo;ve only known Joy for the last few days, though the more I come to know her, the happier I am to be her future pod-mate. Think of it, Brent, a whole new life, a new purpose, and the youth, strength, and energy to fulfill the mission, and I could finally have a child!\u0026rdquo;\nJoy, Mac, and Brent turned to look at Annette, her face practically glowing.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s a possibility, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo; She demanded. \u0026ldquo;Brent and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have kids, but now we could.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That depends on who becomes the other mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Brent said darkly.\nRose gently snuggled the tiara into Kate\u0026rsquo;s hair, brushing a wet strand away from her face as she tread water in the open sea.\n\u0026ldquo;Why does your hair look so good?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked. \u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t stay plastered to your face.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because it\u0026rsquo;s hydrophobic,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;And soon yours will be too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Kate said nodding as she felt the delicate metal headpiece press lightly into her temples. \u0026ldquo;I forgot about that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said as he positioned a matching tiara onto Ann\u0026rsquo;s head. \u0026ldquo;Mer-learning helps us remember more than I thought possible, even from mers that we aren\u0026rsquo;t bonded to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;God, you\u0026rsquo;re so beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Ann said to Trevor, as she held onto his broad strong shoulders, letting him keep both of them afloat. \u0026ldquo;Your eyes are just amazing,\u0026rdquo; she said as she traced her fingers along his handsome face, running her fingers over his eyebrows. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re even better looking now than when Kate and I were twelve.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You two have improved dramatically since then as well,\u0026rdquo; Trevor laughed. \u0026ldquo;But now, I\u0026rsquo;m really glad that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to pick between you two.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Two?\u0026rdquo; Rose said, arching an eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;Three!\u0026rdquo; Trevor agreed. \u0026ldquo;I get all three of you. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be luckier!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Luckier than MuSu?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean by that?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked.\n\u0026ldquo;He has triplets,\u0026rdquo; Ann explained. \u0026ldquo;Kate worries that twins aren\u0026rsquo;t good enough.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We could be triplets,\u0026rdquo; Kate said, glancing at Rose. \u0026ldquo;If that\u0026rsquo;s what you like.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; Trevor and Rose said together. Kate and Ann looked at Rose with surprise.\n\u0026ldquo;No, you should be yourselves,\u0026rdquo; Rose argued. \u0026ldquo;Both Trevor and I have been waiting for you two for a very long time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s hard to explain,\u0026rdquo; Trevor began. \u0026ldquo;Well, I \u0026hellip; I have always, well, I have always loved \u0026hellip; both of you. Seriously. It was hell and heaven at the same time. So, when your brother transitioned into Rose, part of the changes that happened because of my influences over him was that Rose developed a longing for you two, just the way you are, the way I have always remembered you—the way that I have always wanted you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I dreamed that you had the same crush on me that I had on you,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;Now, I know that you did,\u0026rdquo; she said as she kissed him deeply for the first time.\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly,\u0026rdquo; Rose said as she drew Kate into a full body embrace and kiss.\nKate felt her new sister\u0026rsquo;s tongue push into her mouth, and allowed her body to be supported in the water by her mermaid-sister. She could feel Rose\u0026rsquo;s tail as it gently pushed back and forth, keeping them balanced as Rose\u0026rsquo;s swim bladder kept them afloat. Every now and again, Kate could feel Rose\u0026rsquo;s black mid-tail fins brushing against her ankles. Mermaids were long, Kate thought to herself, and soon she would have a tail of her own. She felt her own breasts press into Rose\u0026rsquo;s larger ones, and she wondered what it would feel like to have such beautiful, full, breasts. Rose\u0026rsquo;s nipples were much larger than her own, and they poked her own tender flesh in a very exciting way. Kate thrust her own tongue into Rose\u0026rsquo;s mouth, and hugged her sister fiercely. Rose moaned into the kiss as Kate\u0026rsquo;s hands pressed into her sensitive gills.\n\u0026ldquo;We have waited so long,\u0026rdquo; Rose said as she broke the kiss with her sister. \u0026ldquo;And we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to wait a few moments longer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked, pouting theatrically. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t want me to be your sister-wife?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Three things need to happen in a very short period of time,\u0026rdquo; Rose explained. \u0026ldquo;First, we have your \u0026ldquo;first feeding\u0026rdquo; in some canteens near the cave entrance, and that will help you develop the proto mer-organs that are at the heart of not only this experiment but also everything that the mers have become. Second,\u0026rdquo; she continued, lifting a second finger with her other hand, \u0026ldquo;you will need to allow enough time for the siren cell to be established in your bodies so that the Moon Pool itself is not the only change agent; we don\u0026rsquo;t want you turning into an eel or something else.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Kate agreed. \u0026ldquo;I want to be a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you will,\u0026rdquo; Rose answered reassuringly. \u0026ldquo;Finally, you need to wait until Pat has told us that the sensors and instruments are ready to record your transformations.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, let\u0026rsquo;s get to the canteens,\u0026rdquo; Ann urged, feeling her body press against only a portion of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s long body, wishing that she could twirl her own tail around his, and that she had the mer-organs to accommodate his merman\u0026rsquo;s penis within her new body. She satisfied herself by wrapping her legs around his waist, and pressing her naked body to his still closed vent. The feelings that rocketed through her body surprised her, and Ann felt the pressure of an orgasm begin to build in her stomach.\n\u0026ldquo;Easy, now\u0026rdquo; Trevor advised. \u0026ldquo;Save some for later.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There will be plenty for later,\u0026rdquo; Ann heaved, humping his scales, feeling her mons press against his unnaturally smooth, nano-textured skin covering his hips. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve waited for six years for this moment.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Me too,\u0026rdquo; Trevor agreed. \u0026ldquo;There was always something about the two of you, and Robbie was never my type.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And now?\u0026rdquo; Rose challenged.\n\u0026ldquo;Rose, you know how much I love you,\u0026rdquo; Trevor admonished. \u0026ldquo;So, why do you even question it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A girl needs some reassurance,\u0026rdquo; Rose countered, looking to Kate for some support.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Kate admitted. \u0026ldquo;We do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I just wish that we could make love right now,\u0026rdquo; Ann growled, feeling her sexual appetite gnaw within her like a hungry dog. \u0026ldquo;You know that we\u0026rsquo;ve been saving ourselves for you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought as much,\u0026rdquo; Trevor admitted. \u0026ldquo;You two were always so sweet and sexy, but never slutty. I\u0026rsquo;m glad it\u0026rsquo;s worked out this way. I really do love you girls,\u0026rdquo; he finished looking around at all three.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you could make love to him now, but it would be hard,\u0026rdquo; Rose said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Mom said that Trevor would be too big,\u0026rdquo; Kate agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;No, that\u0026rsquo;s not the problem,\u0026rdquo; Rose countered. \u0026ldquo;The problem is that you don\u0026rsquo;t have gills, and we would have to keep your heads in the air.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Trevor could fit?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked. \u0026ldquo;OMG! He could not!\u0026rdquo; she said as she felt Trevor\u0026rsquo;s nearly eleven-inch penis emerge from his vent, poking between her knees. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s huge.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;And it\u0026rsquo;s wonderful. But, he\u0026rsquo;s still a lot smaller than a human child, and what goes out \u0026hellip; can go in, but it takes a lot of work. Having the siren cells in your body makes it even easier. Ragi and Timi were able to make love to Bill when they were still human, but they had just changed from men into women, and their bodies were filled with siren cells.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The real problem is the air,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said, enjoying the feeling of Ann\u0026rsquo;s soft legs rubbing against his stiff cock. \u0026ldquo;We can kiss,\u0026rdquo; he said, putting action with words, leaving Ann breathless. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m just above your knees, and I would have to raise myself up, keep you afloat, and do a proper job of making love to you, which is possible, but not very romantic.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sort of like making love in a sports car after prom,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; she demanded as everyone looked at her. \u0026ldquo;Me and Evelyn Walker, my senior year.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I knew it!\u0026rdquo; Kate said.\n\u0026ldquo;It was awkward, difficult, and unsatisfying,\u0026rdquo; Rose concluded. \u0026ldquo;Out here, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to hide from anyone, and the ocean is one, gigantic water bed for us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We could go to the Transition Cave,\u0026rdquo; Trevor added. \u0026ldquo;Which has a very soft, sandy floor, but we would have to pass through the Moon Pool to get there, and that would ruin the experiment.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Besides,\u0026rdquo; Rose added. \u0026ldquo;Sex really is better as a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get started,\u0026rdquo; Ann said, her chest heaving. \u0026ldquo;Where are those canteens?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;John, can you hand me that cable?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked as she rearranged several of the pieces of equipment that had just been unloaded from the Freedom III.\nJohn handed her the cable from under the table where he had slithered his long body, keeping track of the many wires that snaked from one box to another. Around the lab cave other mers worked feverishly preparing equipment, running tests, darting from computer screens to the pool so they could communicate with their pod-mates who were in the Moon Pool and other parts of the complex re-attaching connections, re-adjusting sensors, and generally running around doing the bidding of Pat, Phoebe, Galina, Alexis, Sally, and Eric. Bill and Tuo\u0026rsquo;s pods were in the lagoon with Harold helping unload the last of the equipment from the boat, and Liga was watching all their baby mermaids in the lab pool, and served as their primary CHEW channel operator.\n\u0026ldquo;Liga, ask Danni to swim by node 77 again,\u0026rdquo; Pat asked as she finished connecting the table.\nLiga ducked under the water and relayed the message, while Pat and Phoebe watched one of the computer screens intently. Liga popped back up with a squirming Freya in her arms.\n\u0026ldquo;When ever I send a CHEW to a mother, their daughter wants to follow the signal,\u0026rdquo; Liga complained.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll try to figure that one out after we finish with the Connor twins,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said without lifting her eyes from the computer.\n\u0026ldquo;And \u0026hellip; third pass,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, nodding with satisfaction. \u0026ldquo;Tell Danni to high-tail it back here. Galina, how are you doing?\u0026rdquo;\nGalina raised her head from a tangled mound of wire, computers, boxes, and gauges on the far side of the lab. \u0026ldquo;Two minutes, hopefully. Liga, can you ask Petra to release again?\u0026rdquo;\nLiga ducked under again, (Danni, Pat said the sensor on the main tunnel is working now, so come back, and catch your daughter on your way back here, I\u0026rsquo;m letting her go.)\n(Thanks, Liga,) Danni replied. (I\u0026rsquo;ll be right there.)\nLiga released the squirming Freya and hunted down Michelle and gathered her up into her arms. (Petra, can you and Xing release more mermaid milk into the pool?)\n(Yes,) came the reply back.\nLiga resurfaced and surveyed the lab while she waited for her next message, Michelle squirming in her arms. Tiny LED\u0026rsquo;s were strung throughout the ceiling and walls of the cave, casting an even glow of cool, blue-white light everywhere. The cave had been expanded both outward and upward, and the pool was now tiered, with a wide shallow shelf that led to a ramp so heavier equipment could be rolled in and out of the water. Sally and Eric hunched over an impressive video system that now showed several views from cameras mounted at the bottom of the Moon Pool, one from each of the cardinal compass points around the middle of the pool, and one from the cave above the surface of the water. Alexis had curled her pink tail under her table where she watched a variety of computer screens that showed a cascade of numbers and graphs that twitched and moved as the data stream from a variety of sensors was tabulated and merged into graphical information. Pat and Phoebe both sat an consoles that had wires that ran from their tiara\u0026rsquo;s to a small box that blocked any out going signals from the mermaids, but allowed them to monitor the changes in CHEW that they hoped their new computers would be able to map and record.\n\u0026ldquo;Emma would be jealous,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe mused as she looked out over all the new equipment.\n\u0026ldquo;Emma couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less,\u0026rdquo; Pat countered. \u0026ldquo;She is going to rescue her mother. I think that will fully engage her attention.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I just meant that she would have wanted to play with some of these new toys,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m also just worried about her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;ll be fine,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, turning around to re-adjust the settings for the data capture. \u0026ldquo;MuSu is perhaps the most skilled martial arts fighter of anyone, and Mark is an experienced leader.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And Homa will destroy any one or any thing that even looks cross-eyed at her new family,\u0026rdquo; John joked as he slid out from under the table. \u0026ldquo;That girl\u0026rsquo;s eyes are pure danger.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ready,\u0026rdquo; Galina reported from behind her station.\n\u0026ldquo;Liga?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\nLiga ducked back under the water as Danni rose past her, carrying Freya, Cynthia, and Maureen in her arms. (Alright everyone, we\u0026rsquo;re ready,) Liga sent out. (Petra, Xing, Gabriel, come on back. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to corral Michelle and Bao on your way. Trevor and Rose, we\u0026rsquo;re ready when you are.)\n\u0026ldquo;Rose, Kate, Ann, they\u0026rsquo;re ready,\u0026rdquo; Trevor reported as he resurfaced next to Rose, who was floating on her back, her breasts lolling in the gentle motion of the waves. \u0026ldquo;How are you two doing?\u0026rdquo; he asked, looking up along the rocks behind his head.\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Kate reported from her perch on a rocky shelf on the cliffs that rose from the sea above the entrance to the main tunnel. \u0026ldquo;My back itches,\u0026rdquo; she continued as she turned around, showing the patches of red and pink that ran down either side of her spine from her shoulder blades to just above her pelvis.\n\u0026ldquo;Mine too,\u0026rdquo; Ann said as she clambered along the shelf to get closer to her sister. \u0026ldquo;How long have we been out here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Time, eh?\u0026rdquo; Rose teased. \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about time out here; no watches,\u0026rdquo; she finished waving her empty wrists in the air.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d say only a few hours,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said. \u0026ldquo;You two warm enough?\u0026rdquo; he asked, looking out at the setting sun.\n\u0026ldquo;The rocks hold the heat for a long time,\u0026rdquo; Ann answered. \u0026ldquo;What now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Move over,\u0026rdquo; Rose said as she let her tail sink and returned to a vertical orientation. She waved her hands at Ann, indicating that she should create a space between herself and her twin. When there was enough room, Rose twisted away from the cliff, swam a quick circle underwater, and smoothly rose from the water and landed with a soft, plop, between her two sisters. \u0026ldquo;Normally, there is a small ceremony that we have done in the Moon Pool, but because we are doing this particular experiment, we\u0026rsquo;re going to do it here. You both realize what you\u0026rsquo;re about to do?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; they both answered.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you desire?\u0026rdquo; Rose asked, looking back and forth at each one of them.\n\u0026ldquo;I want to be like you,\u0026rdquo; Kate said, her eyes shinning.\n\u0026ldquo;I want a tail,\u0026rdquo; Ann said, her slender body quivering with excitement.\n\u0026ldquo;Then drink from me, and take your tails,\u0026rdquo; Rose said as she arched her back and thrust her breasts out towards the setting sun, holding her arms out, ready to embrace her sisters.\nBoth girls looked at Rose\u0026rsquo;s beautiful breasts in awe, conscious of the power hidden within the pink flesh, the light traces of blue veins visible beneath the smooth skin. Ann could see that Rose\u0026rsquo;s nipple was already oozing milk in preparation for this task. She turned on her hip, rested one elbow on Rose\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fin, and lowered her mouth to the large nipple. She felt her sister\u0026rsquo;s hand support her head as she moved to her breast, and as the nipple brushed past her lips, Ann closed her mouth over the slight dome of Rose\u0026rsquo;s areola. The milk that gushed into her mouth tasted sweet and clean, unlike the slightly salty milk they drank from the canteens several hours ago. She could also feel her sister\u0026rsquo;s head brush against her own as they both fed from Rose. For many long minutes, they drank together while Rose hummed softly above them.\n\u0026ldquo;That was beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Kate said as she pulled away from Rose\u0026rsquo;s breast. \u0026ldquo;That tasted so much better than before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s because the canteens were mixed,\u0026rdquo; Rose said as she savored the wonderful feelings that ran through her body in the wake of feeding her sisters.\n\u0026ldquo;Mixed with all the mermaids?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked as she lifted her own head reluctantly from Rose\u0026rsquo;s breast.\n\u0026ldquo;Mixed with all the mers,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said, as he propped himself up on a low, wide rock that was half in and half out of the water, his long cock already emerging from his vent. \u0026ldquo;Are you ready for me?\u0026rdquo;\nAnn looked down and understood both what had been mixed in the canteens and what her next step must be. Rose pushed herself off the shelf and dove gracefully back down into the water below. Ann scooted across the rocky shelf, swung around her sister, and then began to clamber down the rocks towards Trevor. \u0026ldquo;Come on, Kate,\u0026rdquo; she urged. \u0026ldquo;If we share, it will go quicker.\u0026rdquo;\nBoth girls scrambled down to where Trevor reclined on the rock, one on each side of him. Kate stared at the long shaft that throbbed with Trevor\u0026rsquo;s blood and warmth, while Ann reached out and ran her fingers along the length of his thick cock, nearly as thick has her own arm.\n\u0026ldquo;Trevor, will you give us our tails?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Drink from me, and receive your tails,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said as he lay back and let his cock fully rise, pointing stiffly into the sky.\nBoth girls leaned down and kissed the head of his penis, tasting both the salt of the sea and Trevor\u0026rsquo;s own musk. Together they worked their way, kissing and licking down to the base of his cock, where his black and red vent now pulsed with blood. Trevor groaned, \u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t take long, be careful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He will have six or seven spurts,\u0026rdquo; Rose warned, remembering her own transition, \u0026ldquo;right from the start, so pass it back and forth quickly.\u0026rdquo;\nAnn nodded, and moved quickly to the top of his cock, looked her sister in the eye, and then sucked as much of him into her mouth as she could. Trevor immediately erupted with a massive spurt that splashed down Ann\u0026rsquo;s throat. She nearly gagged, but lifted her head and pushed his stiff cock towards Kate. Kate nearly bumped her head against Ann\u0026rsquo;s as she caught the start of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s next spurt on her chin, but quickly stuffed the head in her mouth. A third squirt erupted down her throat, nearly choking her, and she passed Trevor\u0026rsquo;s magnificent organ back to Ann. Ann got in two quick strokes with her mouth before Trevor erupted a forth time, groaning with passion as each spasm tore through his lower abdomen and tail. His volume was going down, but it was still considerable. Ann gave him another stroke and took his fifth spurt before passing him back to Kate. Kate devoured him, and bobbed both her head and her hands as she coaxed a sixth and then a seventh and final spurt from the now delirious Trevor, his tail was quivering like an eggbeater in the water, frothing the surface of the water as his body shook from the power of his orgasm. Together, the twins kissed and licked Trevor\u0026rsquo;s slowly softening cock as he twitched and moaned beneath them. Finally, he was still.\n\u0026ldquo;How do you feel?\u0026rdquo; Rose asked from the water where she could barely contain herself, watching the incredible sexuality that oozed from her pod-mate and sisters.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhhh, great,\u0026rdquo; Trevor sighed.\n\u0026ldquo;I wasn\u0026rsquo;t asking you, silly,\u0026rdquo; Rose giggled.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; Kate said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Ann agreed. \u0026ldquo;I can feel your milk and his cum moving through my body. It feels so, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, powerful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re definitely ready,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said as he sat up, looking at the twin\u0026rsquo;s backs. \u0026ldquo;I can see gill fronds.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The tiara\u0026rsquo;s work,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re transitioning much quicker.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What kind of tails do you want girls?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked, patting them on their naked butts with a gentle caress.\n\u0026ldquo;Irish Green with gold highlights along the fins and flukes that match yours,\u0026rdquo; Ann said as Kate nodded, looking at Trevor\u0026rsquo;s powerful red and black striped tail with its nearly metallic gold coloring along his fins, flukes, and dorsal fins.\n\u0026ldquo;Great, let\u0026rsquo;s get going,\u0026rdquo; he said as he pushed them gently into the water. \u0026ldquo;If you feel the need to breathe as we pull you through the tunnel, just kiss us. Rose, you take Kate?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Rose said as she reached for her sister. \u0026ldquo;Green and gold it will be.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They passed the first sensors,\u0026rdquo; Galina reported. \u0026ldquo;Are you registering two or four?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Two primaries,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported. \u0026ldquo;And two secondary\u0026rsquo;s. The proto-mer organs in Kate and Ann register, but just barely.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s happening for you?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked over her shoulder where Eric and Sally monitored the video equipment.\n\u0026ldquo;All systems normal,\u0026rdquo; Sally reported. \u0026ldquo;Have a clear and steady picture and clean audio.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alexis?\u0026rdquo; Pat continued.\n\u0026ldquo;All biologics are up, cycles are steady,\u0026rdquo; she reported, her pink and white flukes twitching along the floor with anticipation.\n\u0026ldquo;Here we go,\u0026rdquo; Pat said softly, watching her computer screens as the sensors tracked the movements of the four individuals as they made their way steadily down the main tunnel.\nThe tunnel glowed with a soft, bluish green light, the strands of seaweed stretching across the rocks like holiday lights. Kate let her self be pulled along by Rose\u0026rsquo;s steady strokes, her body undulating with hers as she pushed them both down the long, wide, tunnel. She was holding her breath, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any pressure in her lungs, and she hoped that her gills were working. She didn\u0026rsquo;t want to slow them down by taking time for a breath from Rose. She turned her head and saw Ann and Trevor as they moved down the passageway next to her. Trevor\u0026rsquo;s longish hair flowing over his shoulders and half-way down his back as Ann\u0026rsquo;s relatively shorter blonde hair fluttered in the water. Ann smiled at her and gave her the thumbs up, which Kate returned.\nKate could sense the water getting brighter, and then suddenly they emerged into the center of the Moon Pool. The dim light of the evening sky above barely visible through the chimney opening high over head, its feeble light nearly overwhelmed by the illumination from the plants within the pool. Rose released her and gave her a look. She thought she could feel a tingling along her tiara, but it quickly disappeared.\n\u0026ldquo;You need to breathe?\u0026rdquo; Rose asked out loud, since Kate couldn\u0026rsquo;t hear her CHEW yet.\nShe shook her head, not willing to let any air out and risk having to rise to the surface. She smiled and nodded, feeling the warm water of the Moon Pool caress her body. Next to her, Ann rose in the water.\n\u0026ldquo;We are going to be right here,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said. \u0026ldquo;Just below you. Concentrate on your tails, and try to feel the thoughts we are sending to you,\u0026rdquo; he finished, tapping his headband.\nBoth mers sank so that their heads were even with the girls' knees, and together they began to hum.\nBack in the lab, the sensors indicated a sharp rise in activity, and the lab grew quiet as everyone watched their instruments, while Petra, Xing, and Gabriel watched Sally\u0026rsquo;s video. The pool began to glow as the billions of micro-organisms sensed Kate and Ann in their midst. Alexis' and Galina\u0026rsquo;s instruments began to show staggering amounts of activity, the tiny creatures building up energy and momentum in only a few minutes.\nIn the Moon Pool, Kate relaxed as she felt Rose\u0026rsquo;s hands begin to stroke her legs, feeling the warmth of Rose\u0026rsquo;s milk and Trevor\u0026rsquo;s cum spread from her belly into her body. As the pool began to get brighter, she began to feel a tension in her legs, and she stretched them down towards the bottom of the pool. She could see Ann do the same, and she felt Rose turn her body so that she and Ann faced one another. Below them, Rose and Trevor continued to hum and stroke their legs. Slowly, she felt her skin begin to tingle, as if thousands of tiny hairs were brushing up against her, and the tingling grew inward, warming her muscles and making her belly jump, as though she had been tickled. In her crotch, she could feel a tingling grow from within her, and she tried to open herself up to the pool, to her pod-mates, to her sister who hung in the water across from her.\nThe water seemed to grow denser, heavier, as though it was pressing in on her, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t feel panicked. Her legs grew even stiffer as she felt her body begin to be controlled by the forces both within her and within the pool itself. Her arms raised out from her sides as her spine became erect, and she could see Ann\u0026rsquo;s body assume a similar position. The water around her caressed her, seeming to her like a giant, velvet hand. She could still feel Rose\u0026rsquo;s hands on her legs, but just barely. The sensations from within her body were beginning to overwhelm those from without.\n\u0026ldquo;Mark one,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said as the first micro-burst flashed across her sensors.\n\u0026ldquo;Copy,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, punching a button on her own console.\n\u0026ldquo;We are at four primaries,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported. \u0026ldquo;Our top mer-organs appear to be our CHEW organs. Kate and Ann show only eight centimeters of bioelectrical organs at the top of their pelvic bone, whereas Rose and Trevor both read above 35 centimeters, most of which extend into the tail.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Copy,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\nKate looked at Ann, and saw that the walls of the pool were moving. No, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t right, she thought, barely able to concentrate as the feelings of power building within her body rose higher and higher. They were moving, very slowly, but they were spinning around, each anchored to an invisible compass point halfway between them. She saw that Rose and Trevor had backed away, and were watching them from a few meters away. Both appeared to be humming, but Kate could hardly hear them over the sound of millions of tiny \u0026ldquo;ploinks\u0026rdquo; that surrounded her as bubbles began to rise all around her. Soon, she could barely see Ann, but her body was now being caressed by millions of tiny bubbles that seemed to burst from her own skin and then rise to the surface above.\nShe felt a great urge to push, and she bore down with her abdominals and leg muscles. She could feel that the nerves that signaled that one leg was touching another had disappeared, and she knew that her legs had fused. It was happening! Great waves of sensations rolled in and out of her body as the bubbles grew in intensity, and she could sense for the first time the growing connection between her and Trevor and Rose. She pushed again, feeling a great pleasure spasm through her lower torso, better than any orgasm when she had masturbated, and felt her hip bones expand slightly outward as her body assumed a more dramatically feminine shape. Her hair also brushed against her ass for the first time, and she knew that her hair was becoming hydrophobic, just like Rose\u0026rsquo;s. The bubbles were a blizzard around her, and now she could only see glimpse\u0026rsquo;s of Ann, but she could feel her twin more strongly with each passing moment, and she could sense that Ann was changing in time with herself.\n\u0026ldquo;Mer-organs complete,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported.\n\u0026ldquo;This is incredible,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s happening?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked sharply.\n\u0026ldquo;The energy the micro-organisms are creating is off the charts,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;Where are they getting all that energy?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to figure out,\u0026rdquo; Pat reminded her. \u0026ldquo;Galina?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t get clear readings on anything other than skeletal, but we still do not have union at mid or lower tail as yet, but pelvic shifts are complete and proto-fins are visible,\u0026rdquo; she reported.\n\u0026ldquo;Video?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Not going to be very useful, I\u0026rsquo;m afraid,\u0026rdquo; Sally reported. \u0026ldquo;Too many bubbles, but it sure is pretty.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Their CHEW is off the charts,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported. \u0026ldquo;It must look like the forth of July in there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the forth of July?\u0026rdquo; asked Galina.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s kidding,\u0026rdquo; Pat said as Phoebe started to answer. \u0026ldquo;Pay attention to your monitors.\u0026rdquo;\nTrevor and Rose watched in awe as tendrils of green, gold, and red began to snake from their own bodies into the swirling maelstrom of bubbles in the center of the pool. It did indeed look like the finale of a fireworks display. They kept concentrating on the twin\u0026rsquo;s new tails, and kept up their soft humming.\nKate could feel her thighs snap as her femurs formed two new joints in between the now three separate bones, the pain was sharp but was quickly overwhelmed by the siren cells that had multiplied in her body. She could also feel her breasts grow heavier as they expanded away from her chest. Her nipples felt stiff and wonderful as millions of bubbles caressed her slowly growing breasts. That pleasure was offset, however, as a new bone fused her knees together, and her calves felt empty and achy as the siren cells harvested her fibulas for use in her new bones, fins, and flukes. She could feel her tibias break into six different pieces, and that seemed to hurt more than her hips or thighs. That discomfort quickly passed as she felt her ankles fuse together as her toes began to lengthen. Her tail \u0026hellip; she was growing her own tail. The bubbles still surrounded her, and she couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell which direction she faced. She could tell when she passed Trevor and Rose because she could now \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; them clearly with her mer senses.\nShe felt a new sensation along her skin as the texture and color of her skin began to change, shifting towards a brilliant green along her tail, rising from her newly formed flukes up to her wider hips, which now sported pelvic fins that were tinged in gold. She felt her dorsal ridge rise along the back of her tail, making her mer senses clearer and stronger, and she could feel a great wave of energy rise from her lower back and spread outwards through her whole body, making her fins, flukes, hands, and hair tingle as it left. She was aware of fins along her elbows and hips and knees, and her flukes were now wide and strong, and she could feel the water flowing over her fringes.\n\u0026ldquo;Merdocrine system complete,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported, her sensors indicating that the delicate web of filaments that connected to their mer-organs had spread throughout Kate and Ann\u0026rsquo;s bodies.\n\u0026ldquo;Organics at peak activity,\u0026rdquo; Alexis reported. \u0026ldquo;And 70% drop, mark.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Transition complete, mark,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\nThe bubbles seemed to just disappear, and Kate felt her body gripped with an intense spasm, causing her tail to arc back up over her head. As her eyes finally focused, she could see that she was eye to eye with Ann, and that their tails were nearly touching, each of them quivering with pleasure as the final throes of their transformation coursed through their bodies. They both relaxed, their long tails sinking below their torso\u0026rsquo;s, as they each looked the other over.\nThey were still twins, their blonde hair seemed more golden and reached down to the top of their iridescent, green tails, and their blue eyes were now bright, cerulean jewels of sparking light. Their bodies were now the more mature shapes of mermaids, their wide hips supporting gold tinged pelvic fins, their long slender, green tails flashing with inner lights as they hung in the dim light of the Moon Pool. Kate saw that Ann\u0026rsquo;s breasts looked slightly larger, and looked down to see her own identical breasts, now tipped with mature nipples that were stiff with anticipation.\nKate looked over at Trevor, and saw the same desire reflected in his eyes. She glanced at Rose and saw the exact same passion, and was surprised herself at the easy and guilt free feeling of desire that washed over her as she devoured the beauty of her former brother and now sister wife. She saw Rose\u0026rsquo;s eyes flicker over to Ann, and Kate turned back towards her sister. She pushed herself with her fins towards her sister, wrapped her arms around her as she gathered her into a kiss. Kate felt her own breasts push into Ann\u0026rsquo;s and marveled at the fullness she felt. Her lips met Ann\u0026rsquo;s and they kissed deeply, their bodies melding into one another\u0026rsquo;s. She sensed Trevor and Rose and they moved to the center of the pool, joining them.\n\u0026ldquo;Who goes first?\u0026rdquo; Ann asked as she pulled away from the fin-curling kiss she had shared with her sister wife.\n\u0026ldquo;You,\u0026rdquo; Kate breathed. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re older.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;By one minute,\u0026rdquo; Ann said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;Thanks, sis. I love you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll pay me back sometime,\u0026rdquo; Kate answered with a wry smile.\n\u0026ldquo;You won\u0026rsquo;t miss anything,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, reaching out to caress Kate\u0026rsquo;s face. \u0026ldquo;There is a reason why there are three mermaids to each merman. Watch and learn.\u0026rdquo;\nRose maneuvered Kate to the other side of Trevor as he reached out for Ann. As Ann shared her first kiss with Trevor as a mermaid, Rose positioned herself over Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fin, and pressed her vent into him. Kate quickly caught on, and wiggled her hips until Trevor\u0026rsquo;s other fin was lodged firmly between her own, swollen but still virginal lips. As Trevor\u0026rsquo;s penis re-emerged from his vent, Kate savored the wonderful feelings of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s fin vibrating along her newly formed vent.\nAnn looked down between her larger breasts and studied Trevor\u0026rsquo;s cock that was pointed right at her. She felt her womb spasm in anticipation even as a stab of fear quickened her heartbeat. She looked up into Trevor\u0026rsquo;s equally bright, but more ultramarine blue eyes, noting that they were darker than Kate\u0026rsquo;s and her own lighter blue eyes. They were still the most beautiful blue eyes she had ever seen, and she could feel her body respond to his gaze. It felt like her upper tailbones (her former thighs) bowed outward in an echo of spreading her legs, and her pelvic bones rocked forward, opening her vent towards the stiff monster that pointed directly at her womb.\n\u0026ldquo;Ann,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said softly, touching her lips, cheeks, and eyes with reverence. \u0026ldquo;Finally.\u0026rdquo; He pulled her to him, and kissed her deeply again, stroking her hair and the top of her green tail, tickling her golden dorsal fringes.\nAnn savored the feeling of closeness, Trevor\u0026rsquo;s cock trapped between their bodies, Kate on her left, holding onto her left arm, and Rose on her right, stroking her elbow fin, which felt wonderful. Her tongue twisted into Trevor\u0026rsquo;s mouth as she pressed her body and tail into his. She could feel her breasts swell, filling with milk that she knew that she would release for the first time with her first orgasm as a mermaid. The gentle pressure behind her enlarged nipples was deliciously agonizing as they pressed into Trevor\u0026rsquo;s strong, hairless chest.\nShe broke off the kiss, and shyly reached down to his cock, and guided it to her throbbing entrance. His cock head felt cool against her hot skin, and she could feel her juices flow into the water around his cock. She twisted her tail around his and put both arms around his neck. She watched his face as she slowly pressed herself onto her long-time fantasy. His cock felt huge as it slowly stretched her open, and she worried briefly that she would not be able to accommodate him. He read her emotions, even though she wasn\u0026rsquo;t using her CHEW, and took her face with both his hands.\n(Don\u0026rsquo;t worry,) he sent to her. (You\u0026rsquo;ll be fine.)\n(Trust me,) Rose added, her own eyes beginning to flutter as she watched her sister prepare to lose her virginity. (It will fit. Just press hard and get it over with.)\n(My own brother,) Ann sent over her CHEW for the first time. (Who would have thought?)\n(Sister,) Rose corrected. (Now and forever more.)\nAnn smiled at her beautiful, dark haired sister wife, feeling the tension of only having the tip of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s cock vibrating in her vagina. Rose was nearing orgasm, her eyes were half lidded, and her breasts were already leaking milk into the water, despite the fact that she and Kate had drained her dry a very short time ago. She returned her gaze to Trevor, and she pulled her lower lip into her teeth, and tightened her tail around his. Then, she gathered her courage and pressed forward with all her might, burying her face in his neck.\nThere was a slight hitch, and then he was all the way in. Ann froze, letting the brief sharp pain ebb from her body, feeling her hips pressed to his, her breasts against his chest, and her face nuzzling his shoulder and neck. As the pain quickly faded, it was replaced with a fullness that grew in pleasure until she could no longer keep her hips still. She lifted her head, and kissed Trevor fiercely and began to move her hips back and forth. She could feel each ripple of flesh within her as his thick cock stroked against the sides of her no-longervirginal vaginal canal. Her pleasure built quickly, and she could see thousands of tendrils of energy burst from her body, reaching into Kate, Rose, and Trevor. Kate\u0026rsquo;s body was emanating new tendrils of green and gold too, and as Ann looked down to watch Trevor\u0026rsquo;s cock disappear within her own flesh, she could see that all four of their tails were now filled with wild, chaotic lights and flickered and glowed across the surfaces of their tails, fins, and flukes.\nTrevor reached down to her hips and began to help Ann with her strokes, and she could feel her insides start to tighten up, and the tickle of an enormous orgasm began to build in her belly. She felt her own flukes quiver uncontrollably, and she was barely conscious of how quickly the four of them were beginning to spin. All she could feel was Trevor\u0026rsquo;s cock slamming back and forth and the intensity of her CHEW connections to Rose and Kate growing with her rising orgasm. She felt Kate\u0026rsquo;s warm milk caress her right arm as her new sister wife approached her first mermaid orgasm, her moans of pleasure filling Ann\u0026rsquo;s ears while her body bumped and nudged Ann\u0026rsquo;s as she shook and twitched.\nKate tried to fight back her orgasm, wanting to time it with Ann\u0026rsquo;s, but she was fighting a losing battle. Her breasts were already spraying milk into the water, and the feeling of her own milk rushing from her swollen nipples propelled her even closer to the looming precipice of a massive orgasm. It felt both like a relief and a release, her nipples tingling as though each stream of milk was caused by a tiny electric current. She looked across Trevor and Ann and watched as Rose fought back her own orgasm, her body swaying in time with the powerful thrusts Trevor was delivering to Ann. Kate tried to hold back, but Trevor\u0026rsquo;s fin was buzzing at exactly the right frequency, and Kate felt her new, larger womb begin to spasm, each one building on the last, until her entire torso shook with each wave of pleasure. She didn\u0026rsquo;t even know that she was screaming.\nAnn could feel Kate lose herself in her orgasm, and felt a corresponding wave of pressure build in her own abdomen. Before she could savor her attempt to control her own body, Ann felt an enormous wave blossom within her that slammed through her with a force she never expected. Her entire body clamped down on Trevor\u0026rsquo;s cock, and her tail tightened its grip on his. Her breasts spurting multiple streams of mermaid milk from her shaking breasts as she grunted and thrust herself against Trevor, her body convulsing with great waves of pleasure. Rose finally joined them, shaking and screaming as all three mermaids spouted milk into the water, obscuring them from the cameras that were still rolling. Just as Ann thought her body was returning to her own control, Trevor held her hips tight to his own, and pulsed his seed into her body, his long cock rippling with each spurt as it passed through him. Ann\u0026rsquo;s womb responded to the hot splash of semen within her by squeezing down on his pulsing cock in a tremendous spasm that caused her to bite down on Trevor\u0026rsquo;s shoulder as she rocketed into another, even longer orgasm, her cries joining those of her two sisters.\nNo one was still watching them, however. Not that Ann, Kate, Rose or Trevor cared one way or the other. But three pods were tangled together in the small pool in the lab, their new equipment left to record what ever data Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pod was still generating on its own with no mer supervision.\nTo be continued.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/changes-in-paradise13/","tags":["mermaids","transgender","transformation"],"title":"Changes in Paradise: Part 13 – MAD-mers, CHEW, and Poly-mers"},{"categories":["Mermaids"],"contents":"The epic tail (pun) of Mermaid Island continues. The mer scientists unlock the secret of the microorganisms, Abao attacks, Hank Connor and his crew transition to mers, Joy and Mac face uncertainties, and we learn more about the nature of mer-life.\nThe cave was deep inside the single dormant volcano jutting up from the ocean along the western edge of a small island that lay at the intersection of 3 degrees, 23 minutes, and 51 seconds south, and 174 degrees, 40 minutes and 52 seconds west. The small island was largely overlooked by the world, being without adequate land area for an airport, even a small one. It was also a privately owned island, though few people in the world knew either the current owners or the agreements that caused the previous owners to sell their land.\nThe cave was originally formed by a pocket of hot gas, along with many of the other caves riddling the western interior of the volcano. This one, however, had been altered by the current occupants to suit their needs. A soft white-blue glow from LEDs strung up like holiday lights filled the room, which made visible a line between the natural, gasformed, cave walls and the more recent, acid etched walls. The floor, however, was uniformly smooth, polished clean by the near constant brush of mer-tails. The surprisingly airy cave was twenty meters wide and thirty meters deep and was filled with long, low tables, each about one meter high that were ordered in a five by six rectangular grid, each table about three meters from any other. Two tables nearest to the small pool filling one corner of the room were empty; the rest were piled high with computers and strange looking scientific apparatus. Several large pieces of equipment hulked along the back wall, including an MRI machine, a CAT scanner, and an isolation chamber.\nIt looked like a perfect place for a mad scientist.\nPat rubbed her green eyes, blinked, then pulled her long sea green tail up behind her and scratched her dorsal ridge, briskly vibrating one corner of her pink-fringed-flukes against the center of her back. As she satisfied her itch, she leaned back into the steam-punk looking apparatus set on the table before her, gently placing her chin on its padded rest. Her dark, red hair fell forward as she concentrated, shielding her eyes from the lights above, her long tail curled back out behind her, nearly hitting the table where two other mermaids were hunched over a computer screen.\n\u0026ldquo;Watch the tail,\u0026rdquo; Galina warned without looking up.\nPhoebe stifled a giggle, Pat lifting her head sharply and staring daggers at her pod-mate.\n\u0026ldquo;It wasn\u0026rsquo;t Phoebe who broke that last vial,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, winking at white-blond Nordic mermaid.\nPat looked from Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s laughing blue eyes down to her sister wife\u0026rsquo;s long blue tail with its white fringes matching her hair, noting that it rested on the leg of Galina\u0026rsquo;s and Alexis' table. She arched an eyebrow at her pod-mate and then turned all the way around to look at her own tail, and despite the teasing she had just endured, she admired, yet again, how beautiful it was. It shimmered in the soft LEDs, her wide flukes curling and twitching as she flexed her \u0026ldquo;old toes,\u0026rdquo; which were now long, thin bones, making her flukes so flexible and strong. Her tail was nearly a meter longer than her legs had been, and was a brilliant wash of color reaching from the middle of her hips to the light pink fringes lining the trailing edge of her flukes.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; she said playfully, buoyed by the sight of her own tail. \u0026ldquo;I keep forgetting how long this thing actually is.\u0026rdquo;\nShe turned back to her steam-punk microscope, forcing her tired eyes to look through the small lens. There, in the tiny eyepieces, she watched hundreds of tiny, squiggling, spiraling, and squirming microorganisms come into focus. She could feel Phoebe shift over to her right side to prepare their next slide. The four of them had been working steadily for several hours through the dark of the night, returning to work shortly after the orgy that followed Kate and Ann\u0026rsquo;s transition, poring through the mountain of data they had collected.\nShe watched again, as the microscopic creatures absorbed the mineral salts, which Phoebe had dyed blue, into their bodies then began to disaggregate them. She watched amazed, until realizing she wasn\u0026rsquo;t breathing and leaned back with a sigh.\nIncredible, she thought to herself rubbing her tired eyes again. The microorganisms in the Moon Pool were literally creating the raw materials they had used during their transition from human to mer. The siren cells could, and had, done it on their own, but it had taken weeks to build up enough mass and energy to accomplish the task. The microorganisms' activity accounted for both the increased speed of the more recent transformations and the otherwise unexplainable increases in everyone\u0026rsquo;s body mass and density. The microorganisms may have been a significant factor in their unbelievable luck in achieving the genetic stability they enjoyed. Well, she reminded herself, they now knew how much their bio-electro-magnetic mer-organs affected the transformations, which was considerable.\n\u0026ldquo;Next,\u0026rdquo; she said, flexing her tail, trying to work out the stiffness she felt as she propped herself up before the microscope. Phoebe removed the current slide and replaced it with another. Pat leaned back into the powerful apparatus and looked again. After a few minutes she began to dictate.\n\u0026ldquo;They are processing and breaking down minerals and salts in the water,\u0026rdquo; Pat reported as Phoebe typed notes into her computer. \u0026ldquo;They disaggregate inorganic compounds into elements and, as a byproduct, gain materials for their own reproduction. Additional waste products are organic compounds that our siren cells use to rebuild tissue and bone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They breed while creating the raw materials for our transformations?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe confirmed while typing furiously.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;It looks to be both a bio-chemical and an electromagnetic process, much like Rose does when she creates polymers. Galina, what does your data suggest?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A few of these microorganisms are converting mass into energy on a quantum scale, a process which seems to follow fractal patterns,\u0026rdquo; Galina reported, her voice tinged with awe. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s similar to how our cells follow DNA instructions, which-like any fractal—are repeating patterns resonating across a structure. But these conversions are happening on a scale too small for our equipment to measure, and their energy traces seem to suggest a dual process, and perhaps that second one causes our non-genetic expressions, like hydrophobic skin and hair.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Possible,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;But we can\u0026rsquo;t see them, and I would bet that even Geneva\u0026rsquo;s accelerator can\u0026rsquo;t see them either. So, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to know the answer to that question for a while.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe the second process is not quantum, but rather an unusual biological process we can\u0026rsquo;t see?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;d see otherwise unexplainable biological waste,\u0026rdquo; Galina argued. \u0026ldquo;No biological system is completely efficient. Even though we have very efficient biological systems as mermaids, we do not use all our calories for cellular survival.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It means we still poop,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;I know what that means,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said with a pout.\n\u0026ldquo;And the processes don\u0026rsquo;t seem to operate like biological agents,\u0026rdquo; Alexis observed. \u0026ldquo;They aren\u0026rsquo;t bacteria, or they aren\u0026rsquo;t any longer at any rate, AND they aren\u0026rsquo;t viruses. They appear to be acting very differently. Perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s a radical mutation of bacteria.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mutation?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, salamandering over Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s tail and circling around the table to their computer.\n\u0026ldquo;The residual radioactivity on this island has created instabilities in the DNA of some creatures,\u0026rdquo; Alexis offered. \u0026ldquo;We may have been affected by this phenomenon ourselves, except in a good way. We were created by a rare combination of bio-electromagnetic forces in both our human and siren DNA. Our resultant DNA is unusually stable, thus our long life expectancy, but these micro-organisms are highly unstable.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about those DNA packets inside those micro-organisms?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, pointing at the computer screen.\n\u0026ldquo;Those viral packets?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked.\nPat nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a match,\u0026rdquo; Galina said.\n\u0026ldquo;How much?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, feeling her tail cramp beneath her.\n\u0026ldquo;Um, give me a minute,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, twisting to another computer to her right. Her long, graceful fingers flew over the keyboard, typing furiously.\n\u0026ldquo;We should work on an interface between our tiara\u0026rsquo;s and computers,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, watching her former fellow Russian scientist work. \u0026ldquo;We could really speed some things up.\u0026rdquo;\nGalina\u0026rsquo;s hands were a blur over the keyboard, and after several minutes of entering data and activating complex computations, she straightened up.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s actually unbelievable,\u0026rdquo; Galina reported.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you kidding?\u0026rdquo; Pat sighed. \u0026ldquo;After all we\u0026rsquo;ve been through already, you think you\u0026rsquo;ve discovered something unbelievable? A compound I distilled from painted shellfish changes me into a girl, then Danni,\u0026rdquo; she said nodding at the pool where the rest of the mers were still sleeping, \u0026ldquo;then it changed all of us into mermaids, including two stranded Russian men. Now, you tell me we\u0026rsquo;ve found something incredible?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The micro-organisms that carry this particular virus comprise at least fifty different species,\u0026rdquo; Galina reported, lifting her head from the computer screen, her bright red hair falling back from her face, curling over her very large breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;We confirmed that last week,\u0026rdquo; Alexis added, her blue eyes sparkling with excitement.\n\u0026ldquo;And they each perform very specific and very different activities during transformation,\u0026rdquo; Galina continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Which we also knew last week,\u0026rdquo; Pat reminded her.\n\u0026ldquo;But, what we didn\u0026rsquo;t know is that they all carry the exact same, identical virus,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, her hand sweeping over the data on the other computer screen. \u0026ldquo;Which is itself an exact match for our siren cells.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Exact?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, salamandering over Alexis' bright pink tail and sidling next to Galina\u0026rsquo;s dark maroon one.\n\u0026ldquo;Exact,\u0026rdquo; Galina reported, pointing to her computer screen.\n\u0026ldquo;I believe you,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, peering at the columns of glowing numbers. \u0026ldquo;I just don\u0026rsquo;t believe the data. Over three billion possible, and probable, variations, and there are no variations.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is exact?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Exact,\u0026rdquo; Galina repeated in the same tone.\n\u0026ldquo;Exact?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked.\n\u0026ldquo;That was three times, it\u0026rsquo;s not funny any more,\u0026rdquo; Pat sighed. \u0026ldquo;So, it\u0026rsquo;s exact. The micro-organisms carry the DNA for siren cells in a viral form.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Does that mean that they can actually make them,\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked. \u0026ldquo;Like we do in our own bodies?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I would think so, but only after they are inserted into human cells,\u0026rdquo; Galina argued. \u0026ldquo;Remember those nasty little bugs we created for the Rous sarcoma virus a few years ago?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t remind me,\u0026rdquo; Alexis protested. \u0026ldquo;They almost killed us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, these lipid packets are morphologically identical,\u0026rdquo; Galina observed. \u0026ldquo;Except that now the result is a siren cell rather than a deadly cancer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or so we hope,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, a sudden inspiration taking her. \u0026ldquo;These microbes are performing both biological and electrochemical changes in materials around them as they infect living material in order to breed, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Basically,\u0026rdquo; Galina agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Can we leverage those functions towards purely electrochemical ones and have the biological ones create the energy?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You mean, use the biological energies that are now waste driven to power more electrochemical disaggregation?\u0026rdquo; Alexis asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my goodness,\u0026rdquo; Galina agreed. \u0026ldquo;Maybe. We could, but what would we do with that process?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Disaggregate sea water,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;We could do it,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, her dark blue eyes suddenly growing bright with fear.\n\u0026ldquo;Do what?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked, looking around the dim lab cave to see if everyone else was still asleep in the pool at the far end of the cavern.\n\u0026ldquo;Create a bio-electrical organism that can metabolize or disaggregate base molecules into elements, which would cause them procreate at exponential speeds,\u0026rdquo; Galina answered. \u0026ldquo;We could turn seawater into a gas.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, god,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;Could we?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;While it\u0026rsquo;s theoretically possible,\u0026rdquo; Galina said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure if it is desirable.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We must,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said. \u0026ldquo;We cannot allow what we have created to be lost. I lost two pod-mates once to human greed and ignorance. I have no wish to lose another. We must do this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But these micro-organisms are inside Mac and Joy,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;If they are so unstable, what are we going to do for them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said softly. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;\nJohn awoke slowly, his eyes blinking through the thick cloud of golden blond hair blocking his view. As he struggled to focus past the swirling mass of hair, he became aware of his long penis, still hard, and still buried in a mermaid. Blond hair \u0026hellip; long, stiff nipples pressed into his chest \u0026hellip; a soft, fluttery tail quivered along his own \u0026hellip; it must be Danni he concluded, still feeling groggy.\nHe closed his unhelpful eyes and let the sensual brush of Danni\u0026rsquo;s soft fringes along the trailing edge of her flukes wash over his tail, his own flukes and pelvic fins beginning to quiver with passion. He felt his CHEW focus on Danni\u0026rsquo;s, and hers grew brighter as she stirred towards wakefulness. His long penis twitched within Danni\u0026rsquo;s warm womb, and she stirred, nuzzling her face into his neck.\n\u0026ldquo;Ummmm,\u0026rdquo; she moaned, out loud. [You\u0026rsquo;re still inside me. I love waking up like this,] she sent to him via their CHEW.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhhhh,\u0026rdquo; he agreed, out loud.\n[I sometimes wish I was always last,] she thought to him softly.\nJohn jerked his head up and stole a quick look around, worried that Pat and Phoebe were still in the water, able to hear Danni\u0026rsquo;s CHEW. He halfconsciously knew they had left the small pool filling one corner of the Lab Cave, but he wanted to make sure. He sensed his three daughters behind him, cuddled together with Petra\u0026rsquo;s daughter Michelle, Xing\u0026rsquo;s daughter Bao, and Liga\u0026rsquo;s daughter Mair. The six infant mermaids were curled in a small ball in the very center of the pool. He noticed that Alexis had left Eric, Sally, and Liga behind, and that Galina was missing from Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s pod. He smiled to himself; the four scientists were back at work, before anyone else had stirred, and two of them were his pod-mates.\nThe mermaid-scientists had collected a lot of data the previous evening when Kate and Ann transitioned into mermaids. Watching the data scroll down the computer screens had been amazing, seeing each step of the transformation represented in graphic shifts and jumps in the numbers as they raced by. He wondered what time it was, and he lifted his head to search for the pinhole of light from just above the cave entrance that would indicate that the sun had risen, but no spark of light was visible. The lights from the lab softly glowed, but it was still dark outside. He could barely sense Phoebe and Pat, hovering with Galina and Alexis over a computer along the back wall. They would not be able to sense Danni\u0026rsquo;s words.\n[At least you get me to yourself when there\u0026rsquo;s science to be done,] remarked John. [Pat and Phoebe are already back at work.]\n[Do you think they discovered anything new last night?] Danni asked as she began to move slightly against John\u0026rsquo;s hips, forcing his penis to wag back and forth within her.\n\u0026ldquo;Uuuuaaaahhhh,\u0026rdquo; John sighed out loud, responding to Danni\u0026rsquo;s movements. [I think it might still be last night; I can\u0026rsquo;t yet see the morning sun in the peephole. One thing that we did learn was that the compulsion to mate after transformation travels at least as far as the distance between the Moon Pool and the Lab cave. God, that was overwhelming!]\n[Overwhelming?] Danni asked, beginning to move her hips along the length of John\u0026rsquo;s cock, her breathing quickening.\n[It just caught \u0026hellip; ahhh \u0026hellip; me by surprise because we weren\u0026rsquo;t officially \u0026ldquo;in\u0026rdquo; on the transition,] he explained. [I didn\u0026rsquo;t think it would affect \u0026hellip; ahhh \u0026hellip; us since we weren\u0026rsquo;t in the pool with them.]\n[Yeah,] she agreed. [I can\u0026rsquo;t \u0026hellip; ummmm \u0026hellip; believe that Ann\u0026rsquo;s and Kate\u0026rsquo;s pheromones \u0026hellip; oohhh \u0026hellip; traveled that far, that fast. God, you feel so good inside me,] Danni mentally sighed. She closed her eyes, savoring the thick fullness that John\u0026rsquo;s long cock created in her belly. She could feel their tails twisted together, her flukes resting just at the joint between tail and fluke on John, and she ran her fingers along the transitional line between his nearly translucent flukes and his denser knob at the base of his tail. John shivered as she stroked him.\n[Actually, Pat\u0026rsquo;s early hypothesis just before we tumbled into this pool \u0026hellip; yes \u0026hellip; to join you was that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t pheromones because our children weren\u0026rsquo;t yet affected. They only started getting sleepy after \u0026hellip; ahhh \u0026hellip; after we started. Pat thought it was our CHEW, and so I guess our CHEW is more complicated than anyone guessed,] John said, as he stroked Danni\u0026rsquo;s long hair away from her face. [Not only are pods bound to one another, but all mers are some how connected with each other.]\nDanni wrapped her tail more tightly around John\u0026rsquo;s and pressed herself tightly into her mate, her generous breasts pressed up and out as she ground herself into his darkly shimmering tail, the faint flickering of their bioluminescence now visible. [I love being connected with you,] she said as she nipped and kissed at his chin.\n[What\u0026rsquo;s gotten into you?] John teased.\n\u0026ldquo;You! You\u0026rsquo;ve gotten into me,\u0026rdquo; Danni mused out loud as she pressed herself into her mate. [Mermaids get horny all the time, even when it\u0026rsquo;s not transformation.]\n[Right,] John said, remembering. [Like when you girls watched Phoebe with Petra and Esme with Trixi; you all got uncontrollably horny despite the fact that there was no transformation.]\n[But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t like the transformations; it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a compulsion,] Danni noted as she starting moving her hips with more vigor, savoring the feeling of John\u0026rsquo;s thick penis head moving against her G-spot. [It was more \u0026hellip; ahhhhh \u0026hellip; like this.]\n[What is this,] asked John, grabbing her pelvic fins and helping her move back and forth along his stiff cock.\n[This is just regular, I love you, horny,] she gasped as her breasts began to leak milk into the water and her abdomen started twitching.\n[I love regular, I love you, horny,] John agreed as Danni thrashed out a morning orgasm, clutching at his cock as her womb spasmed around him. He waited until she stopped shaking, and then leveraged his own tail against hers and started to stroke strongly in and out of her.\n[There is nothing regular about the way you make me feel,] Danni groaned, feeling her body begin another journey towards a second orgasm.\nJohn smiled, wrapped his long tail one more loop around hers, and began to go faster.\nRose hung onto Tutu as the young female dolphin propelled them both through the water, not nearly as fast as Rose could go by her self, but that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the point. They were playing. With MuSu and the Henderson triplets gone on the rescue mission, Snort\u0026rsquo;s pod had attached themselves to the next best thing: Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pod. Tutu twisted up towards the surface, and Rose matched the dolphin\u0026rsquo;s strokes, adding to their combined speed and power. Together, they burst from the water, turning in the air, both of them squealing with delight. Rose slapped her black and red flukes on Tutu\u0026rsquo;s gray and white ones, pushing them apart so they fell back into the water separately. They both executed another flip, Rose\u0026rsquo;s long, dark hair brushing Tutu as they turned past one another just before hitting the water.\nTwo deep and rich \u0026ldquo;kerthwoumps\u0026rdquo; resonated in the water while two perfect geysers whooshed up towards the morning sky. Rose giggled with childish satisfaction as she tumbled under the water. She had never been able to do a can-opener dive quite like that back when she was a little boy, she thought to herself. She righted herself in the water, and swam back for the surface.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s only a 5.1,\u0026rdquo; Kate said sagely.\n\u0026ldquo;Only a 5.1?\u0026rdquo; Rose protested. \u0026ldquo;Are you kidding? That was nearly perfect!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought it was beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;Tutu especially,\u0026rdquo; she said as the latter surfaced and squirted water at her face. \u0026ldquo;Such a good girl!\u0026rdquo; Ann gushed, rubbing the dolphin\u0026rsquo;s proffered nose.\n\u0026ldquo;Tutu gets a 5.9,\u0026rdquo; Kate said.\n\u0026ldquo;Tutu?\u0026rdquo; Rose protested. \u0026ldquo;Why do you always have to be the Russian judge?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because I\u0026rsquo;m the youngest, and you\u0026rsquo;re the oldest,\u0026rdquo; Kate answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Trevor?\u0026rdquo; Rose whined.\n\u0026ldquo;6.0,\u0026rdquo; He said, calmly, one arm draped over Snort, who also looked on without much interest.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha!\u0026rdquo; Rose said.\n\u0026ldquo;Whatever,\u0026rdquo; Kate said. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;ll say anything to get laid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He always gets laid,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s three to one, the lucky bastard.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you feeling neglected?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked, a note of seriousness creeping into his voice.\n\u0026ldquo;No, no,\u0026rdquo; Ann said. \u0026ldquo;I was just pointing out to the young child here that you were giving an honest opinion as to Rose\u0026rsquo;s skill.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I was,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;It was not a 6.0,\u0026rdquo; Kate argued. \u0026ldquo;She didn\u0026rsquo;t get further than two meters out of the water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s see what you\u0026rsquo;ve got,\u0026rdquo; Rose challenged.\n\u0026ldquo;Fine,\u0026rdquo; Kate smiled, and then whistled with her fingers and lips.\n\u0026ldquo;I could never do that,\u0026rdquo; Rose complained, trying again to master that essential childhood skill. She blew through her fingers at all kinds of angles, with no luck.\nMumu rolled up beside Kate, waving a flipper at her newest friend. Kate reached over, gently held Mumu\u0026rsquo;s dorsal fin and drifted onto her back as they both swam away from the pod. Kate loved the feeling of her new body slicing through the water. There was so much that was new, so much that was wonderful. The warmth of Mumu\u0026rsquo;s body undulating next to hers, the feeling of her hair fluttering along her shoulders and back, the way her fins cut through the water, creating eddies of sensation along the sides of her tail, and the incredible feeling of power she got from her wide flukes whenever she pushed against the water with them.\nShe kicked a strong stroke, sending both her and Mumu towards the bottom, the dolphin understanding the trick they were to perform. As they plunged downwards, Kate noticed how her larger breasts had tightened up on her chest, offering less resistance to the water. She pushed harder with her tail, urging Mumu to go faster, feeling her pelvic fins leverage each stroke of her flukes like a fulcrum. She was aware of her elbow fins constantly adjusting the flow of water, guiding both her and the dolphin along a straight trajectory. She pulled herself closer to Mumu\u0026rsquo;s back, and together they twisted towards the surface. Kate reversed her grip on Mumu\u0026rsquo;s dorsal fin, pulling the dolphin rather than being pulled by her. She added more power to her strokes, and pushed them both towards the surface.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; Rose said without envy as she watched her sister-wife and their pet explode from the water.\nKate pushed Mumu\u0026rsquo;s dorsal fin to her left, causing her to spin in the opposite direction, and then—as they twisted past each other—she curled her longer tail under the dolphin\u0026rsquo;s flukes, lifting Mumu higher and starting each of them on a flip away from one another. Kate\u0026rsquo;s timing sent both of them spinning madly, once, twice, three, four times around, nearly out of control, and then \u0026ldquo;Ka-thawap!\u0026rdquo; The water shattered away from her as she smacked the surface with the full length of her body.\nOuch, Kate thought, that stung.\n\u0026ldquo;Uh-oh,\u0026rdquo; Rose said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, that will leave a mark,\u0026rdquo; Ann said, trying not to giggle.\nKate turned her now tingling body towards the surface, but let herself sink for a bit, watching the sun play on the surface of the water. How could something so pretty hurt so much, she thought. She noticed a slightly disoriented Mumu being tended to by Snort, who had rushed to her side. She wished Trevor had the sense to see if she was O.K.\n[Hey, you O.K.?] Trevor asked, appearing as if by magic at her side, startling her.\n[Mostly,] she answered after she composed herself.\n[Good,] he said, looking her over carefully, using his CHEW to see beyond the surface of things. [It looks like the only thing you hurt was your pride.]\n[That\u0026rsquo;s what you think,] she said. [That belly-flop hurt.]\n[Everyone does it at least once,] Trevor said encouragingly. [It actually takes a while to really get used to your new tail. I mean, you\u0026rsquo;re doing great, but super fine motor skills only come with practice. Come on, you can\u0026rsquo;t hide down here forever. Let\u0026rsquo;s get back to Rose and Ann.]\n[How did you sneak up on me?] she asked as they both headed for the surface.\n[Finely tuned motor skills,] he answered.\n[Don\u0026rsquo;t believe him,] Rose said, her face back in the water as she listened to their CHEW. [Just like anything else, our CHEW can get rattled if we strain it or our bodies. You were just a bit scrambled. I\u0026rsquo;m glad you didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt yourself.]\nKate\u0026rsquo;s head broke the surface and the sun seemed a little bright. She blinked several times and slowly everyone came into focus.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;That was intense!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but it was only a 3.7,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;You lost massive points on the re-entry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My eyes hurt,\u0026rdquo; Kate complained.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get you out of the sun,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, her mothering instincts coming out.\nThe entire pod slowly sank, floating down until they were about five meters below the surface. The water was still bright, but the intensity of the sun was gone. Kate closed her eyes and let her pod surround her.\n[I\u0026rsquo;m sorry,] she sighed.\n[Don\u0026rsquo;t even worry about it,] Ann said. [You saved me from making a complete and utter fool out of myself.]\n[Well, that\u0026rsquo;s something good,] Kate said, blinking her eyes, trying to shake it off.\n[Let\u0026rsquo;s try this,] Rose said as she floated up a bit, positioning her breast in front of Kate\u0026rsquo;s face. [Can\u0026rsquo;t hurt, right.]\nKate looked at the large, beautiful breast before her, the one that had helped propel her towards mermaid hood the previous day. Rose\u0026rsquo;s nipple was already leaking a bit of milk in anticipation of feeding her sister, and Kate was suddenly buoyed by this sign of her sister-wife\u0026rsquo;s care for her. She leaned forward and took the nipple in her mouth.\nRose closed her eyes as the now familiar and sensuous feelings of feeding emanated from her breast. She gathered Kate\u0026rsquo;s long blond hair into her hands and pressed Kate\u0026rsquo;s head to her chest. She felt her milk release, that wonderful rush when her glands let down, and milk began to spray from her other nipple.\n[Can\u0026rsquo;t hurt, right?] Ann said as she moved to Rose\u0026rsquo;s other breast and began to suckle.\nKate literally felt her head clearing, while suckling on her sisterwife' s breast. Each gush of warm, sweet milk washed away a bit more of the fog, gently easing the feelings of tightness along her belly and tail. She could feel her sister Ann\u0026rsquo;s tail brush against her own as they both fed from Rose. Then she felt something that surprised her. She felt desire begin to rise from her womb, twitching its way up her belly, and filling her own breasts with milk. She moved from merely suckling Rose\u0026rsquo;s breast to licking, caressing, and kissing her beautiful, life-saving breast.\n[Someone is feeling better,] Rose murmured. [You can go right ahead and keep doing that for as long as you like.]\nKate sensed Ann floating away from Rose, sinking below her, then began working her way up Rose\u0026rsquo;s impressive chest towards her neck and face, kissing, licking, and biting her as she went.\n[I\u0026rsquo;m feeling much better,] she said. [Who knew that mermaid milk was good for concussions.]\n[It was a belly-flop, not a concussion; you BooBall,] Rose teased.\n[You haven\u0026rsquo;t called me BooBall since I was a little kid,] Kate said, her eyes shining with the memory.\n[You haven\u0026rsquo;t acted like such a little BooBall in a very long time,] Rose said. [But now, you\u0026rsquo;re mostly grown up, and very lovely. Kiss me.]\nAnn looked up from her embrace with Trevor, and saw Rose and Kate\u0026rsquo;s tails were slowly twisting around one another\u0026rsquo;s, their arms now wrapped around each other\u0026rsquo;s torsos. She watched them kiss and stroke each other as the sun sparkled around them, illuminating everything with a pale, green light. Ann moaned as Trevor suckled a little harder on her breasts, earning a bit of milk for himself. She felt the mer-bonds flicker with energy among the four of them, and her heart seemed to grow larger in her chest. She was so happy \u0026hellip; so loved, she thought.\nShe reached down and pulled Trevor up into a kiss, tasting her own milk on his lips. She felt his cock brush against her vent, and she rolled her hips and felt her top three tail bones, her old thighbones, she remembered, splay out from her pelvic region. It pleasantly reminded her of the feeling she had when she spread her legs when she masturbated. This feeling was very different, however, because her legs were now a mermaid\u0026rsquo;s tail.\nTrevor\u0026rsquo;s cock found its way into her now swelling vent, sighing happily as his length steadily oozed into her. She wrapped her own tail around his, and started to work her hips back and forth, feeling the gentle pull of the water as they created suction when he stroked out, and resistance when they squeezed together. The water forced them into a gentle and steady rhythm, which suited Ann just fine. She wanted to enjoy this session, and she was in no hurry to have either herself or Trevor come to an orgasm.\n[Harder,] Rose urged her sister-wife. [Ohhhhhh, harder.]\nKate pressed her hand harder into Rose\u0026rsquo;s vent, feeling the hard nub of her clitoris wiggle under her first and second fingers. She slipped the two of them into her sister-wife\u0026rsquo;s vent, curling them up, searching for her G-spot. Kate could feel just the bottom of that sensitive area in mermaid wombs, and she jabbed at it with her fingers, pressing her palm into Rose\u0026rsquo;s clitoris.\n[Oh, yes, oh yes, oh yessssssssssssss,] Rose said as an orgasm rippled through her body. She held Kate\u0026rsquo;s head to her shoulder, nuzzling her own nose in her soft, blond hair. She could feel her milk squirt sideways from her breasts that were mashed into Kate\u0026rsquo;s, and she savored the aftershocks of the brief but satisfying release.\n[Your turn,] Rose said, lowering her face to Kate\u0026rsquo;s hips, kissing her sister-wife\u0026rsquo;s green and gold tail, working her way down towards the now open vent.\n[Yesssssssss,] Kate agreed as Ann and Trevor moaned in orgasms below them.\nLeonard Simon patted his belly while pressing it against the railing of the Johanna, a sleek Benetti Super that his partner and client, Michael Thompson, named in honor of his deceased wife. Len\u0026rsquo;s belly grew steadily over the last few years, the product of overwork, a divorce, and advancing age. It was a good belly; his own special friend. He thought of a thousand different ways to lose his belly, but becoming a sea mammal certainly was one he had never considered. He listened to the hollow thump his belly made, while reviewing the circumstances leading up to this moment.\nIt was complicated, he mused, listening to the water slap the sides of the hull below. He looked up at the evening sky, watching the stars slowly drift across the night sky. The Johanna was heading towards the sometimes sleezy port of Davao, one of the largest cities in the Philippines, but they were still days away. Days enough to consider what Michael had shared with his boat-mates, Liz, Peter, and himself. Days and perhaps even weeks away from making the most monumental decision he had ever faced; the decision to become something other than human, and perhaps, something other than male.\nLen sighed and turned away from the sea, feeling the warm salty sea spray against his back as he leaned back on the railing. Michael had shared a tale that could scarcely be believed: mermaids. Mermen too, he reminded himself hastily. But nothing could have prepared him for the way his heart pounded, listening to Michael\u0026rsquo;s tale: his childhood fantasy had suddenly and unexpectedly come to life! He ran his fingers through his still thick brown hair, feeling the salty spray rising up from the bow as it sliced through the warm sea.\nNothing in his life had prepared him for this adventure, so Len felt very much lost, adrift, or \u0026hellip; just simply \u0026ldquo;at sea;\u0026rdquo; he softly chuckled to himself at the pun. He turned back to face the dark sea, watching the water roil alongside the boat, the starlight glinting along the tops of the waves churned up by the Johanna\u0026rsquo;s forward progress.\nHe thought back over his life, the long journey from his relatively innocent mid-western childhood to the somewhat decadent and high-flying lifestyle in which he had landed. The only boats in Ohio were bass fishing boats, riverboats, and the crude rafts he constructed as a young boy on creeks. Now, he represented Michael Thompson\u0026rsquo;s North American operations, multimillion dollar yachts and litigation, both liability and collections, though he operated mostly on the east coast. Michael\u0026rsquo;s business had made him a lot of money, but it had also cost him his marriage.\nLeonard winced as he remembered the long, slow separation between he and his wife, Katrina. They met at Duke, where they were both undergrads, and followed her back to New Jersey where he went to law school. It was a struggle at first, but he then met Michael Thompson when he defended Thompson Marine in a product liability claim, and from that point on, his business picked up. But as he traveled more and more, his wife became convinced he was having an affair, and nothing he could do could change her mind. It was true, in a way. His work with Thompson Marine had become his mistress, and though he didn\u0026rsquo;t want to separate, his wife insisted, and they were divorced a year ago. The pain still clutched within his chest when he thought about it.\nMichael\u0026rsquo;s announcement a few weeks ago that he was going to sell the business to his sons caught Len by surprise. But that shock was nothing compared to the one he had after Michael made him an offer when he arrived to finalize the new business arrangements with his sons, Brian and Brendan. Rather than keep going with his sons, Michael urged Len sell his practice and join him on an adventure that could change his life. Len had a young partner, after all, who handled his west coast operations, and Michael hinted that Len\u0026rsquo;s childhood fascination with mermaids would be satisfied.\nLen looked up at the stars, wondering what that meant: satisfied. Michael couldn\u0026rsquo;t or wouldn\u0026rsquo;t answer his specific questions about how the transformation actually took place, or if he and his fellow passengers would even be allowed to make that ultimate journey. The mystery lying ahead was both frightening and compelling, but Michael had been particularly persuasive. It was a chance to go \u0026ldquo;off the grid\u0026rdquo; and be part of building something new, a new society, perhaps, but one existing mostly in the sea. His wife had cast Len off, Michael argued, and he should think about embracing the newfound freedom. The thought of starting over, of really and radically transforming his life was both exciting and terrifying in equal measures.\n\u0026ldquo;Why me?\u0026rdquo; he asked the night sky softly. \u0026ldquo;Why now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why not?\u0026rdquo; a voice returned softly from the bow, a few meters from where Len stood.\nLen cast his glance to the bow, noticing for the first time the silhouetted figure of Liz in her modified wheelchair. She too had her back to the sea, her hair fluttering in the wind as the bow lifted and fell, slicing through the sea.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Liz. Are you alright?\u0026rdquo; Len asked. \u0026ldquo;Do you need help with the chair? Um, how long have you been up here?\u0026rdquo; he finished awkwardly.\nElizabeth Wainwright smiled patiently at her new boat mate. Although they had met for the first time a few days ago, she had heard much about Len from Michael over the years. She also had more knowledge about Michael\u0026rsquo;s plans than did either Len or their other boat mate, Peter. Although she had initially thought to wait a few more days before playing her part in Michael\u0026rsquo;s plans, this beautiful evening seemed to be a good opportunity to learn more about Len and plant the seeds of their future together.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine, Leonard,\u0026rdquo; she said, letting her chair roll slowly towards him. \u0026ldquo;I actually get around the boat very well on my own.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean anyth\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; Len protested.\n\u0026ldquo;I know, I know,\u0026rdquo; Liz answered, waving her hand dismissively. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just teasing you. Now, then,\u0026rdquo; she continued as she brought her chair to a stop next to him, \u0026ldquo;why don\u0026rsquo;t we have a chat and get to know each other,\u0026rdquo; she finished as she nodded her head towards the bulkhead that rose from the middle of the boat.\nLen smiled and crossed over to the bulkhead and sat down, so their faces were nearly level with one another. \u0026ldquo;What would you like to talk about?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, lots of things,\u0026rdquo; Liz answered, \u0026ldquo;but we don\u0026rsquo;t want to stay out here all night. Let\u0026rsquo;s be frank. I already know a lot about you and how you came to work for Michael, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about why he invited you on this adventure.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean the mermaids?\u0026rdquo; Len asked, blushing.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Liz answered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so glad that you got right to the point.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How much do you know?\u0026rdquo; Len asked, leaning forward.\n\u0026ldquo;How much do you know?\u0026rdquo; Liz returned.\nLen looked carefully at Liz, being familiar with this sort of information harvesting from his experience as a trial lawyer. He was pretty sure Liz knew more than he did, but he knew very little about her. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t decide what her game was, but decided to trust her. Michael had at least told him that much, namely that both Peter and Liz were completely trustworthy, old friends. Len decided that honesty was going to be the best policy.\n\u0026ldquo;Not much,\u0026rdquo; he admitted. \u0026ldquo;Michael told me that we are going on a rescue mission to save some women who were forced into prostitution, then afterwards we would head for an island where there were mermaids, and we probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t return to civilization when we finished.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you think that really means?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked.\n\u0026ldquo;What it really means?\u0026rdquo; Len asked, growing puzzled by this line of questioning.\n\u0026ldquo;Not returning to civilization,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Um, that we would stay on the island,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Michael had said all four of us were castaways of a sort, and it would be a good place for castaways.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you ready to become a castaway?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I already am a castaway,\u0026rdquo; Len said, turning his head and blinking back an unexpected tear.\n\u0026ldquo;What sort of castaway are you?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, the usual sort,\u0026rdquo; Len answered. \u0026ldquo;I woke up one day, discovering I really didn\u0026rsquo;t have anyone in my life who needed me, nor I them. I had drifted away from my family, my work was just something I did to get by, and I was \u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t know \u0026hellip; alone.\u0026rdquo; He sat blinking for a few minutes, lost in his thoughts while Liz patiently watched him. After a few minutes, he asked. \u0026ldquo;What kind of castaway are you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What kind do you think I am?\u0026rdquo; she countered.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I hardly know you,\u0026rdquo; he protested.\n\u0026ldquo;Guess,\u0026rdquo; she said, smiling to soften the challenge.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, Michael has been a sort of castaway since his wife died,\u0026rdquo; Len said, trying to watch her face as he put the pieces together. \u0026ldquo;He never quite recovered from her death all those years ago, but he had two young boys to raise, and so he just soldiered forward. Peter LaMond is another widower, though he was already an old man when his wife died, and my wife left me about a year ago. So, I would guess that your husband left you \u0026hellip; after \u0026hellip; after you \u0026hellip; um,\u0026rdquo; he stuttered as he tried not to look at her withered legs strapped into the wheelchair.\n\u0026ldquo;After I lost my legs?\u0026rdquo; she helped.\n\u0026ldquo;Did he?\u0026rdquo; Len exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;That bastard!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I hardly blamed him,\u0026rdquo; Liz explained. \u0026ldquo;I wanted to die myself. Adjusting to life in a wheelchair is still something I\u0026rsquo;m fighting to do. But that\u0026rsquo;s not what I want to talk about.\u0026rdquo; She shifted her chair so that she was facing the sea with him. \u0026ldquo;What do you think will happen after we get to the island?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The island?\u0026rdquo; Len asked, confused.\n\u0026ldquo;The one with the mermaids,\u0026rdquo; she prompted.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes, the mermaids!\u0026rdquo; Len said. \u0026ldquo;Oh, my god: mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And?\u0026rdquo; she prodded. \u0026ldquo;What does that mean for us, do you think?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That we might become mermaids?\u0026rdquo; he offered hesitantly.\nLiz smiled to herself at his use of the gender Michael\u0026rsquo;s secret plans called for. \u0026ldquo;How do you feel about that possibility?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that what will be happening? Len asked warily. \u0026ldquo;Is it even possible?\u0026rdquo;\nLiz looked around the deck and seeing no one, she nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god,\u0026rdquo; Len sighed, leaning back into the bulkhead behind him. \u0026ldquo;Oh. My. God.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that what you want?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god,\u0026rdquo; Len repeated. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but that\u0026rsquo;s what Michael seemed to hint at.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Would it surprise you to know that Peter is also a lover of mermaids?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked.\n\u0026ldquo;So was Johanna,\u0026rdquo; Len said, putting together more clues. \u0026ldquo;She was mad about them, and that\u0026rsquo;s one reason why Michael trusted me with expanding his business. Did you grow up wanting to be a mermaid?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You first,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;When did you first become attracted to mermaids?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god,\u0026rdquo; Len said, searching for a beginning. \u0026ldquo;I think it was around middle school, maybe 7th or 8th grade.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What was so special about mermaids?\u0026rdquo; she prodded after a moment of silence.\n\u0026ldquo;A bunch of things,\u0026rdquo; he began. Liz nodded encouragement, so he continued. \u0026ldquo;I guess it was the amazing transformation of a woman into a mermaid, and the freedom and seductive nature that they represented.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You saw them as an escape?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe,\u0026rdquo; he answered as he carefully considered the issue. \u0026ldquo;The whole transformation thing may have been something to do with puberty, but who knows. I never shared these thoughts, except with one or two trusted friends. I used to sketch drawings in pencil during study hall of a diver removing her equipment under water and transforming into a mermaid. My friends just thought the pictures were cool, sort of sexy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But they were something more for you, eh?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; he agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;How did it start?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Start?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Book, movie, Hans Christian Anderson?\u0026rdquo; she indicated.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes. A book,\u0026rdquo; he answered.\n\u0026ldquo;And?\u0026rdquo; she prompted patiently.\n\u0026ldquo;My cousin got a book for Christmas called \u0026ldquo;Lucy and the Merman,\u0026rdquo; he explained. \u0026ldquo;Lucy saves a tiny merman from death, and he transforms her into a tiny mermaid and shows her his world. I snuck the book into the bathroom after Christmas dinner to read it - it was a kids book \u0026amp; too young for me, but I wanted to read it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I never read that one,\u0026rdquo; Liz admitted.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, Lucy can turn back into a human as long as she doesn\u0026rsquo;t eat while she\u0026rsquo;s a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Len continued, warming to the memory. \u0026ldquo;I always hoped she would have a snack, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t. But there was a second character who had been rescued from a lifeboat during a storm and stayed with the mers. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember her name.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What happened after puberty?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing much,\u0026rdquo; Len continued. \u0026ldquo;Not until the internet. Then, I realized that there were lots of other people who felt this way, and I started to feel less \u0026hellip; less \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Guilty?\u0026rdquo; she prompted.\n\u0026ldquo;Ashamed,\u0026rdquo; he countered. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t felt guilty, like I was doing something immoral, it was more like a dirty pleasure. It didn\u0026rsquo;t really hurt anyone, but still, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t NORMAL,\u0026rdquo; he said with some defensiveness.\n\u0026ldquo;What changed?\u0026rdquo; she asked, searching his face.\n\u0026ldquo;Um, probably when I started writing my own stories,\u0026rdquo; he admitted. \u0026ldquo;I wrote under a pseudonym, and I only really shared my real name with a few trusted friends, but I still didn\u0026rsquo;t have anyone in real life that I trusted.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Until Michael,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;Until Michael,\u0026rdquo; Len agreed. \u0026ldquo;He talked about how Johanna used to dream of being a mermaid, and so I shared my childhood fantasy with him of being one too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A mermaid?\u0026rdquo; she prodded. \u0026ldquo;Not a merman?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; he shrugged. \u0026ldquo;Am I supposed to say merman?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Liz laughed softly. \u0026ldquo;Not if you want to impress me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do I need to impress you?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe,\u0026rdquo; she teased, looking out at the night sea.\nThey both watched the sea pass beneath them for a few minutes, enjoying the soft, warm, salty breeze that played across their faces and arms as the boat cruised through the dark waves. The stars twinkled softly in the clear sky, and high above an airplane blinked its way across the star-speckled sky.\n\u0026ldquo;Your turn,\u0026rdquo; Len prompted, turning to look at the attractive, elegant, but obviously handicapped lady next to him. \u0026ldquo;When did you want to become a mermaid?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Never thought about it until a few weeks ago when Michael talked to me about this trip,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Never?\u0026rdquo; Len asked, confused. \u0026ldquo;I mean, then why are you here?\u0026rdquo;\nLiz waved her hand along her lap and legs, smiling sadly. \u0026ldquo;You need to ask?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I \u0026hellip; well \u0026hellip; I mean,\u0026rdquo; Len stammered.\n\u0026ldquo;A freak accident robbed me of my legs twenty years ago,\u0026rdquo; she continued softly. \u0026ldquo;I fell off my horse, and broke my back. I was lucky to be alive, my doctors told me, and they worked really hard to help me. My husband didn\u0026rsquo;t. I\u0026rsquo;ve been on my own, more or less, ever since.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; Len said. \u0026ldquo;That must have sucked.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I was rich, and it helped,\u0026rdquo; she laughed. \u0026ldquo;Hong Kong was a great city for me; I had servants, a great view of harbor, and discretion from my good friends. I\u0026rsquo;ve survived, but the chance to be fully healed, to be alive and healthy, to move \u0026hellip; to swim \u0026hellip; to have my personal power back!\u0026rdquo; She caught herself, checking her emotions.\nShe folded her hands across her lap and turned back to face Leonard. \u0026ldquo;I want to have my sense of self back, and even though I\u0026rsquo;ve got more money than Bill Gates, it can\u0026rsquo;t buy me my legs back. I want to move on my own, and if it means that I move with a mermaid\u0026rsquo;s tail, then I am good with that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have more money than Bill Gates?\u0026rdquo; Len asked, deadpan.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, not really, but the Institute for Marine Mammals will be very well endowed,\u0026rdquo; she said with a proud smile, hinting at the pride and strength she hid beneath the blankets that covered her disabled legs.\n\u0026ldquo;The what?\u0026rdquo; Len asked, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, you don\u0026rsquo;t know about that?\u0026rdquo; she mused. \u0026ldquo;Well, now. It seems that you have some homework to do. I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll have to tutor you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Teach away,\u0026rdquo; Len agreed, leaning in to listen to her, ignoring the dangerous, but beautiful, glint in her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;The Institute for Marine Mammals can have a mermaid as the director of operations,\u0026rdquo; Janice argued. \u0026ldquo;It will have a mermaid as director of research! Or are you planning on putting someone other than Pat in charge of the science because it takes a man?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Honey, please!\u0026rdquo; Hank pleaded with his petite but feisty wife. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s keep this to ourselves. Quieter.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hank!\u0026rdquo; Janice admonished, lowering her voice slightly. \u0026ldquo;Will you please take a long hard look at how all the pods operate? There is nothing particularly special about being a merman in terms of how this new society is being organized. In fact, the mermaids are at the center of most of the decision making, and they are inventing both art and science, whereas the mermen are usually at the beck and call of the mermaids. Honey, I\u0026rsquo;m not attacking you or your maleness; I\u0026rsquo;m trying to help you see things as they really are around here.\u0026rdquo;\nHank glanced around the beach. A few yards away, but nearly hidden by the steep shadows cast by the evening sun, Janice\u0026rsquo;s sister Julie slept next to her husband Brian, their entwined forms lightly daubed by the still glowing golden sky. Further up towards the tree line and deeper in shadow were Debra Hutchins, James Riddles, and Pat\u0026rsquo;s sister, Bridget clustered in a small puddle of humanity near one of the beach huts, constructed by Alberto and his men. No one was moving.\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone is tired,\u0026rdquo; Janice noted. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re all asleep. Now will you please talk with me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Harold and Elise aren\u0026rsquo;t asleep,\u0026rdquo; Hank argued.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe, but they are up at the mountainside huts, finally having a family reunion,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;That was a big surprise.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Hank sighed.\nHe remembered the look on Elise\u0026rsquo;s face when she saw her little brother the night before. No one knew that Harold Matthews was related to anyone else, and so while Ann and Kate had transitioned, everyone who was still human worked on unloading the new technical equipment, Hank and crew had brought aboard the Freedom III. Elise recognized her younger brother before he noticed that his older sister was standing on the beach, but both agreed to save the family reunion until after most of the work was accomplished, which took until late in the evening.\nToo tired to talk, everyone had fallen asleep on the beach or in the huts straddling the fringe between the jungle and the sandy beach. Early in the morning, everyone returned to work on setting up the new equipment. Even Dr. Riddles, who was quite elderly, helped with a variety of tasks, from repairing the mountainside huts, to running wires across the landscape for new monitors, sensors, and controls for booby traps, the naval gun, and new solar panels. Amazingly, the nine humans had been very successful, finishing most of the jobs they thought would take several days in only one. It meant that those who wished could transition sooner, rather than later. And that speeded up time table was the cause of Hank\u0026rsquo;s unease.\n\u0026ldquo;I know you feel rushed,\u0026rdquo; Janice continued. \u0026ldquo;But we really do have to make this decision. We can start transitioning tomorrow.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I just don\u0026rsquo;t know how I can \u0026hellip; can \u0026hellip; submit to Brian,\u0026rdquo; Hank explained.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps your son can help you,\u0026rdquo; Janice said.\n\u0026ldquo;My son?\u0026rdquo; Hank exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;I no longer have a son.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Correct. You have another daughter,\u0026rdquo; Rose said softly from her hidden position halfway up the beach.\nHank turned quickly and saw his former son salamander up the beach towards the spot Janice had insisted they occupy. He turned to his wife. \u0026ldquo;You set this up,\u0026rdquo; he said simply.\n\u0026ldquo;I only want what is best for all concerned,\u0026rdquo; Janice said softly. \u0026ldquo;Really, Hank. You must believe me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Dad,\u0026rdquo; Rose interrupted as she drew closer. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s your problem?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean MY PROBLEM?\u0026rdquo; Hank demanded.\n\u0026ldquo;Um, Mom said you were afraid of becoming a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Rose said.\n\u0026ldquo;Afraid, huh?\u0026rdquo; Hank challenged.\n\u0026ldquo;Why else are you putting up such a fuss?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Changing both my species AND my gender was not part of my plans,\u0026rdquo; Hank protested.\n\u0026ldquo;Nor mine,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, reaching out to her father. \u0026ldquo;But I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t change that now. Not for anything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How can you be so sure?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked, taking her soft, small hand in his own, feeling the webbing in between her fingers.\nRose sighed, and then caught her mother\u0026rsquo;s eye and lifted an eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;Wow, I\u0026rsquo;ve got to go to the little girl\u0026rsquo;s room. I\u0026rsquo;ll be back in a bit,\u0026rdquo; she finished as she rose to her feet. She glanced down at her husband, still a fit man despite his age, and wondered if she was really as sure as she thought she was. Her newest daughter smiled up at her, Rose\u0026rsquo;s perfectly white teeth gleaming in the dusk, her dark hair cascading over her shoulders and across her impressive breasts. Rose radiated health, happiness, and a hidden power. Janice drew strength from her daughter\u0026rsquo;s presence.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll take a walk afterwards,\u0026rdquo; Janice added. \u0026ldquo;I might not get the chance to do that very often in the future, eh?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mom,\u0026rdquo; Rose groaned. \u0026ldquo;Go pee.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How un-ladylike,\u0026rdquo; Janice teased as she walked towards the trees.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m still learning how to be a lady,\u0026rdquo; Rose countered.\nBoth father and daughter/mermaid laughed softly, watching Janice make her way silently into the trees, disappearing into the darkening foliage.\n\u0026ldquo;A lady?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;A mermaid is still a lady,\u0026rdquo; Rose said.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you miss it?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Being a boy?\u0026rdquo; Rose asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he added. \u0026ldquo;Walking,\u0026rdquo; he gestured towards the dark hole in the woods where Janice disappeared.\n\u0026ldquo;Not really,\u0026rdquo; Rose said after a moment\u0026rsquo;s thought. \u0026ldquo;First, there is nothing that can explain the power and grace I feel when I\u0026rsquo;m in the water. It\u0026rsquo;s like \u0026hellip; spacewalking and time travel all rolled into one. It\u0026rsquo;s so amazing to be able to just \u0026hellip; be \u0026hellip; just be in and of the water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That sounds like a mystical experience,\u0026rdquo; Hank joked.\n\u0026ldquo;It is, I guess,\u0026rdquo; Rose agreed. \u0026ldquo;But, it is strange to spend so much time on dry land basically lying on the ground. But we can still stand up, though it\u0026rsquo;s not comfortable, and we can salamander faster than some people can run. I guess we just get used to it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about the being a man part?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It didn\u0026rsquo;t take any getting used to,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;It just happened.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tell me about it,\u0026rdquo; Hank urged.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, first of all, Mom is right,\u0026rdquo; Rose declared, shifting her pelvis so she could wrap her tail behind her father, a mermaid equivalent to putting your arm around someone. \u0026ldquo;Mermaids really are in charge.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This isn\u0026rsquo;t about being in charge for me,\u0026rdquo; Hank argued. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s never been about being in charge.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Rose agreed. \u0026ldquo;If it wasn\u0026rsquo;t for Mom, you\u0026rsquo;d never have been a successful businessman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, now,\u0026rdquo; Hank said smiling at the old family joke.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s true,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;Mom gave you a backbone you don\u0026rsquo;t normally possess. It\u0026rsquo;s not that you\u0026rsquo;re weak, it\u0026rsquo;s just that you are naturally gentle, and sometimes that can get you into trouble in the business world.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Look how the undergraduate art major talks now,\u0026rdquo; Hank teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Just because I studied art doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I don\u0026rsquo;t understand people,\u0026rdquo; Rose said seriously. \u0026ldquo;Sometimes, I think it helped me understand people better. But, I\u0026rsquo;m not answering your question, am I?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Hank agreed, letting his left arm rest on Rose\u0026rsquo;s flukes as they curled along his left leg. Her red tail still glinted against the dark sand, catching the last rays of the glowing horizon. Her black fringes were barely visible against the sand. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m actually not sure which is more terrifying, changing gender or changing species.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought you wanted this?\u0026rdquo; Rose asked, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;Your mother is the reason for that,\u0026rdquo; Hank said sheepishly. \u0026ldquo;I want what she wants. Really. I would do almost anything for that woman, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know why this is only just now making me crazy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Becoming a girl really isn\u0026rsquo;t bad,\u0026rdquo; Rose started.\n\u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s not just about being a girl, really. I guess every one wonders what it would be like, you know?\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;I mean, I think every one must think about that at one time in their life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes,\u0026rdquo; Rose agreed, giggling. \u0026ldquo;I thought about it more than once, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know of anyone who didn\u0026rsquo;t at least wonder what it would be like to have your own set of breasts. Remember that old joke?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Hank agreed, relaxing. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a good thing men don\u0026rsquo;t have breasts, otherwise they\u0026rsquo;d never leave the house.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, what\u0026rsquo;s the problem?\u0026rdquo; Rose asked. \u0026ldquo;Are you afraid of becoming a mer?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I\u0026rsquo;m afraid of becoming a mer,\u0026rdquo; he answered. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just that I\u0026rsquo;m not eagerly in favor of it. In fact, it puzzles me why everyone else seems to be so gung ho.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it puzzles me why anyone who sees a mer isn\u0026rsquo;t gung ho,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;And now that I am one, I can tell you that there is nothing to compare it to. I feel healthier, happier, and hornier than I have ever felt before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Horny?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked, trying to ignore his daughter\u0026rsquo;s large breasts as they bobbled beneath her dark hair.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, yes, horny,\u0026rdquo; Rose said with finality. \u0026ldquo;But it\u0026rsquo;s not like the guilt ridden, never-quite-appropriate-horny like when I was young. It\u0026rsquo;s a good horny now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What is a good horny?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked. \u0026ldquo;Is this a girl thing?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s not a girl thing,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;At least that isn\u0026rsquo;t what Trevor says. He likes the way he is horny now too, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to explain. Don\u0026rsquo;t you still get sexually excited with Mom?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Robbie, er \u0026hellip; Rose!\u0026rdquo; Hank exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve never talked about such things before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Dad,\u0026rdquo; Rose said patiently. \u0026ldquo;Mers are different. We have sex all the time, and usually in front of someone else. Now answer the question. Do you still get horny?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; he answered reluctantly. \u0026ldquo;Your mother is still the love of my life. She is very successful at \u0026hellip; um.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Getting you horny,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;Good.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not dead, you know,\u0026rdquo; he protested.\n\u0026ldquo;I know people are supposed to lose some of their libido as they get older, but that never happened to me,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been constantly horny since I was twelve, so it\u0026rsquo;s good to hear that you can still get horny.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can we use a different term?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked, shifting uncomfortably, trying to adjust his bathing suit.\n\u0026ldquo;Dad, relax!\u0026rdquo; Rose chided. \u0026ldquo;Horny is good. Makes you feel alive, alert.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And the world needs more alerts,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, trying to deflect the topic.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha, ha,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of, Dad. Merman or mermaid, you\u0026rsquo;ll be fine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why does your mother think I should be a mermaid?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;She wants you to be her sister-wife,\u0026rdquo; Rose explained. \u0026ldquo;Even though Trevor loves me, and I love him, there is a bond among Kate, Ann, and I that goes beyond that somehow.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What is so special about being a sister-wife?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;That,\u0026rdquo; Rose sighed, \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t explain. I guess that is something of a girl thing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did you secretly want to be a girl?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Rose said simply. \u0026ldquo;I really just wanted to be a mer, both Trevor and I did. It was like a compulsion, almost. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m so confused as to why you are reluctant.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, what is it about the mers that was so compelling?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t see anything?\u0026rdquo; Rose asked, unbelieving.\n\u0026ldquo;I can see that they are beautiful, powerful creatures,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not blind. But I must be missing something. What made you want to become a mermaid?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Rose corrected him. \u0026ldquo;I wanted to be a mer, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t afraid of becoming mermaid, and neither was Trevor. We both took the chance that we would be the one to change into a girl, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem like it was a big danger. The point was to become a mer, and we welcomed the certainty that one of us would also change our gender; it was part of the excitement.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tell me how it happened,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, turning away from his daughter\u0026rsquo;s eyes and scanning the dark sea.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we first had three feedings, one from Pat and Danni, who were pregnant at the time, so their milk was strong, and then from Emma and Cleo, and last from Petra and Galina,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, her breathing changing as she remembered her transition.\n\u0026ldquo;All in one day?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;More or less,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Go on,\u0026rdquo; Hank urged, still not looking at his daughter.\n\u0026ldquo;They gave us a final feeding in two canteens, one that was just mermaid milk, and one that had both milk and semen,\u0026rdquo; Rose continued, her breathing growing more deliberate and heavy. \u0026ldquo;Then we were left alone so one of us could physically dominate the other one. We decided on a wrestling match. It didn\u0026rsquo;t last long, and once Trevor pinned me, it was over in seconds.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Over?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I changed \u0026hellip; inside,\u0026rdquo; Rose continued, searching for words. \u0026ldquo;My mind changed. My body took a bit longer, I don\u0026rsquo;t really remember how long exactly, but not too long because we had done four feedings, and the time it takes for the siren cell to work depends on how many of them are in your body.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Your mind changed?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The siren cell changed me, and it was actually quite pleasurable,\u0026rdquo; Rose answered. \u0026ldquo;You know, I just felt different the moment I turned. That\u0026rsquo;s what we call it, turning. It happened to Pat and Liga and Sandi and Danni and \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I get the picture,\u0026rdquo; Hank interrupted. \u0026ldquo;What exactly is that like, turning?\u0026rdquo; he finished turning back to face his daughter, searching her face as she talked.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s hard to describe,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;But it was so \u0026hellip; fulfilling.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Go on,\u0026rdquo; Hank said.\n\u0026ldquo;Everything made sense,\u0026rdquo; Rose continued. \u0026ldquo;Sights, smells, Trevor\u0026rsquo;s body, my own body, everything just \u0026hellip; fit. I felt \u0026hellip; complete, even though I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel incomplete before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Complete?\u0026rdquo; Hank prompted. \u0026ldquo;What about Kate and Ann?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s strange,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;When Trevor and I changed, it felt complete. When Kate and Ann changed and joined us, it felt complete in a different way. I guess there\u0026rsquo;s a sort of evolution to completeness.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you done, are you complete?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;I am happier and more \u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t know \u0026hellip; connected, satisfied, you know, in love. But \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Rose stopped talking and was lost in thought for several seconds.\n\u0026ldquo;But what?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;But now I can feel something else,\u0026rdquo; Rose answered. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not like a need, I don\u0026rsquo;t need this to be happy or complete. It\u0026rsquo;s more like a desire. I\u0026rsquo;m happy, and so I desire it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Desire what?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;To create a new life,\u0026rdquo; Rose breathed.\n\u0026ldquo;You want to get pregnant?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked, shocked.\n\u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t that amazing?\u0026rdquo; Rose answered.\n\u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;re just a kid,\u0026rdquo; Hank protested. \u0026ldquo;Heck, you\u0026rsquo;ve only been a girl for \u0026hellip; what, two and a half months?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, the mers don\u0026rsquo;t feel any particular age,\u0026rdquo; Rose argued. \u0026ldquo;Remember, some of us were old, some were young, but the siren cell makes it so adults change into more or less the same physical age and abilities. Even Kate and Ann can feel the difference.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They want to become pregnant too?\u0026rdquo; Hank exclaimed.\n\u0026ldquo;Dad, relax!\u0026rdquo; Rose gently chided him again. \u0026ldquo;They don\u0026rsquo;t want to become pregnant yet, but you\u0026rsquo;ll understand more when you\u0026rsquo;re a mer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If I become a mer!\u0026rdquo; Hank said, only half kidding. \u0026ldquo;Have you talked to Trevor about a child?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Rose said.\n\u0026ldquo;But \u0026hellip; but \u0026hellip; but?\u0026rdquo; Hank sputtered. \u0026ldquo;Do you even care how Trevor feels about it?\n\u0026ldquo;He feels devoted,\u0026rdquo; Rose giggled coyly, blushing.\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously,\u0026rdquo; Hank admonished.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s seriously devoted,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, straightening up. \u0026ldquo;Really, this is part of the completeness I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to tell you about. I can feel it \u0026hellip; him \u0026hellip; Kate and Ann \u0026hellip; us \u0026hellip; our bond \u0026hellip; all the time. He might be stronger than we are, quicker than we are, and bigger than we are, but we are in charge, and I know it. If I want a child, then he has got nothing to say about it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously, you\u0026rsquo;d do that to him?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I\u0026rsquo;d tell him,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;But he would do what ever I wanted, that\u0026rsquo;s my point. What ever I asked.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re sure?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Absolutely,\u0026rdquo; Rose stated.\n\u0026ldquo;Your sisters?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Them too,\u0026rdquo; Rose said with confidence. \u0026ldquo;Every mermaid can feel it. It\u0026rsquo;s more than just love, it\u0026rsquo;s the CHEW and who knows what else. Mermen are devoted to their mermaids. They are almost helpless about it, really. It\u0026rsquo;s different than with Kate and Ann, and their love is every bit as real and wonderful as Trevor\u0026rsquo;s. But every time I feel Trevor\u0026rsquo;s eyes upon me, I can feel it as strongly as the first time we made love. It makes me feel really, really, special. Like, TOTALLY loved.\u0026rdquo;\nHank studied Rose\u0026rsquo;s face and noted the clear and unmistakable expression of that love, of that warmth infusing every aspect of her face, her eyes, her voice, and her body. It was like a flash of lightening, a sudden clarity of vision that had been blocked from him for all this time. He could see \u0026ldquo;it,\u0026rdquo; he realized for the first time, \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rdquo; was the thing that made the mers so compelling, seductive, and attractive to anyone who saw them. They were completely, totally, absolutely, and amazingly happy. The enormity of it was staggering. He drew his breath in sharply and sat up, seized by a new question.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not afraid?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Of what?\u0026rdquo; Rose asked, unaware of her father\u0026rsquo;s change.\n\u0026ldquo;Of losing this most precious of gifts?\u0026rdquo; he continued. \u0026ldquo;What would it be like to lose that love?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;DAD!\u0026rdquo; Rose said fiercely, through clenched teeth, trying to keep quiet. \u0026ldquo;Really! You\u0026rsquo;re talking about Trevor or your own daughters being killed!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not my point,\u0026rdquo; Hank argued. \u0026ldquo;It could happen to anyone, and it did happen to Liga and Alexis. It\u0026rsquo;s a fair question.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, it did happen, though none of us were here on that terrible day,\u0026rdquo; Rose agreed. She thought the unthinkable for a few minutes, feeling her stomach fall into a black pit of fear that she had never before faced. She fought back a tear, then turned back to her father.\n\u0026ldquo;It would be awful, of course,\u0026rdquo; Rose said, regaining her composure. \u0026ldquo;But that is such a male thing to say. It may even be a human thing to say.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean by that?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone wants to be loved, right?\u0026rdquo; Rose answered, finally seeing the answer clearly. \u0026ldquo;And many people are sometimes afraid of the very thing they actually desire. It\u0026rsquo;s sad really. I suppose we call it merbonding for a reason. Maybe we\u0026rsquo;re not human any longer. Yes, Liga and Alexis lost their pod-mates, but they recovered, more than recovered, in fact, by joining with Eric and Sally. We cannot help it; we must bond. We are mers. It is our nature to bond. We must be connected.\u0026rdquo;\nHank\u0026rsquo;s jaw dropped. He had missed so much, and the clues were there the entire time. The mers were happy, a happiness most people could never achieve because they could not\u0026ndash;or would not\u0026ndash;give themselves completely to the bonds of love. But for mers, such willingness was a natural part of the basic instincts of being a mer. Mer bonding went far beyond human bonding, and he now realized that THAT was what he wanted\u0026ndash;no needed! This was a Shangri-La for all humanity: to be loved, completely, powerfully, and with the great certainty that such a bond was made of more than mere emotion and promise. Mer-love was made from the very stuff of their minds, their bodies, their cells, and their \u0026ldquo;souls.\u0026rdquo;\nHank just wondered if he could actually pay the price his wife was asking of him.\nMark, Wong and MuSu floated, unmoving, in the shallow water along the edge of the dropoff, beyond which the sea floor plunged into the darkness below. They were waiting for the shark they could already sense below them to appear; each gripped a Bowie knife. The pods had stopped at this small seamount to collect shellfish and seaweed and get a few days rest. Their tasks were interrupted when the mermen sensed a very large shark approaching them quickly from below. Suddenly, the blunt nose of a Great White shark appeared at the edge of the dropoff, then swung towards a school of tuna a few hundred meters away. The mermen watched warily as the nearly two-ton shark turned and continued swimming away from them.\nThey had spent the morning collecting food along the sides of this small seamount that had a very small atoll breaking through the waves, only a few meters wide. Recent volcanic activity could be seen everywhere, but the waters were teeming with life, and their food supplies had dipped after nearly twelve days of constant swimming through deep ocean. They were over half way towards their goal of Davao, but they had to stop, rest, and resupply. They needed all the energy they could muster for their mission to find and rescue the triplet\u0026rsquo;s mother. Their harvesting was interrupted when they had sensed the shark a few seconds earlier.\n[What do you think?] Mark asked via his CHEW.\n[She can sense CHEW!] MuSu answered as the shark turned back sharply towards them, picking up speed.\n[She\u0026rsquo;s quick!] Wong gasped as the shark rocketed towards them, its intentions clear.\n[Bottom, two sides!] Mark directed to MuSu and Wong, each immediately understanding what he meant. They moved slightly away from Mark, each of them prepared to slash at the shark from each side as it attacked Mark.\n[DIE YOU SEA BITCH!] Mark shouted with his CHEW, pointing his knife directly at the shark now moving with great speed towards them.\n[AHAAAAAAAAAAAAA!] MuSu and Wong joined in the mental shouting at the shark, using their knives to focus their CHEW on the animal.\nSuddenly, only a few meters away from the mermen, the shark twisted its body violently, spiraling to the right, apparently losing control. The shark began twitching in random patterns, each movement without fluidity or connection to any other action, like swimming. After a few horrifying seconds, the shark simply stopped moving, other than the quivering of one pectoral fin. A few seconds more, and the now completely still body of the hulking, gray creature began floating slowly towards the surface.\n[What did we just do?] Mark asked.\n[I think we killed it,] MuSu answered.\n[I know that,] Mark continued. [How did we kill it?]\n[I don\u0026rsquo;t care,] Wong said, keeping his knife pointing at the shark.\n[I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, but Great Whites have some of the most sensitive electroreceptors of any shark,] MuSu recounted, relying on his mer-bonds to Emma\u0026rsquo;s knowledge.\n[I\u0026rsquo;m guessing that our CHEW sent a so highly concentrated and focused electromagnetic field towards the shark, it totally disrupted their \u0026ldquo;ampullae of Lorenzini.\u0026quot;]\n[Ampullae?] asked Wong.\n[The system of electromagnetic sensors in a shark\u0026rsquo;s body,] MuSu explained. [It\u0026rsquo;s a lot like our own mer-organs. If we sent enough energy into such a creature, we might have scrambled the poor beast\u0026rsquo;s brain.]\n[We mind-fried a Great White?] Mark asked, blinking at the lifeless body now nearly level with their own, dramatically smaller ones.\n[I guess so,] MuSu answered.\n[I think you\u0026rsquo;re right,] Emma answered, sliding up next to her mate.\n[Nos héros merveilleux!] Esmée exclaimed as she gave a horrified look at the shark that was larger than her entire pod combined.\n[Well, we can have protein supplies for a few days, if we prepare this meat,] Mark said, putting his knife back into its holster on the utility belt around his waist. [I wish we could smoke or salt this meat, but we don\u0026rsquo;t have time. We can worry about the science later, because other predators will come once we start hacking away on this shark. Let\u0026rsquo;s get cracking.]\nThe twelve mers surrounded the dead Great White shark, then began maneuvering it towards the small atoll above. The silver, gray, red, gold, blue, orange, purple, yellow, and white splashes of color swirled around the grey and white shark, making it look dull rather than deadly.\n[Wow, this thing weighs a ton,] Trixi exclaimed, pushing with Homa on the underside of the shark.\n[Two tons, actually,] Emma said.\n[MuSu, how did you know it was a female shark?] asked Mark.\n[You better not say because she was fat,] warned Rikki with a grin.\n[I knew she was female because she was unafraid and in charge,] MuSu answered enigmatically.\n[Female sharks are usually larger than males,] Emma explained to Mark. [But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that they are fatter,] she finished with a nod to her sister.\n[I like MuSu\u0026rsquo;s answer better,] Mark said, winking at his own girls.\nHarold Matthews leaned back in the hot tub, tugging at his shorts he was wearing for the first time. For the past few weeks, he had always been alone when lounging in this beautiful perch halfway up the side of the volcano. Tonight, his older sister shared the hot tub with him.\n\u0026ldquo;You like the view?\u0026rdquo; he asked, looking out over the horizon, watching the last of the setting sun dip below the ocean.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s more beautiful than I imagined,\u0026rdquo; Elise Matthews answered.\n\u0026ldquo;So \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Harold began, but then fell silent.\n\u0026ldquo;So \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Elise agreed.\nThey sat in silence, listening to the soft bubbling of the tub, the whisper of the wind in the trees, and the gurgle of the bamboo pipe spilling a constant stream of cool, fresh water into this rocky outcropping.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you know how I got here,\u0026rdquo; Harold prompted.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Elise agreed. \u0026ldquo;I do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And, I know how you got here,\u0026rdquo; Harold continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;You do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is there anything else in particular that you wanted to talk about?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\nElise shifted a bit, took a deep breath, and said \u0026ldquo;Harry\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Harold,\u0026rdquo; he corrected.\n\u0026ldquo;Harold,\u0026rdquo; she agreed. \u0026ldquo;Sorry. You\u0026rsquo;re not a little boy any more.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nope,\u0026rdquo; he agreed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m 30 years old.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And I\u0026rsquo;m 50,\u0026rdquo; she finished. \u0026ldquo;I suppose I could have been a better big sister.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nah, you were fine,\u0026rdquo; he said, pushing some bubbles around with his fingers. \u0026ldquo;Actually, you were great. Mom and Dad were so mad at you that they left me pretty much alone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They never did understand,\u0026rdquo; Elise said sadly. \u0026ldquo;I wanted them to, but they \u0026hellip; they \u0026hellip; just couldn\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, well, they\u0026rsquo;d really freak out if they could see us now,\u0026rdquo; Harold joked. \u0026ldquo;Being a lesbian is one thing, a polygamous mythical creature is really out there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Polygamy, huh?\u0026rdquo; Elise observed. \u0026ldquo;I guess that\u0026rsquo;s technically true. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t look that way when you\u0026rsquo;re around them, does it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Harold agreed. \u0026ldquo;It just seems natural to them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s my favorite part.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What is?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;They are just what they are,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;No one apologizes for being a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I guess you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;But that\u0026rsquo;s not what is bugging you, is it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Elise said. \u0026ldquo;You turned out to be a pretty smart guy despite our parents.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re the smart one who went to medical school,\u0026rdquo; he countered. \u0026ldquo;I just ran away and became a merchant marine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That was probably the smartest thing you could have done,\u0026rdquo; Elise said. \u0026ldquo;I feel guilty for abandoning you; I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be,\u0026rdquo; he said, shifting uncomfortably. \u0026ldquo;You did the smart thing too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re too nice to be my brother,\u0026rdquo; she teased. \u0026ldquo;Brothers are supposed to tease sisters.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you had been there when I was a kid, I might not have been so nice,\u0026rdquo; he said. Then he saw the look in her face. \u0026ldquo;Oh, god, no! Elise, I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean that the way it sounded. No, I was a mean little kid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;re not a kid any more,\u0026rdquo; she said, smiling through her guilt.\n\u0026ldquo;No, and I\u0026rsquo;m not mean either,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve changed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can see that,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m impressed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, just cause Mom and Dad thought you were the evil spawn of the devil doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I think the same,\u0026rdquo; he said, reaching out to her.\n\u0026ldquo;Why were they so mean and small?\u0026rdquo; Elise said, her voice catching as his arm circled her shoulders.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t really care.\u0026rdquo;\nThe sat together, their backs facing the mountain behind them, the dark sea reflecting the emerging stars and the moon. They didn\u0026rsquo;t move for several minutes.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you want to be like the Henderson\u0026rsquo;s?\u0026rdquo; she asked. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d do that if you wanted to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What, become like your sister and then we go find a new mate?\u0026rdquo; he asked. \u0026ldquo;No, you and the good Doctor will make a great healing pod. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to kick Debra or Bridget out of their turn. Besides, I\u0026rsquo;m not certain that I\u0026rsquo;d be willing to be a mermaid, and I am sure as heck I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be your pod-mate.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, that would be weird,\u0026rdquo; she agreed, relieved. \u0026ldquo;I just wanted you to know that you\u0026rsquo;re still my brother, even though we\u0026rsquo;re not going to \u0026hellip; well, you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re still my sister, regardless of what happens,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not in any hurry, and I\u0026rsquo;ve got a big debt to pay off. The mers will let me know when they need me to change, and that\u0026rsquo;s good enough for me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You really have grown up to be a special man,\u0026rdquo; Elise said, giving her brother a peck on the cheek. \u0026ldquo;The mermaids who get you will be very lucky indeed.\u0026rdquo;\nHalf the world away, Mac Bennett, a former Admiral now recently retired, pushed his rare filet mignon away from the center of his plate and looked longingly at the shark steak on Brent Dawson\u0026rsquo;s plate.\n\u0026ldquo;Why didn\u0026rsquo;t you order the shark?\u0026rdquo; asked Joy Simpson, former CIA operative and old friend of Mac\u0026rsquo;s. \u0026ldquo;Or the salmon?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I just wanted to savor a steak one last time,\u0026rdquo; Mac grumped. \u0026ldquo;Now, it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem appealing. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d say it has something to do with the changes you\u0026rsquo;re undergoing,\u0026rdquo; Annette Dawson, retired CIA and former colleague with Joy, answered. \u0026ldquo;It looks to me like it\u0026rsquo;s speeding up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not in public,\u0026rdquo; Joy admonished gesturing around the crowded restaurant.\n\u0026ldquo;Joy, you\u0026rsquo;re kidding?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked. \u0026ldquo;This is the Old Ebbitt! There are more international drop offs, more Congressional assignations, and more secrets discussed in this place than in Headquarters at Langley. Every world power has swept this place a dozen times, the owners know where their bread is buttered, and we\u0026rsquo;re a block from the White House. No one cares about what two old people who are eating dinner with their children have to say to one another.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are not your children,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;Thank god.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You look it,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;You both look half your age.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which is why we can\u0026rsquo;t fly to Mermaid Island,\u0026rdquo; Joy said glumly. \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t match our passports anymore, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to call in any favors on this one because we can\u0026rsquo;t afford a tail.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will have one soon enough,\u0026rdquo; Mac joked.\n\u0026ldquo;Not funny,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t do anything that will put the mers in danger, and we don\u0026rsquo;t yet have leverage over any of your people or any of my people that might force them to leave them alone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about those anemones,\u0026rdquo; Annette asked. \u0026ldquo;The ones you gave China, the European Union, and the US? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t they do the trick?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Governments don\u0026rsquo;t make adjustments or promises quickly,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;We need more time, and I feel like we\u0026rsquo;re running out of it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Mac agreed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m starting to feel \u0026hellip; um \u0026hellip; itchy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I feel that too,\u0026rdquo; Joy agreed, brushing her now long, young looking brown hair back over her ear.\n\u0026ldquo;If it is any consolation,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, \u0026ldquo;you both look fabulous. Joy, how did you ever let Mac get away when you were young?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We were both focused on our careers,\u0026rdquo; Joy answered. \u0026ldquo;But now we will have time to make up for lost time,\u0026rdquo; she finished, taking Mac\u0026rsquo;s hand in her own.\n\u0026ldquo;Hopefully,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;First, we have to get back to the island without attracting too much attention.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Anyone have any good ideas?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;All we have are bad ones,\u0026rdquo; Brent complained.\nAnnette ticked off a list with her fingers. \u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t fly, your passports won\u0026rsquo;t pass inspection. Can\u0026rsquo;t take a cruise because no commercial cruise lines make that trip. Can\u0026rsquo;t switch cruises mid-way because your passports are worthless. We can\u0026rsquo;t afford to buy a plane that can make the trip on one tank, too easy to track both the purchase and the plane itself. On the other hand, a small airplane, even though it\u0026rsquo;s still expensive, is easy to trace because we would have to refuel in a foreign country, which means passports.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We know,\u0026rdquo; Joy agreed. \u0026ldquo;Our passports are now useless. You two could go, and we can sail. It\u0026rsquo;s the only way to get there without having to go through security or the cost of buying a larger boat.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s safe for you two to be out on the ocean, alone, with those unstable microorganisms doing who-knows-what to your insides,\u0026rdquo; Annette argued. \u0026ldquo;Sailboats wouldn\u0026rsquo;t ever have to make landfall, if you plan carefully, but it would take three or four months to sail from here to Mermaid Island, and that\u0026rsquo;s if you have perfect wind and weather for the entire trip. But \u0026hellip; you\u0026rsquo;d have to know what those microorganisms are doing to you and when they are going to do it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pat said that you probably only had about a month before there were enough siren cells in your bodies to start the change,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t afford a big boat, but we can afford one that will fit all four of us, and if we\u0026rsquo;re going to do this, we ought to do it together and get started right now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How much untraceable cash do we have on hand?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked.\n\u0026ldquo;About four hundred thousand dollars,\u0026rdquo; Brent answered. \u0026ldquo;That will buy a good sailboat, but we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have much money left for three months of supplies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we could get a smaller sailboat big enough for two, and we,\u0026rdquo; Mac said indicating himself and Joy, \u0026ldquo;could swim.\u0026rdquo;\nJoy started to say something, but then she suddenly pitched forward, clutching her stomach.\n\u0026ldquo;Joy!\u0026rdquo; Annette exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;Are you alright?\u0026rdquo;\nJoy lifted her head towards her friend, her large brown eyes crinkled with pain. She opened her mouth to speak, and collapsed into her plate.\n\u0026ldquo;You need to contact the island,\u0026rdquo; Mac whispered, his own eyes flashing with pain he struggled to control. \u0026ldquo;Get help from Pat and \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; and then Mac himself lost consciousness and slumped onto the table.\n\u0026ldquo;Check please,\u0026rdquo; Brent signaled the waiter.\n\u0026ldquo;Should I call an ambulance?\u0026rdquo; the surprised young man asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Annette indicated with a roll of her eyes. \u0026ldquo;They are just young and don\u0026rsquo;t handle their alcohol very well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We could use some help out to catch a cab,\u0026rdquo; Brent said as he slipped a twenty-dollar bill into the waiter\u0026rsquo;s hand.\n\u0026ldquo;Absolutely, sir,\u0026rdquo; the waiter nodded towards the kitchen, and two bus boys headed for the table, each with discrete, though smug smiles visible on their faces.\n\u0026ldquo;There now,\u0026rdquo; the elderly Dr. Riddles said, tying a scrap of cloth over the gash Hank had suffered on his arm. \u0026ldquo;That should protect that cut for a few days.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We could just put mermaid milk on it and it would heal in seconds,\u0026rdquo; Janice said.\n\u0026ldquo;Not now,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;We are having a productive day, getting a lot done. Besides, Pat and the others are busy today. They\u0026rsquo;ve had a big break through.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; Dr. Riddles asked. \u0026ldquo;About what?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They are trying to develop a weapon strong enough to keep the rest of the world from trying to wipe us out,\u0026rdquo; Janice answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Riddles answered. \u0026ldquo;Hardly my cup of tea.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t DO for a good cup of tea,\u0026rdquo; Debra Hutchins complained.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my dear,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Riddles said sympathetically. \u0026ldquo;Only those who have actually been to England understand what it is to have a good cup of tea.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we will get back to work,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, rising. \u0026ldquo;No sense in letting these last few days as humans go to waste. We can get Harold caught up on all kinds of maintenance.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What is to become of that boy?\u0026rdquo; Debra asked, brushing her light brown hair away from her face.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure that fate or circumstance will guide us there, in the meantime many of us have decisions to make, eh?\u0026rdquo; Dr. Riddles noted with a nod towards Hank.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, well, yes,\u0026rdquo; Hank said as he and Janice turned and walked back down the path towards the beach.\n\u0026ldquo;They are very nice,\u0026rdquo; Debra observed.\n\u0026ldquo;They are,\u0026rdquo; he agreed. \u0026ldquo;Well, before he and his wife arrived, I could tell that you wanted to talk with me. Why don\u0026rsquo;t we try again?\u0026rdquo;\nDebra took a deep breath and looked at kindly old man before her. There was so much she wanted to say, so much she wanted, period. Several minutes passed, and she found that she could not say nothing.\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. Connor, your old boss, has told me all about your condition,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Riddles said, breaking the silence. \u0026ldquo;If that is what is worrying you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He what?\u0026rdquo; She sputtered, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;Debra, my dear,\u0026rdquo; he continued, taking her hand. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m an old man, and I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot in my life. Even if Mr. Connor\u0026rsquo;s hadn\u0026rsquo;t told me a thing, I think I would know a transgendered person when I see one, even when they are as beautiful as you are.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But \u0026hellip; but \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Debra sputtered, feeling a burning sensation rise along her throat, her blush taking over.\n\u0026ldquo;You really are quite beautiful, you know,\u0026rdquo; he continued as though nothing was of any particular importance. \u0026ldquo;I am quite sure that most people whom you meet have always thought you to have been a woman. Though I\u0026rsquo;m sure that you simply cannot wait until you can have all the biological features and functions of your true gender. You may rest assured that I\u0026rsquo;ll do anything I can to help.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You \u0026hellip; you \u0026hellip; you \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Debra said, now on the brink of tears.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my dear?\u0026rdquo; he asked patiently.\n\u0026ldquo;You wonderful, wonderful, man!\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed, throwing her arms around him and kissing him on his cheek.\n\u0026ldquo;Now, now,\u0026rdquo; he said with some humor. \u0026ldquo;There will be plenty of time for all of that once I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten a little bit younger. Let\u0026rsquo;s not push me over the brink before I\u0026rsquo;ve had my first mermaid cocktail.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; she said automatically, pulling back.\n\u0026ldquo;No, my dear,\u0026rdquo; he said, taking her hand and drawing her close. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s quite alright. I\u0026rsquo;m just surprised you were worried. I thought you knew I knew.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad you do,\u0026rdquo; she admitted. \u0026ldquo;I cannot wait to become a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You do know the transition will not be easy?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;ve been conferring with several of the mermaids, and they had one other transgendered person make the transition. The first feedings of mermaid milk actually heal your body to its original genetic expression. For a short period of time, you\u0026rsquo;ll be a man again . Once you\u0026rsquo;re healed, you can, well \u0026hellip; submit to me,\u0026rdquo; he shuddered as he said it. \u0026ldquo;Oh, my; how distasteful. In any event, once we work that out, you\u0026rsquo;ll be turned.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Turned?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s what they call it,\u0026rdquo; he said, stroking her hair to calm her. \u0026ldquo;According to them, you just have to be dominated by a male and you\u0026rsquo;ll be turned inexorably towards becoming female again. Now, I am not of a mind to dominate anyone, so you\u0026rsquo;ll just have to be a bit more meek and mild with me than you might normally, and I think we\u0026rsquo;ll be fine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you\u0026rsquo;re alright with all of this?\u0026rdquo; she asked, still a bit surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my dear,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Quite alright. Your body\u0026rsquo;s chromosomes simply do match the gender you truly are. Why should that bother me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Quite so!\u0026rdquo; she agreed. \u0026ldquo;But it bothers a lot of people. I do so wish there were more people like you in this world.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you, my dear,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;One can\u0026rsquo;t worry about what other people think; it will drive one quite mad. Ignore them, and you will be the better for the effort.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I certainly hope so,\u0026rdquo; she said brightly. \u0026ldquo;And I don\u0026rsquo;t give a peck how much it might hurt. I\u0026rsquo;m ready to be a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then, why don\u0026rsquo;t you run along and see what Harold needs help with, and I\u0026rsquo;ll keep tidying up this hut?\u0026rdquo; he suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;You really are a wonderful man,\u0026rdquo; she gushed.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you, my dear,\u0026rdquo; he said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;And you are a wonderful woman no matter what anyone else says. Now run along and get to work.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Does everyone understand why we are doing this?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked the assembled mers, all present except for the three pods who were on the rescue mission to Davao. She looked around the Lab Cave, watching as everyone nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;O.K., then,\u0026rdquo; she sighed, and reached into the isolation chamber with her tongs, gently lifting out a small liquid-filled, green bottle. Everyone in the lab cave held their breath as Pat gingerly moved it across the table to where Phoebe and Alexis waited, and lowered the small, glass vial into the thick metal container. She tried holding her hand as steady as possible, worried that it was a mistake to invite the non-scientist mers to the cave, that the new viral-bacteria they had created were too unstable. But she had to agree with Alexis that everyone deserved to understand what they hoped to accomplish.\n\u0026ldquo;Now?\u0026rdquo; her sister-wife Phoebe asked, nervously holding the top to the metal container.\n\u0026ldquo;Now,\u0026rdquo; Pat breathed, withdrawing the tongs from the opening, allowing Phoebe to position the lid over the thickly lined one-gallon container, held steady by Alexis, which was roughly the size of a milk container, but the structure was over two inches thick, and the threads along the underside of the lid were so fine that they were nearly impossible to see at arm\u0026rsquo;s length.\nEveryone watched in silence as Phoebe carefully started twisting the thick, heavy lid, aligning the threads with the open pot below. Several minutes passed in silence while Phoebe and Alexis worked the steel-gray lid onto the small container.\n\u0026ldquo;John, are you sure that contraption will work?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; John reassured her. \u0026ldquo;The deadly little bugs the girls have created are inert unless mixed with water. \u0026ldquo;This,\u0026rdquo; he said thumping the complex metal contraption he had created, lying next to the pool in the lab, \u0026ldquo;will be set on the sea floor far from any volcanic activity and camouflaged. It\u0026rsquo;s a dead man\u0026rsquo;s drop. If the mechanism is not checked and re-set about once a year, the container will be twisted opened and the contents released into the ocean.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the reset?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;A pod needs to visit and have sex within a few feet of the mechanism,\u0026rdquo; John said with a grin at his own pod. \u0026ldquo;The siren cells we release in our milk and sexual fluids will cause our friendly microorganisms living in this little area here,\u0026rdquo; he pointed to a layer of thin webbing that ran along two bars of the contraption, \u0026ldquo;to stay alive. Their normal life cycles will keep this mesh stiff and strong. If they die, the mesh will dissolve in about a year, and the mechanical spring will do the rest.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, we have sex once a year, and nothing happens,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;But if no mermaid releases milk within a few yards of this machine at least once a year \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;The apocalypse will be unleashed,\u0026rdquo; Galina said with a grim smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Not the apocalypse,\u0026rdquo; Pat admonished. \u0026ldquo;But the world\u0026rsquo;s seawater will be dissociated into oxygen and hydrogen and various minerals.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which is bad, right?\u0026rdquo; Petra said.\n\u0026ldquo;Really, really bad,\u0026rdquo; John agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;What, exactly, would happen?\u0026rdquo; Petra prodded.\n\u0026ldquo;First, the atmosphere would be come supersaturated with all the newly released oxygen and hydrogen,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained.\n\u0026ldquo;And oxygen is highly corrosive and flammable,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe added.\n\u0026ldquo;And hydrogen is just plain flammable,\u0026rdquo; Galina said.\n\u0026ldquo;But we breathe oxygen,\u0026rdquo; Petra protested. \u0026ldquo;How can it hurt us?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The amount of oxygen trapped in seawater, if released, would raise the level of oxygen in the atmosphere by over 33%,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained.\n\u0026ldquo;If that happened, all organic matter, including wet organic matter, like human bodies, would combust at 22 degrees Celsius,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, shuddering.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s room temperature,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained.\n\u0026ldquo;But, we would be killed!\u0026rdquo; Petra exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;Galina, my darling, how could you work on such a thing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Everything would be killed, because we had already been killed,\u0026rdquo; Galina explained.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we would be dead already,\u0026rdquo; John reassured Petra and the others. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the only way this thing would ever activate-if all the mers were killed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But what if something natural kills us off, and we can\u0026rsquo;t check the device?\u0026rdquo; Bill asked, looking over his pod. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s possible, you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Unlikely, given everything we\u0026rsquo;ve learned about the siren cell,\u0026rdquo; Pat countered. \u0026ldquo;We are actually pretty hard to kill. The siren cell not only allows us to heal ourselves from everything but the most traumatic injuries or attacks but it also makes our immune system nearly indestructible.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve been mers for nearly a year and a half,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe added. \u0026ldquo;When was the last time any one of us even got the case of the sniffles?\u0026rdquo;\nPetra furrowed her brow. \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t get sick. Ever?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;There are enough of us now that wiping out all the mers would have to be a deliberate act. The consequences of that deliberate act have to be untenable because we cannot otherwise stop anyone from trying to kill us; so we have to force the major powers to insure that everyone, including themselves, will leave us alone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;MAD,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;Mutually assured destruction.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we all hope that the world will never allow the canister to be opened,\u0026rdquo; Galina said grimly. \u0026ldquo;Petra, my love, I would never create a thing I thought was not something that was either necessary or ultimately good for both us and the world.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I will trust you,\u0026rdquo; Petra said. \u0026ldquo;But I suppose that now I know why you\u0026rsquo;ve been so preoccupied. You haven\u0026rsquo;t talked about your work with us in a while.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said. \u0026ldquo;That sounds so \u0026hellip; middle class, like Galina commutes to work, or something. But Petra\u0026rsquo;s right, the four of you have been pretty shut up for the past few days, and I suppose this explains that. Try not to let that happen too often. For everyone\u0026rsquo;s sake.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We understand,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, looking at her fellow scientists for agreement. They all nodded, feeling a bit chastised. \u0026ldquo;But that is why you are all here now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This is all well and good, but how will MAD help my father and Joy?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Please try,\u0026rdquo; Sally urged. \u0026ldquo;We might kill off all life on the planet, which is bad enough, but what is wrong with my father?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As you know, my love, your father and Joy were both exposed to the microorganisms in the Moon Pool,\u0026rdquo; Alexis explained while hovering over Phoebe, helping her to screw the top into the container. \u0026ldquo;They have already regressed in age, and their bodies are starting to change. I thought I had told you this already,\u0026rdquo; Alexis finished, looking up at her pod mate. \u0026ldquo;I love you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Alexis, I know you love me, but you often have your head buried in your work,\u0026rdquo; Sally said. \u0026ldquo;I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware that we should be worried about what is happening. I don\u0026rsquo;t think you\u0026rsquo;ve ever really explained to me the scope of the problem,\u0026rdquo; she said, looking to Liga and Eric for confirmation.\n\u0026ldquo;We know that they were infected,\u0026rdquo; Eric added, putting a protective arm around Liga and Sally. \u0026ldquo;But we didn\u0026rsquo;t know that it was progressing towards a change so quickly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What kind of change will they have?\u0026rdquo; Sally continued.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not sure,\u0026rdquo; Pat interrupted. \u0026ldquo;Phoebe, Alexis take your time; that seal has to be perfect.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Mom,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe teased. The two of them never the less slowed their efforts as they neared the end of the task.\n\u0026ldquo;We have been in constant contact with your father via short wave, and they are fine,\u0026rdquo; Pat reassured her. \u0026ldquo;They aren\u0026rsquo;t changing into monsters or anything. They are just getting younger sooner than we expected.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What did we expect?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Given the shared morphology of most oceanic microorganisms, we assumed that they would follow a similar chronology in their life cycles,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;For example, Paracoccus pantotrophus is one of the bacterium forming one species of the hundreds of thousands of different microorganisms that living in the Moon Pool. It can live as chemoorgano-heterotroph, which means it eats, or metabolizes, a large variety of organic compounds. It can also live as a chemolithoautotrophic organism, which means it eats, or metabolizes, compounds like hydrogen, sulfide or thiosulfate that are oxidized to sulfate. The sulfur compounds serve as electron donors. Organo-heterotrophy can occur under aerobic or under anaerobic conditions; litho-autotrophy takes place aerobically.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am quite sure I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand any of that, despite Galina\u0026rsquo;s merbonds to me,\u0026rdquo; Petra said. \u0026ldquo;Can you continue in English?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There are a lot of different kinds of micro-bugs living in the Moon Pool, actually all over the place,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe explained, wishing Emma was back, because she seemed so good at translating this. \u0026ldquo;Normally they breed through cell division, which results in two clones of the original. Changes in morphology, which means their structure and function, normally happen very slowly. So, even though they breed often, like about every ten minutes or so, depending on the species, they don\u0026rsquo;t change their morphologies very fast.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mac and Joy?\u0026rdquo; Sally prompted. \u0026ldquo;Can we just get to the point?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Even when you were human, you had lots of microorganisms in your body,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;There are actually more bacterial cells in a human body than there are human cells.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked, slightly disgusted by the thought. \u0026ldquo;Mers too?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mers too,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe confirmed. \u0026ldquo;The problem is that the lingering effects of radioactivity on this island has made the microorganisms more genetically unstable. They are constantly morphing. Microorganisms that eat other microorganisms eat most of those mutations, and our own genetic morphology is amazingly stable. So, the siren cells we produce seem to keep a steady supply of our symbiotic microorganisms going. We don\u0026rsquo;t know how stable they will be in the absence of significant amounts of siren cells.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Sally said, processing.\n\u0026ldquo;Now that we have this device ready,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued to explain to Sally, \u0026ldquo;Mac and Joy can worry more about what is happening to them rather than what might or might not happen to us. We now have MAD, and they can use that threat to help them escape to this island before the unstable microorganisms overtake them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why do they need to get back here?\u0026rdquo; Liga asked, looking up from her chest where her daughter, Mari, was feeding.\n\u0026ldquo;Unlike all of us, they never drank any of our milk,\u0026rdquo; Sally explained, showing her understanding. \u0026ldquo;They don\u0026rsquo;t have any \u0026ldquo;mermaid\u0026rdquo; siren cells in their systems. We\u0026rsquo;re not sure what the microorganisms will do in the absence of siren cells delivered through mermaid milk.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, smiling proudly at her pod-mate. \u0026ldquo;Anyone who is exposed to the microorganisms is infected with a viral packet that about fifty of the thousands of species in the Moon Pool carry. And even though the morphology of those viral packets are a near perfect match to siren cell DNA, we don\u0026rsquo;t know if siren cells are actually produced by an infection. The epigenetic effects are too unpredictable.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Epigenetic?\u0026rdquo; asked Petra.\n\u0026ldquo;Non-cellular forces affecting gene expression,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained.\n\u0026ldquo;Um, in English?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Temperature, stress, hormones, or even the pH balance of the surrounding environment can cause some parts of DNA to control cell division rather than others,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;We think the microorganisms exerted an epigenetic effect on us, meaning they helped us become mermaids. If the change were to happen somewhere else, not in the Moon Pool, we don\u0026rsquo;t know what the effects will be.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about Galina and Alexis?\u0026rdquo; Petra said. \u0026ldquo;They were changed outside the Moon Pool, and they turned out perfectly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But they were also infused with our siren cells and were surrounded by all of us and our mer-organs,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe explained. \u0026ldquo;We were the epigenetic influence for their change. Joy and Mac are too far away for us to get to them and visa versa.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, what\u0026rsquo;s gonna happen to my father?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know, but we advised them to seek saltwater as soon as possible,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;We hope the levels of the microorganisms in their bodies have created proto-mer organs, and if they are really lucky, our siren cells. If true, it would seem like good news, but it is bad because it might start a spontaneous change. If that happens, they are going to need to be in seawater so the microorganisms can absorb and process the minerals and compounds in the surrounding seawater that they use to help us change.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the big insight from Kate and Ann\u0026rsquo;s transformation,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said with enthusiasm, giving the lid a final twist. \u0026ldquo;The microorganisms use minerals from the sea to speed our changes, and multiply as they transform us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are their breeding ground?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Not just us,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe continued. \u0026ldquo;These symbiotic bugs breed anytime they interact with organic material, but they affect that material differently depending on its origins. Remember the fish, and hair, and all that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I remember those experiments,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, smiling at her former niece, both of them blushing at the memory of their own participation in those various experiments.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we believe that when they encounter human material, which matches exactly with the virus DNA they carry, it kicks in a full change,\u0026rdquo; Pat finished.\n\u0026ldquo;In a few weeks,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe started again to distract herself from her memories of the experiment with Petra, \u0026ldquo;Mac and Joy might be in great danger of having the micro-organisms start to harvest their own bodies in the search for the raw materials they need to create new tissues, bones, organs, etc.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought the siren cells do that,\u0026rdquo; Petra said.\n\u0026ldquo;They do, if there are enough of them, and if they were ingested directly from another mer,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;When we underwent our transformations, we had high concentrations of siren cells in our bodies, and were able to use our proto-mer-organs to focus bioelectrical energy on our changes, which were both bio-chemical and electromagnetically guided, and we had access to the biomass of all microorganisms in the Moon Pool, which is substantial. Some of that biomass became our new biomass.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, they might not have mer-organs to guide their change,\u0026rdquo; Petra said, understanding. \u0026ldquo;You said that Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s first change was a one in a trillion-trillion shot-in-the-dark.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;Mac and Joy never drank any mermaid milk, and we don\u0026rsquo;t know what will happen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And they might not have access to enough biomass to make the transformation into mers,\u0026rdquo; Sally said, also understanding.\n\u0026ldquo;But even if they do have access to biomass and our siren cells fully developed in their bodies,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said as she handed the now sealed container to John. \u0026ldquo;No one has ever changed solely from the influences of the Moon Pool, so that adds to why we don\u0026rsquo;t know what will happen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We should have given them our milk,\u0026rdquo; Sally said.\n\u0026ldquo;Hindsight is always 20/20,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s their prognosis?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked, her mothering instincts coming to the fore.\n\u0026ldquo;We really don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with some fear. \u0026ldquo;We hope that both of them had enough body mass of their own so the micro-organisms could create proto mer-organs.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which we think happened when they passed out in a restaurant,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, watching as John carefully positioned the container within the dead man\u0026rsquo;s drop he had built.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know for sure what happened,\u0026rdquo; Pat argued. \u0026ldquo;And they haven\u0026rsquo;t reported a repeat in the last several days. But, I don\u0026rsquo;t think that they have enough siren cells in their bodies to make the changes yet, and they certainly don\u0026rsquo;t have enough to undergo the change painlessly. We hope that seawater will be enough for them to make the full transition without our help.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t they just fly here?\u0026rdquo; Petra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;They probably don\u0026rsquo;t match their passports any longer, and they were both too important in the government to pass security without being noticed,\u0026rdquo; Sally said.\n\u0026ldquo;So, what are we going to do?\u0026rdquo; Eric asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;No one here can travel that distance to help them soon enough. It would take almost two months of near constant swimming to reach the east coast of the US, and Sally is right; they can longer use their own passports. They will have to find a way to get through this on their own.\u0026rdquo;\nEmma watched MuSu\u0026rsquo;s yellow-fringed flukes rise and fall inches from her own out stretched hands. The warm, dark water rushed past her, caressing her body as she swam in his wake. Her sister-wives were slightly ahead of her, each one trailing the ends of MuSu\u0026rsquo;s wide pelvic fins. She could feel the extra drag of her utility belt, but knew the added weight of the shark meat would be worth the extra time it took to reach Davao. She nevertheless wondered how MuSu could pull the large net suspended from his own utility belt. His net contained the same weight of dried and salted shark meat as she herself weighed, but he seemed tireless.\nShe wished she could \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; the connections binding her to her podmates like Eric could, but she felt satisfied she could feel them. She wondered what allowed him to do that. All of the testing they had tried did not provide them with the slightest clue. She was struck by the sudden thought that she missed her fellow scientists.\n[Oh, hey!] she sent out via her CHEW.\n[Yes?] MuSu\u0026rsquo;s quiet calm was discernable even through his CHEW.\n[We need to find a spot so that we can report,] Emma said. [It\u0026rsquo;s time.]\n[How can you tell?] Rikki asked.\n[She just can,] Cleo said. [It drives me crazy.]\n[We heard you,] Trixi sent forward, as MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod was far ahead of Wong\u0026rsquo;s and Mark\u0026rsquo;s. [Just let us know when you\u0026rsquo;re ready.]\n[Emma?] MuSu asked with his usual implacability.\n[Maybe another two degrees west,] she suggested. [We\u0026rsquo;re nearly there.]\n[I wish they would stop that,] Cleo complained. [It\u0026rsquo;s like Emma\u0026rsquo;s brain is hooked up to a GPS system.]\n[You\u0026rsquo;re just jealous,] Rikki teased. [It\u0026rsquo;s not a GPS; she\u0026rsquo;s got a photographic memory.]\n[Same thing,] Cleo grumped. [And this bag is so heavy.]\n[You can give it to me when we stop,] MuSu said.\n[No you can\u0026rsquo;t,] Rikki interjected. [He\u0026rsquo;s got more than his fair share as it is.]\n[Can you see it?] Emma asked, ignoring her sister-wives' argument.\n[Yes,] MuSu reported.\nA small seamount loomed up out of the darkness below, the coral growing along the sides of the rocks glowing dimly in the moonlight. The top of the seamount was only about five meters below the surface, but it looked as though it had been years since any volcanic activity had occurred. As they drew closer they saw an area capable of sheltering them from the strong currents welling up from below, and they headed for the rocky outcropping.\nTogether, MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod approached the ledge and drew up still in perfect formation. Silently the three mermaids reached for MuSu\u0026rsquo;s utility belt, carefully unhooking the large net he was pulling. They let the net settle onto the flat rock below, and MuSu stretched his back forwards and backwards.\n[Are you alright?] Emma asked.\n[Fine,] he said, smiling reassuringly.\nEmma looked over her mate as he smiled back at her. She could see the strain in his CHEW, but outwardly, MuSu was not letting anyone see what it had cost him to pull that extra weight for so long. Emma felt a twinge in her own back and reached around to rub the small of her back.\n[No,] MuSu said, flicking his tail and coming to her side. He held Emma\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fin in one hand, while slowly massaging the juncture where her torso and tail met. She closed her eyes in appreciation.\n[I\u0026rsquo;m next,] Cleo said.\n[You didn\u0026rsquo;t carry as much as Emma did,] Rikki said. [You don\u0026rsquo;t deserve a turn.]\n[Cleo is next,] Emma said, groaning as MuSu pressed firmly into her sore muscles.\n[I carried more than she did,] Rikki protested.\n[But Cleo can\u0026rsquo;t help but be who she is,] MuSu said with a smile at Rikki. [And we love her just the same.]\n[YOU might,] Rikki said petulantly.\n[Emma\u0026rsquo;s right,] Cleo said contritely. [Rikki, you should be next.]\n[Who\u0026rsquo;s going to do MuSu?] Emma asked.\n[All of you,] he said with the slightest twitch of his lips.\n[Oh, yes,] all three mermaids giggled despite their fatigue, feeling their bodies responding to MuSu\u0026rsquo;s undertones.\n[Trixi?] Pat raised her hands to her tiara, trying to focus all her CHEW towards the far away mermaid.\nAll the mers floated in a fan formation above the rocky seafloor along the west side of Mermaid Island. Pat floated at the point of the fan, facing west, while behind her were John, Danni, and Phoebe. Their three daughters paid little attention to their parents' efforts as they played and swam among their nearly motionless tails as they floated vertically in the dark water. Directly behind John\u0026rsquo;s pod were Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s pod and Eric\u0026rsquo;s pod, and behind them Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pod, Tuo\u0026rsquo;s pod, and Bill\u0026rsquo;s pod were fanned out in formation. All of them were attempting to boost Pat\u0026rsquo;s signal, but no one had any idea how they were supposed to be helping.\nPat had first tried by herself, but then called out for help after many minutes had passed without a successful connection. Trixi\u0026rsquo;s signals had been growing weaker over the past several days as the three pods moved further and further away, but this was the first time that Pat felt worried that their CHEW might not span long enough distances.\n[Trixi?] Pat sent out into the inky darkness, feeling the presence of her fellow mers as they floated behind her.\n[Yes, mom,] the faint reply finally coming back.\n[Yes, now I\u0026rsquo;ve got it,] Eric reported. [Just barely, though.]\n[Can you hear me?] Pat asked.\n[You\u0026rsquo;re coming through much louder than two night\u0026rsquo;s ago,] Trixi reported. [What are you doing that\u0026rsquo;s different?]\n[You\u0026rsquo;re still pretty weak,] Pat said. [I\u0026rsquo;ve got everyone here with me trying to help me boost my CHEW.]\n[Wow,] Trixi said. [How are you doing it?]\n[We are in a big triangle, with me at the apex, all pointing in your general direction,] Pat said.\n[O.K.,] Trixi said. [Give me a minute.]\nA few moments passed.\n[This better?] Trixi sent out with much greater strength.\n[Yes,] Pat said with relief. [It really works! You\u0026rsquo;re coming in much stronger.]\n[We are doing the same thing, but how does it work?] Trixi asked.\n[We can figure that out later,] Pat said. [Status?]\n[We\u0026rsquo;re on schedule,] Trixi reported. [One bit of good news; we killed a shark yesterday with just our CHEW. The boys were basically mentally shouting war cries at the shark as it approached. Emma thinks that because a Great White\u0026rsquo;s ampullae are more sensitive than most other species, it worked with that animal. We\u0026rsquo;re not certain it would work on other creatures or even other sharks.]\n[She\u0026rsquo;s probably right, but that is still great news,] Pat agreed. [We\u0026rsquo;ll look into that phenomenon here. The Johanna is still on schedule.]\n[All systems go, then?] Trixi asked.\n[We are still at a go,] Pat answered. [Next chat is in two days?]\n[Yes, unless we need something sooner,] Trixi said.\n[Be safe,] Pat said.\n[Yes, mom,] Trixi said. [Nite.]\nPat relaxed, feeling their connection fade into the regular \u0026ldquo;noise\u0026rdquo; of the sea. She blinked her eyes, her temples were throbbing and she could feel tightness along her lower back. [Eric, what did you see?] She asked, ignoring her own discomfort.\n[Well, normally, like now, there are multiple lines of connection flickering among all of us, like those toys we used to play with where you put your finger on the glass globe and all the flickering goes to that one point,] Eric said, swimming towards the front to face Pat. [That\u0026rsquo;s what happened when we concentrated on you, all those lines focused on your \u0026hellip; well \u0026hellip; your um \u0026hellip;.]\n[You mean my ass?] Pat laughed. [Well, it\u0026rsquo;s not an ass any more. That got moved around to the front.]\n[Well, um, yes,] Eric stammered. [It still sort of looks like a \u0026hellip; well \u0026hellip; um, an ass, and yours is a very nice one. Anyway, our lines snaked into you, but Trixi\u0026rsquo;s CHEW hit your tiara and traveled down your dorsal fringes to where our lines went into your \u0026hellip; um \u0026hellip; ass.]\n[That makes sense; I think I\u0026rsquo;ve got a backache,] Pat said. [And a headache. Whatever is happening when we do that, it\u0026rsquo;s hard work for the person at the focal point.]\n\u0026ldquo;Then use your voice,\u0026rdquo; John said into the water, his resonate mer-voicebox cycling the air in his chest past his now rarely used vocal chords. \u0026ldquo;We can still talk.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we can,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed.\n[But let\u0026rsquo;s get you back to the Moon Pool,] Danni sent via her CHEW, her mothering instincts taking over. [You can grill Eric about what he saw after you\u0026rsquo;ve had some rest.]\n[Yes,] Phoebe agreed, looking carefully at her pod-mate. [Besides, I can do the post with Eric, I usually take the notes anyway. You go rest. We can see the strain in your eyes.]\n[All right, all right,] Pat said via her CHEW. \u0026ldquo;Ohhh,\u0026rdquo; she moaned out loud.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s it!\u0026rdquo; John shouted. \u0026ldquo;Everyone stop using CHEW with Pat, (he paused to generate more air) what do singers call that thing they do when they are sick?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Vocal rest,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Fine,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;Pat is on CHEW rest until further notice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, does anyone else hear that?\u0026rdquo; Eric asked, his voice tinged with worry.\n\u0026ldquo;Hear what?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked.\nEveryone grew still, the dark sea filled with a great white noise passing for silence. Then, they could all hear it, one sound rising about the general hum. A boat, a large boat throbbed its way through the water, and it was getting closer.\n\u0026ldquo;The second son has finally arrived,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said with grim determination.\n\u0026ldquo;How do you know it\u0026rsquo;s him?\u0026rdquo; Bill asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Those are the same engines as Manalo\u0026rsquo;s first boat, the one that Michael Thompson sold back to Abao,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said.\n\u0026ldquo;You can recognize the engine noise?\u0026rdquo; Bill asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I never forget the sound of an enemy,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel said with a fierce smile.\nAbao looked over the deck of his brother\u0026rsquo;s boat, pleased with the remodeling he had accomplished. The 50-caliber machine gun was his favorite touch. His crew was arranged behind armored positions along the sleek yacht, making it look both intimidating and ridiculous. In the bright early morning sunshine, he could see small huts arranged along the tree line between the jungle and the beach, and swung the bow towards them. He hoped to catch everyone still asleep, and it looked as though he was successful.\n\u0026ldquo;Now!\u0026rdquo; he shouted, and his men opened fire on the beach. Most of them had small arms, but the big gun started chewing up the sand, trees, and the huts, sending shards of beach hut, palm trees, and debris flying in all directions. He expected to see Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men burst forth from the huts, but nothing moved, other than the havoc wrought by the 50-caliber.\n\u0026ldquo;Stop!\u0026rdquo; he ordered.\nAbao throttled the big boat\u0026rsquo;s engines back, letting her drift towards shore, scanning the beach for any signs of resistance or movement. Nothing moved. He waited for a full minute, but nothing even twitched. Where was everyone?\nSuddenly, the boat lurched suddenly as the engine seized. Abao shouted at his men, ordering them to shoot into the water. They must have scuba gear, he thought, and were trying to attack the boat from below. Everyone stood up from behind their armored positions and began firing into the water, the bullets sending up a fine mist as they zipped into the water.\nSeveral meters below the yacht, several mermen watched with curiosity as the bullets slowed within a meter of the surface and began sinking gently towards the bottom. With an unseen signal, they all took one last look at the small device attached to one of the boat\u0026rsquo;s engine coolant intake valves and quickly swam away. If their adversaries above had stopped firing useless bullets into the water, the mers might have been spotted. But no one above could see anything in the lagoon through the hail of useless gunfire.\n\u0026ldquo;Stop!\u0026rdquo; Abao shouted again, realizing they were just wasting bullets. He had to repeat the order several times before everyone stopped firing. In the eerie silence that followed, the odd sight of three dolphins leaping out of the water just beyond the entrance to the lagoon distracted Abao and his crew. They watched the acrobatic display for a few seconds, then all of them were thrown to the deck as an enormous hollow THUMP shook the boat. The hull lurched in the water, and Abao was thrown to the deck. As he scrambled to his feet, he saw water welling up from below.\nThere must be a hole in the boat the size of a car, Abao thought to himself. He knew he could not stay on the boat for very long, but if Alberto and his brother were in the water, he didn\u0026rsquo;t want to go in empty handed. He braved the rising water, desperately searching for his Uzi. He felt the cold steel in his hands even as the water covered his head. He swam out of the hatch, pushing away from the deck, struggling to separate himself from the sinking boat\u0026rsquo;s undertow, but before he could start swimming for the surface, he felt a sharp prick on his leg, and felt a deadness spreading up his legs and into the rest of his body. When it reached his other arm, the Uzi slipped from his grasp, and knew that now was his time to die.\nHe wondered briefly, if he was going to drown or be killed, then suddenly he was being pushed towards the surface. He watched as the surface grew closer and closer, and while he couldn\u0026rsquo;t move a muscle, nevertheless he wondered how long he would be able to hold his breath. His face broke through into the air, and a second later, he pulled in a long breath of fresh air.\n\u0026ldquo;How many?\u0026rdquo; Abao heard a voice ask. He tried turning his head towards the speaker but could not move.\n\u0026ldquo;Five,\u0026rdquo; the answer came from the opposite direction. \u0026ldquo;The two who were up front died in the blast.\u0026rdquo;\nAbao could do nothing but look up at the sky. His heart pounded in his chest, and he knew he was paralyzed, but didn\u0026rsquo;t know how or why.\n\u0026ldquo;Are the girls ready?\u0026rdquo; the second voice continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we\u0026rsquo;re going to do it right here, with Snort and his girls present,\u0026rdquo; the first voice answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Are the CHEW boosters ready?\u0026rdquo; asked the second voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; the first voice answered. \u0026ldquo;If they work, I hope we can find a way to get them to Mac and Joy.\u0026rdquo;\nAbao heard the distant commotion of voices shouting on the beach and one of the two speakers ducked under the water and swam away from him. Ha! He knew that there had been someone in the huts! Hopefully, he and his men had at least killed a few of Alberto\u0026rsquo;s men. Girls? Had Alberto brought some of the girls that were to have gone into his father\u0026rsquo;s brothels to this island? His father! Abao felt that familiar tightness in his gut, knowing he had failed his father yet again. His thoughts were broken by the return of one of the two voices.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s going to be alright,\u0026rdquo; the voice said reassuringly. \u0026ldquo;Some shrapnel got Dr. Riddles, but everyone is alright. Bill and his girls are with him now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I guess Dr. Riddles and his girls are going to start their transition sooner than they expected,\u0026rdquo; the second voice said with a chuckle. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get moving.\u0026rdquo;\nAbao felt himself being pushed through the water, and as they pushed him gently along, one of them began to undress him. He wanted to shout and protest, but could do nothing. Quickly, he was divested of his clothes, and heard the sound of the waves along the sand more clearly. He must be getting closer to the shore.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s good,\u0026rdquo; he heard a female voice say, and he stopped moving. He heard something small and light hit the water near his head, and wanted to flinch, but he could not move at all. His only sign of fear was a few quick blinks.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry,\u0026rdquo; he heard the first male voice say. \u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really hurt much, and you\u0026rsquo;re not going to die. If the girls whipped up a batch that does everything we think it can do, you\u0026rsquo;ll be free in no time.\u0026rdquo;\nAlthough he spoke English perfectly, Abao had no idea what any of that meant. None of these voices sounded remotely familiar, and he wondered if these people had defeated both Alberto and his brother. He felt a small cushion being positioned under his head with a small strap that went across the front of his neck. As soon as it was secure, he felt the hands holding him leave. He had a momentary panic, fearing he would sink, but the cushion was apparently a float of some kind, and he merely drifted in the gentle swell of the lagoon. He felt another body bump into his head, and smelt garlic. It had to be one of his crew—all of them smelled of garlic.\n\u0026ldquo;This will feel like a small prick,\u0026rdquo; a female voice said, feeling a needle pierce his arm. As the stranger slowly pressed on the plunger, Abao could feel a warm liquid flow into his body. It tingled, almost like a burning sensation, but it was not painful. He could hear the same reassurance repeated in Spanish and then in Filipino. He wondered how the speaker knew he spoke English while his crew did not.\n\u0026ldquo;Are the boosters and the sensors ready?\u0026rdquo; the same female voice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we\u0026rsquo;re ready to go,\u0026rdquo; another female voice answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Give me a sec,\u0026rdquo; the first female said, and Abao could hear her duck her head back under the water. He felt the vortex of a large fin kicking to move away from him, then there was silence. All he heard was the gentle sound of the waves washing up on the beach and the cry of sea birds overhead. There was also the sound of gentle lapping of the water on his own, or someone else\u0026rsquo;s, body.\nSuddenly, a dolphin\u0026rsquo;s call broke the silence, and Abao realized that the creature must be very close to him. A second dolphin answered the call and then a third. In the background, he could hear something that sounded like women humming a low tone, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sure.\nThe tingling in his arm grew worse, and soon his entire upper body was buzzing with energy. He felt the paralysis wear off slowly, the tingling replacing it with a feeling of his flesh vibrating. His body started twitching, and he wondered if he would be able to swim away, somehow find his gun, and fight his way clear. He could hear the near constant chattering laughter of the dolphins, and he felt as if his mind was being tortured.\nThe vibrating flesh feeling now covered his entire body, and he could fell his limbs twitching and jerking randomly at his sides. The water around him was also boiling. Wait, no, not boiling, but thousands of tiny bubbles were rising all around him. He no longer felt paralyzed but neither could he seem to control his limbs. Just when he thought he might have control of his legs, a great pressure seemed to press in on them, and they just shriveled up. He felt his lower spine stretch out, and there was some pain with that, but it felt more like serious discomfort, rather than serious pain.\nAs he thrashed in the roiling water, he was thankful for the floatation cushion under his head, keeping his head in the air. He wondered what was happening to him, but fear clouded his mind. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t concentrate. Suddenly, his head felt like a giant vice was squeezing his forehead and someone was pulling his jaw forward. Every bone in his body felt like putty being pushed and pulled in all directions. His brain was being filled with alien thoughts, and he couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out what they meant.\nNo longer could he feel any of his limbs clearly, but his arms felt as if they had shrunk and all his joints were frozen. He felt his head slip off the cushion, and he rolled over onto his stomach. He was holding his breath, but didn\u0026rsquo;t dare breathe. His insides felt like mush, and knew that whatever was happening to him, it was not a simple change. He lost track of time as his entire body felt like taffy being pulled and pushed in many directions all at once. He was barely aware that he was breathing through his nose, but it felt strange, as if his nose was on top of his head. That was impossible!\nThe sound of the buzzing grew, feeling a strange new force pressing in on his mind. He fought it off, but it still pressed in, harder and harder with each passing second. \u0026ldquo;I am Abao,\u0026rdquo; he thought fiercely to himself, and then his mind seized for just a second and foggy whiteness filled his senses. \u0026ldquo;I am not BaBa!\u0026rdquo; he fought back. It was the last human thought he had.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure that you\u0026rsquo;re alright?\u0026rdquo; Debra asked, her voice etched with concern.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure that I\u0026rsquo;ll be fine,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Riddles answered. \u0026ldquo;The mermaid milk is working quite well, thank you.\u0026rdquo; He smiled over at Mae who had just fed him some of her milk and sprayed it over his thigh and Debra\u0026rsquo;s hand, stopping the blood flow. There was still some lingering pain from where the fragment of one of the rounds from the 50-caliber had torn through his leg, severing an artery. Debra\u0026rsquo;s quick thinking, pressing her hand over his wound, probably saved his life. He briefly wondered if Mae\u0026rsquo;s yellow and blue tail would affect the colors of how he turned out.\n\u0026ldquo;Take your hand away, my dear,\u0026rdquo; he said to Debra. \u0026ldquo;It really has healed already.\u0026rdquo;\nFearfully Debra lifted her hand, expecting to see the ragged gash she had only moments ago covered with her hand. Beneath her hand was smooth, white skin, looking much younger than the skin surrounding the wound site. Miraculous.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it looks like we should get the four of you started,\u0026rdquo; Pat said as she salamandered up to the small cluster of people gathered around the quickly healing Dr. Riddles. \u0026ldquo;Sis, is everyone ready?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;More than ready, thanks to Debra\u0026rsquo;s quick action,\u0026rdquo; Bridget McDonnell, Pat\u0026rsquo;s older sister answered.\n\u0026ldquo;And you four are settled?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, eyeing each one carefully.\n\u0026ldquo;Absolutely,\u0026rdquo; Debra answered, looking up from Dr. Riddles' healed leg.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my dear,\u0026rdquo; the doctor answered.\nBridget and Elise held hands and both nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;Right then,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll get you all started while we wait for Hank and crew to settle up their plans. Anyone have any preferences?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, Mae\u0026rsquo;s already got me started,\u0026rdquo; Dr. Riddles noted. \u0026ldquo;Does changing feeders seem to have any negative effects?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We think that the greater the diversity you have in feeders, the stronger the effects of the siren cells,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, since we have some extra healing to do thanks to Mr. Dimaunahan\u0026rsquo;s second son,\u0026rdquo; he said, \u0026ldquo;why don\u0026rsquo;t we start with some mothers and some privacy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what I thought,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed and nodded to Mae who salamandered over to Bill.\n\u0026ldquo;Did the experiment with the dolphins work?\u0026rdquo; Mae asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, it was a great success,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;There are five new female dolphins, all of whom are linked to us, possessing superior intelligence for dolphins, but significantly less so than humans or mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Bill said. \u0026ldquo;I wonder how many more sons Mr. Dimaunahan has.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;One more,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;Can you send for my girls?\u0026rdquo; she asked. Bill and Mae nodded and headed back to the water. A few moments later, Phoebe, Petra, and Galina made their way up the beach.\n\u0026ldquo;Danni\u0026rsquo;s got our brood,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported. \u0026ldquo;Xing\u0026rsquo;s got theirs.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Debra, why don\u0026rsquo;t you start with me,\u0026rdquo; Pat suggested. \u0026ldquo;You do know that this first one will actually hurt a bit?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You know?\u0026rdquo; Debra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat said gently. \u0026ldquo;You will technically \u0026ldquo;heal\u0026rdquo; back to being a man, and then you can begin your journey to biological femininity. Your soul has always been female, and now your body can finally catch up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How does everyone know all this?\u0026rdquo; Debra asked, drawing her knees into her chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Not everyone knows,\u0026rdquo; Pat reassured her. \u0026ldquo;But my sister and I do share some secrets.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry Debra,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said as she settled herself into Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s lap. \u0026ldquo;Soon you will be my sister-wife, and then we can share our own secrets.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, we don\u0026rsquo;t have very many secrets here,\u0026rdquo; Petra said as she settled herself next to Elise. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll understand why once you\u0026rsquo;re a mermaid, Debra.\u0026rdquo;\nDebra looked at Petra\u0026rsquo;s incredible breasts, which were easily the largest breasts she had ever seen. She watched as Elise quickly positioned herself in Petra\u0026rsquo;s lap and began to suckle. Petra\u0026rsquo;s eyes closed with pleasure as she fed the older woman the life-giving and life-changing milk she possessed.\nDebra turned to Pat\u0026rsquo;s outstretched arms and once again was arrested by her overwhelming beauty. Soon, she reminded herself, she too would be as beautiful. She crossed over to Pat, sank to her knees, then turning over on her back. She could feel her small breasts shift on her chest. She had a momentary twinge of regret. Her hard won breasts, years of hormone therapy and surgery, and she was about to lose them. Well, only for a little bit, she reminded herself silently. She looked up at Pat\u0026rsquo;s large breast hanging over her face, and parted her lips as Pat lowered a nipple into her open mouth.\nShe surrounded the large nipple with her lips and began suckling. As the warm, sweet milk seeped into her mouth, Debra could feel a heat rising in her body. After several minutes of nursing, Pat switched breasts and continued to feed. Debra felt her body growing more and more feverish, but continued drinking. She felt Pat\u0026rsquo;s other breast run dry, and rolled away onto her side, clutching her groin and stomach, feeling a fire build between her legs. This was not a fire of passion, but a fire of healing. Of rebuilding tissue that had been removed, unwanted tissue, a return to her original genetic structure.\nShe felt a gentle hand come to rest on her shoulder, and knew it was Dr. Riddles. Her body twisted and turned as tissue was rebuilt and foreign objects were expelled. She moaned in pain.\n\u0026ldquo;Be easy, my little one,\u0026rdquo; he said as he gently held her shoulder.\nDebra moaned again, her pain lessening, but her psychic pain was building. She could feel the parts of herself returning, and her female underwear and shorts were crushing her newly rebuilt penis.\n\u0026ldquo;Hold me,\u0026rdquo; she said, turning her body into his.\nDr. Riddles folded his arms around her, pulling her head into his lap. He continued to stroke her hair, waiting for her to stop moaning in pain. After a few minutes, Debra felt the pain subside, then opened her eyes and looked up at Dr. Riddles.\n\u0026ldquo;Dr. Riddles?\u0026rdquo; she began.\n\u0026ldquo;I believe you really ought to call me James, now,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;James?\u0026rdquo; she repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, dear?\u0026rdquo; he asked. \u0026ldquo;What can I do for you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Kiss me?\u0026rdquo; she asked timidly.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course, my dear,\u0026rdquo; he answered, lifting her head gently towards his. She felt him brush his lips on hers, and after a moment of internal panic, something tickled the base of her brain. Something clicked. She opened her lips to his and felt \u0026ldquo;it;\u0026rdquo; her body turning, matching what her mind had known for years. Her shoulders relaxed, and the pain in her abdomen lessened. After another minute of kissing, James lifted his head from hers and smiled, his pale blue eyes already looking brighter and bluer.\n\u0026ldquo;Again?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, again,\u0026rdquo; she said, tilting her face towards him. All the pain was worth this wonderful feeling of simply giving herself to this warm and gentle man.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I know,\u0026rdquo; Brian agreed. \u0026ldquo;It is sort of weird. But to be a part of all this,\u0026rdquo; he said, his arm tracing a circle to include the entire island and sea near where they stood. \u0026ldquo;Now, THAT trumps any weirdness I feel.\u0026rdquo;\nHank watched Brian\u0026rsquo;s hand as it swept across the horizon, and then his gaze returned to the spot at the mouth of the lagoon where the now much larger pod of dolphins frolicked in the afternoon sun. He knew that Tuo\u0026rsquo;s pod was still sweeping the sunken yacht for any bugs, tracers, or transmitters that might be used to trace their location back to Abao\u0026rsquo;s father, but nothing of their efforts could be seen from the beach. Hank heard a bird cry from within the jungle and was reminded that James and his girls were already three feedings into their transition. They would be joining the mers in the Moon Pool the next morning for their final change. And, as seemed to be the tradition, James and his girls were spending their last night on land at the mountainside huts and hot tub.\n\u0026ldquo;So, you would \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Hank could not continue.\n\u0026ldquo;Listen,\u0026rdquo; Brian said, turning towards his brother-in-law, his military bearing stiffening his spine. \u0026ldquo;Your wife loves you more than she can ever or will ever love me, that much I\u0026rsquo;d stake my life on. Now, I don\u0026rsquo;t pretend to understand what they have planned this or why they want to follow this path, but I do know that if Julie asked me to be her sisterwife, I\u0026rsquo;d be freaked out, but I think I would do it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Think?\u0026rdquo; Hank challenged.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;d be lying if I pretended that the shoe was really on the other foot,\u0026rdquo; Brian said. \u0026ldquo;They haven\u0026rsquo;t asked me, and that makes me think that I\u0026rsquo;m lucky. You\u0026rsquo;re right. I don\u0026rsquo;t know, really, how you must feel. I guess I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, in a way, but at the same time, I\u0026rsquo;m glad. You know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nope,\u0026rdquo; Hank said with a sigh. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. One thing has changed for me, actually. I finally understand why becoming a mer would be wonderful, but I\u0026rsquo;m still not sold on why or even how I should become a mermaid, especially, you know, your \u0026hellip; mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you\u0026rsquo;d really be Janice\u0026rsquo;s mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Brian said with a grin. \u0026ldquo;She has made that very clear to me, I can tell you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What if I want to be my own mermaid?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked more rhetorically than actually.\nBrian shrugged, looking back out at the playful dolphins.\n\u0026ldquo;So, what do you think having my wife as your pod-mate would be like?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked, suddenly enjoying the way Brian was visibly squirming.\n\u0026ldquo;Um, well, I \u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t really think about, well \u0026hellip; you know,\u0026rdquo; Brian sputtered. \u0026ldquo;I mean, she is still your wife, you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I know,\u0026rdquo; Hank agreed. \u0026ldquo;But still, I\u0026rsquo;ve thought about being with Julie once or twice. Don\u0026rsquo;t tell me you haven\u0026rsquo;t done the same thing with Janice!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, yea,\u0026rdquo; Brian agreed, a blush creeping across his cheeks. \u0026ldquo;Of course, I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m not \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Dead?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked. \u0026ldquo;Yet?\u0026rdquo; he said again with just a small hint of menace.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, now,\u0026rdquo; Brian pleaded. \u0026ldquo;You brought this whole damn thing up. Ease up on me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How are you ever going to become my pod-mate?\u0026rdquo; Hank wondered out loud.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Brian protested. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t think I can do it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I can do it,\u0026rdquo; Hank said.\nA few more awkward moments passed between them.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you know what Janice wants you to become?\u0026rdquo; Brian asked.\n\u0026ldquo;A mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Hank answered with exasperation. \u0026ldquo;Haven\u0026rsquo;t you been listening to anything we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, no,\u0026rdquo; Brian explained. \u0026ldquo;What kind of mermaid, you know? What would you look like, your new name, stuff like that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;No, actually.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Haven\u0026rsquo;t you talked about it with her?\u0026rdquo; Brain asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Sort of,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;But we have never gotten to that level of detail yet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Have you thought about it?\u0026rdquo; Brian asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to,\u0026rdquo; Hank answered.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve never wondered what it would be like to be a girl, not even for just a little bit?\u0026rdquo; Brian challenged.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course I\u0026rsquo;ve wondered,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, growing exasperated. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never taken further than the most superficial speculation. What, do you have a name for your possible girl-self?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Brian said. \u0026ldquo;I guess we\u0026rsquo;re alike in that. I\u0026rsquo;ve wondered, but only briefly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right, so I\u0026rsquo;m the lucky one,\u0026rdquo; Hank said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Brian agreed.\nThey both watched the sea for a few minutes, each lost in thought.\n\u0026ldquo;So, why do you want to become a mer?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Because Julie wants to,\u0026rdquo; Brian answered.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;Not good enough. We all have to have our own reasons, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned at least that much. What do you want by becoming a merman? Seriously.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously?\u0026rdquo; Brain stalled.\nHank nodded, remaining silent. After a few more seconds, Brian spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;When I look at how powerful the other mermen are, how they move through the water, wow,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Then, when I see how their mermaids are so devoted to them, you know, I want that. I want that feeling of \u0026hellip; of \u0026hellip; taking charge, of taking responsibility, you know?\u0026rdquo;\nHank smiled to himself. Mermen in charge? Hardly. He wondered if Brian had ever spoken to any of the other mermen. He was certain Brian had never spoken to Kate and Ann, and he was pretty certain both Janice and Julie were keeping him largely in the dark about what \u0026ldquo;taking responsibility\u0026rdquo; as a merman actually meant.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I know, taking charge,\u0026rdquo; Hank agreed. \u0026ldquo;So, do you know what the girls have planned for us?\u0026rdquo; He asked, secretly enjoying the irony of the question, hoping that Brian wouldn\u0026rsquo;t notice.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Brian admitted sheepishly. \u0026ldquo;They won\u0026rsquo;t tell me. Julie said that I would just screw it up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think you\u0026rsquo;d screw it up,\u0026rdquo; Hand said supportively. \u0026ldquo;But I do think that the girls are determined to get their way. I suppose it\u0026rsquo;s useless to fight them any longer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s it?\u0026rdquo; Brian asked. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re just going to give in?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I learned a long time ago that I do much better when I let the woman I\u0026rsquo;m in love with be in charge,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;From the first kiss to the first child, it is always better for the man when the woman makes the decision.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ha! Now, that\u0026rsquo;s girl talk,\u0026rdquo; Brian said. \u0026ldquo;I can see why they want you to be the sister wife.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;All right, air-brain-boy,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;What is the best sex you\u0026rsquo;ve ever had?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s this got to do with you?\u0026rdquo; he demanded.\n\u0026ldquo;Humor me?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been your brother-in-law for nearly twenty years.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Best sex ever?\u0026rdquo; Brain asked. \u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be Julie, and you won\u0026rsquo;t hold it against me or tell her?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Scout\u0026rsquo;s honor,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, making the sign with his right hand.\n\u0026ldquo;This amazing flight instructor I had in basic training,\u0026rdquo; Brain said remembering.\n\u0026ldquo;What, a real Top Gun experience?\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;You never told me about that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You never asked, and it was right before I met Julie,\u0026rdquo; Brian said. \u0026ldquo;Anyway, she was fantastic.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Date or one night stand?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Three nights,\u0026rdquo; Brian said. \u0026ldquo;I would have done more, but she moved on. A second lieutenant wasn\u0026rsquo;t good enough for her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who asked whom to go to a motel?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It was her room,\u0026rdquo; Brian said. \u0026ldquo;And she asked me,\u0026rdquo; he said with pride.\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly,\u0026rdquo; Hank said.\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly what?\u0026rdquo; Brian said.\n\u0026ldquo;She was in charge,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;When a woman says \u0026lsquo;no,\u0026rsquo; it means no. When a woman says \u0026lsquo;yes,\u0026rsquo; it still means no. But when a woman says \u0026ldquo;Come back to my room and fuck my brains out,\u0026rdquo; it means \u0026lsquo;hell yes\u0026rsquo; to the best damn sex any one will ever know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Huh,\u0026rdquo; Brian said. \u0026ldquo;I never thought of it like that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Obviously,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, starting to walk back up to the beach huts.\n\u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; Brian asked.\n\u0026ldquo;To see if I can have the best damn sex of my life,\u0026rdquo; Hank answered.\n\u0026ldquo;oooooooohhhhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Debra groaned feeling her insides churn, the siren cells finally reorganizing her internal organs into a female configuration.\n\u0026ldquo;Does it hurt?\u0026rdquo; James asked, his bright blue eyes shining in the setting sun.\n\u0026ldquo;Not really,\u0026rdquo; she lied, looking up into his now young face.\nJames' formerly white hair was now a lovely, rich brown. His skin was lightly tanned and taut, his jaw line looking particularly handsome, Debra thought. She loved the way he looked at her. She loved the way all three of her new pod-mates had been looking at her for the past twenty-four hours. The focus they showered upon her had transformed her into the girl she had known herself to be since she was a little boy. But, she still didn\u0026rsquo;t know what the combined effects of the siren cell and her pod-mate\u0026rsquo;s bioelectrical, proto-mer influences had wrought.\n\u0026ldquo;Here, drink,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said, moving through the hot tub so that she could move her youthful breasts over Debra\u0026rsquo;s lips. \u0026ldquo;My milk has already started.\u0026rdquo;\nDebra opened her full and soft lips to receive Bridget\u0026rsquo;s extended nipple, the end already oozing a few drops of white milk. She took it into her mouth and felt the warm milk fill her cheeks. It tasted wonderful, but sensed it wasn\u0026rsquo;t nearly as strong as any of the other mermaids who had already fed her. She knew it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help with the pain as much as Bridget intended, but she loved her new pod-mate for the thought.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s amazing how quickly your milk has come in,\u0026rdquo; Elise said, giving her perky breasts a squeeze. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m barely there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pat says it runs in the family,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said, savoring the sensuality that came with any feeding. \u0026ldquo;Does that help any?\u0026rdquo; she asked as Debra finished up.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Debra said, it only being half a lie. \u0026ldquo;I feel much better.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s good, pumpkin,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. \u0026ldquo;Because it looks like your bread has been baked.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Debra said, grimacing a little bit. \u0026ldquo;I might look done on the outside, but the inside is still cooking. It feels like someone stuck a spoon through my belly button and is giving everything a good stir.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, trust me, when you\u0026rsquo;re done, it will have been worth it. I know you are the one who had to change the most,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. \u0026ldquo;But I have to say that I love my changes a lot!\u0026rdquo; She laughed, shaking her new long brown hair over her youthful and slender shoulders.\n\u0026ldquo;Hang in there,\u0026rdquo; James said. \u0026ldquo;Only a little while longer, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be 100% girl.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She certainly looks it now,\u0026rdquo; Elise said, pushing her very long blond hair back over her ear. \u0026ldquo;And I\u0026rsquo;m a medical doctor too, James.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t look like a doctor any more,\u0026rdquo; Bridget teased. \u0026ldquo;You look like a Playboy Bunny.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No ears,\u0026rdquo; Elise said, shaking her head of beautiful new hair at her lover.\n\u0026ldquo;You do look like a Playboy Bunny,\u0026rdquo; Debra said. \u0026ldquo;But I just can\u0026rsquo;t place which one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are all Playboy Bunnies,\u0026rdquo; James agreed. \u0026ldquo;However, I\u0026rsquo;m just glad that our pod will be the healers of this new little world we\u0026rsquo;re building. Now that our proto-mer organs have developed, I can, for example, verify that the lovely Elise is, in fact, a doctor, without her having to tell me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; Elise asked, furrowing her brow, and focusing on James. \u0026ldquo;Oh, my. It works, we\u0026rsquo;re starting to bond.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; James agreed. \u0026ldquo;And I hope that our mer-learning will help Debra and Bridget become healers as well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think it will,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said, smiling at her former lover who was now her pod-mate. \u0026ldquo;Elise, you always said my spirituality was actually an instinct to try to heal the world. But I hope that when I know all the anatomy you do, I won\u0026rsquo;t lose my spirituality.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps we will gain some of yours,\u0026rdquo; Elise said. \u0026ldquo;I might tease you, but I think a little reverence for the mysterious is a good thing. I just can\u0026rsquo;t stand your brother\u0026rsquo;s inflexible ideology.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean Cory right?\u0026rdquo; Debra asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I only have one brother now,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;I love having a new sister, and soon I\u0026rsquo;ll have another one, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Debra said, her eyes shining. \u0026ldquo;You nearly do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would like your brother Cory very much,\u0026rdquo; James said. \u0026ldquo;People who think they know all the right answers usually make the wrong diagnosis.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Absolutely,\u0026rdquo; Elise agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Debra, are you alright?\u0026rdquo; James asked as she rose up from his lap.\nDebra nodded as she sat up a little, letting the water drain from her now very long, light brown hair. She looked closely at her new podmates, enjoying how very much attached she was to each of them.\nJames had her strongest bond, she felt. He was now a hale and hearty twenty-something with rich brown hair, sparkling blue eyes, and broad, well muscled shoulders. Bridget, Debra decided as she turned her attention to her, favored her sister, Pat, with rich brown/auburn hair that shimmered between red and brown, with bright hazel eyes.\nLike Pat, she had a generous figure with high, full breasts, a very small waist, and wide womanly hips. Elise was slimmer than Bridget with long, thick, straight blond hair, rich brown eyes, and a long, slender body with full generous hips. Her medium breasts were high and tight, with small tight nipples. Her legs were long and elegant, and it was hard to think of her as a medical doctor, standing next to Bridget in the hot tub perched on the side of a volcano in the middle of paradise.\n\u0026ldquo;Lisa Matthews!\u0026rdquo; Debra said, smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;Who is Lisa Matthews?\u0026rdquo; ask Elise. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t have any cousins or nieces named Lisa.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She was a Playboy Bunny from the early 90s,\u0026rdquo; Debra explained. \u0026ldquo;You look just like her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think they are called Playmates,\u0026rdquo; James corrected.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, Playmates or Bunnies, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter to me,\u0026rdquo; Elise said. \u0026ldquo;Besides, you look like one yourself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think she is finally cooked,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said.\nDebra looked down at herself. Bridget was right; she was now a she, only this time all the internal plumbing worked! She secretly wished for a mirror so she could see what she finally looked like, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to leave the hot tub. She was glad her breasts had returned, though now they were much larger, and they felt softer and fuller. Her nipples were significantly larger, and now that she had raised herself out of the warm water, they were getting pleasantly stiff in the evening air.\nBelow her out-thrust breasts, she could both see and feel her waist was much slimmer, but the biggest difference was that her hips were much, much wider than they were before the change. Her legs were still long and sleek, but now there was a two-inch gap between them at her crotch. Her legs did not meet until her knees. Another big difference was feeling her own blond hair falling the length of her back, brushing the top of her now generously proportioned ass.\n\u0026ldquo;What do I look like?\u0026rdquo; She asked, timidly.\n\u0026ldquo;You look like a mix of yourself, Bridget, and Elise,\u0026rdquo; James answered. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve still got your own face and lovely brown eyes, but you\u0026rsquo;ve inherited Bridget\u0026rsquo;s top half and Elise\u0026rsquo;s lower half.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, why didn\u0026rsquo;t I get bigger breasts?\u0026rdquo; Elise teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Because both James and I like them the way they already were,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. \u0026ldquo;Besides, one of us had to give Petra a run for her money, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But your breasts are larger than they used to be,\u0026rdquo; Elise said, hefting one in her hand.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I wonder who was doing that to me?\u0026rdquo; Bridget asked, appraising first James, then Debra, and then her lover. \u0026ldquo;I keep forgetting that when we were younger, Elise was such a breast hound.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, too bad, huh?\u0026rdquo; Elise teased.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m grateful to you, Elise,\u0026rdquo; Debra said as she softly stroked her new breasts. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just so happy to be complete and whole.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think that James might have had a hand in the final size of your breasts too,\u0026rdquo; Elise said.\n\u0026ldquo;I was a fan of Sophia Loren,\u0026rdquo; he admitted, smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going to have to stop doing that,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said, watching her own breast move as Elise continued to gently lift and squeeze her.\n\u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; Elise asked slyly.\n\u0026ldquo;Because \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Bridget answered as Elise grabbed her and kissed her soundly. They folded their bodies into one another\u0026rsquo;s and began to kiss in earnest.\nDebra felt her own breathing laboring, watching the two long-time lovers make love. Her own insides had finally settled down, and grew aware of a different sensation rising from her crotch as Bridget and Elise continued to stroke, hug, and kiss one another. After a few more minutes, she felt a throbbing emptiness, a sweet dampness, and a gentle swelling—all at the same time. They had worked their hands in one another\u0026rsquo;s crotches, stroking and teasing, while they kissed and licked one another\u0026rsquo;s lips, necks, and faces. She looked back at James, who was also watching Elise and Bridget make love. Debra could see his now larger penis rising up beneath the water.\nShe turned to face him, feeling her large, soft breasts shift on her chest. She reached out and gently grasped his erection, pulling him towards her.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re sure, my dear?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes, please yes!\u0026rdquo; she pleaded, working her way towards one of the sides of the tub. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m cooked \u0026hellip; all done \u0026hellip; I can tell.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re sure,\u0026rdquo; James said, his own breathing rising with passion as the sounds of sex filled his ears. Elise and Bridget were each urging one another onward, cooing, moaning, and kissing.\nDebra felt the edge of the hot tub against her now full and firm ass, and pushed with her toes, lifting herself up onto the smooth, warm rock surrounding the tub. She twisted her wide hips back and forth, scooting backwards, enjoying how each jiggle of flesh reminded her of her own dramatic transformation. When she was firmly on the smooth rock, she lifted her knees exposing herself to James. She was still holding his penis, so placed it at the entrance to her flowering sex. When she felt his swollen crown on her equally swollen labia, his stiff flesh touching her there for the first time, a burning wave of desire swept through her.\n\u0026ldquo;Now, please now,\u0026rdquo; she urged, letting go of his penis and leaning back on both her hands, arching her body onto his flesh colored spear.\nShe felt his stiffness slide the first inch into her, and locked eyes with him. She let her knees fall further apart, marveling silently at how easily they did that. She lifted her chest, watching with satisfaction as his eyes were drawn to her shifting mounds of flesh. She rolled her shoulders, making them slide back and forth across her ribs.\n\u0026ldquo;More,\u0026rdquo; she urged. \u0026ldquo;Really, I\u0026rsquo;m really ready.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my dear,\u0026rdquo; James agreed, and pushed into her slowly.\nShe gasped as his second inch entered, and they both felt the barrier of her own hymen stopping him.\n\u0026ldquo;More,\u0026rdquo; she hissed, her breath labored. \u0026ldquo;Do it.\u0026rdquo;\nJames wrapped his hands under her knees, holding them apart and pulling her legs up towards him. He backed out from her vagina just a little bit, and then with a slight grimace of effort, slammed into her.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, god!\u0026rdquo; she cried, feeling both pain and pleasure rip through her, searing lightening bolts of sensation rocketing in all directions over her torso.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, god,\u0026rdquo; James panted, feeling the molten heat of her virginal tightness.\nDebra lifted her hands and grabbed James' arms, holding herself in a V, as he rocked her body back and forth over the fulcrum of her newly bountiful ass. She could feel her entire body shake as James' hips slammed into her own, and she gripped his forearms tightly, feeling the power of his strokes both in her pelvis and in her arms. Together, they started grunting, the water splashing up and spraying both of them as James plunged his body into hers.\nDebra could hear all four of them moaning, and began feeling the steely vibrations of an orgasm rising up from her brand new womb. Her grip on his forearms tightened even further, her moans rising to screams of passion, urging James to go faster, deeper, harder. He did. The insides of her thighs begin quivering uncontrollably. A small bead of sweat formed on the end of James' nose, and watching it fall towards her breasts, she gave herself over to the tidal wave of pleasure rolling through her. Her toes clenched, her back arched, and her breasts shook, thrusting up towards James' now grimaced face. Her eyes rolled back in her head as she struggled to contain the force of the orgasm, her body involuntarily twisting and twitching as the pleasure raced through her.\nJames watched the beautiful creature beneath him lose control, her face twisted in an expression of purest joy, then he felt a twinge of aggression clench deep behind his cock, and gave a particularly forceful thrust into her shaking body and erupted inside her throbbing vagina. They both remained frozen together, un-moving except for their struggled breathing and Debra\u0026rsquo;s still twitching legs. They didn\u0026rsquo;t release their grip on one another until they felt the feather light touches of their pod-mates upon their now newly formed gill fronds along their backs.\n\u0026ldquo;God, what a night!\u0026rdquo; Janice exclaimed, stretching like a cat in the morning sun.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Hank agreed, watching his beautiful wife bend her body back and forth. \u0026ldquo;That was one of the best nights of sex we\u0026rsquo;ve ever had.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I bet Julie and Brian were jealous,\u0026rdquo; Janice said.\n\u0026ldquo;They sounded like they were having a good time too,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, casting a glance to the beach hut several meters from where he lounged in his own doorframe. \u0026ldquo;And it looks like they haven\u0026rsquo;t woken up yet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good, because now you owe me an answer to my question from last night,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, settling herself back down next to him.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright. Here goes,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, taking Janice\u0026rsquo;s hand in his. \u0026ldquo;Whatever it is that you want me to become, I will. I only know that I want to be with you forever, as man or mermaid, I no longer care.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, Hank! I will spend the rest of eternity making sure that your trust in me was the right thing to do,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, nearly squealing with delight.\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, kissing her, feeling her body mold itself into his as they kissed.\n\u0026ldquo;But, you have to do one thing for me,\u0026rdquo; Hank said, when they broke their kiss.\n\u0026ldquo;Anything,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, her eyes bright with emotion.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t do it,\u0026rdquo; Hank said in a whisper.\n\u0026ldquo;But you just said that \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Janice protested.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Hank silenced her with a fierce whisper. \u0026ldquo;I just can\u0026rsquo;t make myself submit to Brian. You have to do it for me, tie me up or something, I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Janice said quietly, understanding.\nShe looked at the other hut to see if anyone had stirred. Nothing. She turned back to Hank, searching his face for clues as to what she should do or say. His blue eyes, so like Kate and Ann\u0026rsquo;s, were clear and bright; he wasn\u0026rsquo;t lying. He just couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring himself to take the first step. She thought how he might look like his own daughters, and had to take a breath to contain her excitement. She and Julie had long planned on how they would make Hank turn, but now she had to adapt her plans to Hank\u0026rsquo;s acquiesce.\n\u0026ldquo;How soon, do you think?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Right now,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;Before I have any more time to think about it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we do have to wait for James and his girls to finish changing,\u0026rdquo; she reminded him.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, but it only takes minutes now,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;The longest part of the process is the long swim to the Moon Pool from the lagoon.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Other than the day or two for the three feedings,\u0026rdquo; Janice agreed. \u0026ldquo;How long since they left?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;About an hour ago,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;They should be back any time now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You forgot about the transformation orgy,\u0026rdquo; Janice reminded him.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;Well, then I guess we\u0026rsquo;ve got some time to kill. Crap.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you want to talk about it?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked. \u0026ldquo;You know, have a little input in what you will become?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Janice, I can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Hank said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m giving myself to you, don\u0026rsquo;t make me do more than I can.\u0026rdquo;\nJanice smiled at her husband, seeing the conflict he felt. She kissed him again, putting all the passion she could muster into it. When she felt his body relax and respond, she broke away.\n\u0026ldquo;Stay here,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, rising. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be back in a little bit.\u0026rdquo;\nJanice scampered over to the other beach hut and poked her head through the curtains. Julie and Brian were entwined together, still sleeping. It had been days since anyone wore any clothes, and the sleeping couple looked like a sexy tourist advertisement. She entered the hut and nudged her sister\u0026rsquo;s foot.\n\u0026ldquo;Whaaa?\u0026rdquo; Julie asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Get up,\u0026rdquo; Janice said softly. \u0026ldquo;We have some planning to do.\u0026rdquo;\nJulie blinked open her eyes and sat up. \u0026ldquo;He said yes?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Janice said.\n\u0026ldquo;Who said yes?\u0026rdquo; Brian asked, yawning.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about who said yes,\u0026rdquo; Julie said, rising. \u0026ldquo;You just make sure you do what you\u0026rsquo;re told when you\u0026rsquo;re told to do it. Got it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, boss,\u0026rdquo; Hank said sleepily, rolling over to the warm spot on the fronds that she had just left.\nThe two women smiled and left the hut for a walk in the jungle.\nDebra\u0026rsquo;s back was arched, her arms were outstretched, and her long pink tail with its green fringes and fins shimmered above her tilted back head. Her long, thick hair had lightened even more so that it was more of a pale, honey blond than a light brown, and it floated in the water around her face and shoulders. The intensely pleasurable grip of her transformation suddenly released its hold on her body, and she relaxed.\nShe looked around the Moon Pool as the other pods began to collapse onto themselves in a swirl of color and milk. She saw her own pod come towards her, everyone now complete. James was now an incredibly chiseled merman, with a long dark green tail fringed with light green highlights. Green, he had explained when he was changed, was the traditional color of healers. His long brown hair framed a handsome face with bright blue eyes, a generous mouth, and a strong chin. Elise complimented her fellow healer, her long tail shimmering in a pale, light green while her fringes and fins were highlighted with dark green. Her rich brown eyes sparkled with new light, and her long blonde hair was still straight as a string, but thicker and richer than it had ever been before. Bridget now looked more like her sister Pat, both her sea green tail with pink fringes and her long now more-auburn-than-brown hair nearly matching the family coloring. Debra sighed with enormous contentment. The mere sight of her pod thrilled her; they were surely the most handsome and prettiest mers of all.\n\u0026ldquo;Now you\u0026rsquo;re totally cooked,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said, floating to a stop next to Debra. \u0026ldquo;Completely done.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Completely female,\u0026rdquo; Elise agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Completely mermaid,\u0026rdquo; James added, his new long penis stiffening towards her.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m the luckiest mermaid in the world,\u0026rdquo; Debra said, reaching her arms out to enfold all three of her pod-mates. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so bloody lucky!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are all very lucky,\u0026rdquo; James agreed, positioning his cock at the entrance to Debra\u0026rsquo;s vent.\n\u0026ldquo;Absolutely,\u0026rdquo; Elise agreed, as she and Bridget positioned themselves on James' vibrating pelvic fins.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Debra sighed, as she closed her eyes, savoring the long delicious stretching of her womb as James slid into her.\n\u0026ldquo;I think I might have a solution,\u0026rdquo; Annette offered.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re open to anything at this point,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, holding her stomach while trying not to throw up.\n\u0026ldquo;You have convinced us that just jumping into the sea and hoping for a miracle is a bad idea,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know what the microorganisms are doing to us, and we need time to sort these things out. So, we need a haven, a hideout, a something. What have you got?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I worked with an amazing computer analyst a few years ago,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;His name is Jackson Baker, and he is sort of an odd duck.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Water birds; that\u0026rsquo;s a positive sign,\u0026rdquo; Mac joked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, his family owns this amazing place on the Chesapeake Bay,\u0026rdquo; she continued. \u0026ldquo;He regularly invites Brent and I to spend a few weekends a year with him. It\u0026rsquo;s a private island, about four acres, and it looks pretty non-descript.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, gaudy McMansion?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered. \u0026ldquo;Completely normal sort of place, but still, it\u0026rsquo;s a private residence on a private island in the middle of the largest estuary in America.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do we want with an island in the Chesapeake?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked, his face showing the strain his body was enduring. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s fresh water, and we need sea water, according to the last message from Pat.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;True, it\u0026rsquo;s not sea water, but it\u0026rsquo;s close,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t get it,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll have to explain it to me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The island is in the lower part of the bay, near the polyhaline zone, which basically means that the surrounding water is almost as salty as sea water,\u0026rdquo; Annette continued. \u0026ldquo;His family was very rich, and he is the only heir. For the past five years, he has lived alone on this island, pursuing his only passion.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Computers?\u0026rdquo; Joy guessed.\n\u0026ldquo;Cuttlefish,\u0026rdquo; Annette explained. \u0026ldquo;He converted one of the out buildings on the island into an aquarium housing his prized collection of cuttlefish. He breeds them for aquariums all around the world, but he lets very few people onto his island.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why would he let us share his island?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;He is older than we are,\u0026rdquo; Annette indicated Brent and herself. \u0026ldquo;And he gets lonely. We are the only people he trusts, actually. I believe we can trust him, and he would be intrigued by the possibility of joining his friends.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, becoming a squid,\u0026rdquo; Mac scoffed. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s crazy. Besides, we don\u0026rsquo;t even know what will happen to us. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to risk becoming a squid. I\u0026rsquo;d rather just head for the beach and start swimming.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s dumb and you know it,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;We can barely make it through a day without collapsing. How are we going to swim, find food, and survive while these damn bugs have their way with our bodies? We need to be in a sheltered place while this fucking process either transforms us or kills us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why didn\u0026rsquo;t we drink any mermaid milk when we had the chance?\u0026rdquo; Mac complained.\n\u0026ldquo;Because we were going to try to make the major powers leave Mermaid Island alone,\u0026rdquo; Joy reminded him. \u0026ldquo;Now that they have a MAD device, we can try to make sure that you and I don\u0026rsquo;t die. Personally, a weekend on a private island on the Chesapeake sounds like a perfect vacation, if you get my drift, and I think we should go.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll call Jackson right now,\u0026rdquo; Annette said.\n\u0026ldquo;Do it,\u0026rdquo; Mac said as he groaned in pain, holding his left hip. \u0026ldquo;I feel like my bones are just crumbling within me. Godddaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmnnnnnnnnnn !\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pat was wrong about the microorganisms time-table,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;You guys don\u0026rsquo;t have weeks; you\u0026rsquo;ve got hours.\u0026rdquo;\nMalaki Dimaunahan looked at the thin, gaunt man standing in the middle of his office, looking for any reason to doubt the story he had just told. The small-framed man visibly shook in the presence of the rich and powerful head of the largest crime organization in the Philippines and Malaysia, but Malaki could see nothing but fear and truth in his eyes. He leaned forward and pressed a button on his desk phone.\n\u0026ldquo;Miss White, please have my son Torro sent to see me immediately,\u0026rdquo; he said into the speakerphone.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir,\u0026rdquo; the cultured, British voice answered.\nMalaki leaned back in his chair, looking out the bank of windows at the sky and view his office enjoyed. The 78th floor of the Petronas Towers commanded an impressive view of Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding countryside. He thought for a few minutes about the various clues he had before him.\nFirst, the old man claimed he was forced to be a courier for a smalltime drug gang, wanting money for the safe return of his personal secretary, Sudhish Basra, who was becoming something of a risk. The ransom amount was substantial, far beyond the normal asking price for an executive secretary to a businessman. Whoever had taken Sudhish, had a better understanding of his secretary\u0026rsquo;s real value than most of the small time drug gangs who performed these types of kidnappings as a sort of fundraiser.\nSecond, this man \u0026ldquo;Conjo\u0026rdquo; had worked in the building for years, a custodial worker working for the Petronas subsidiary servicing the needs of the clients, like himself, who occupied the second tower. The report he had called up on his computer showed that the fearful man had worked there for years, and there was every reason to believe that this shadowy and as yet unnamed rival gang had, in fact, used him as a blind mule.\nThird, Sudhish, despite his search for his sisters, which was understandable if regrettable, had otherwise been an important part of Malaki\u0026rsquo;s recent operations and had significant knowledge of his businesses, practices, and locations. Sudhish would be a valuable resource for such a gang, and could probably be induced to give his information for the price of finding his sisters. Damn!\n\u0026ldquo;Miss White,\u0026rdquo; he barked, punching the button.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir?\u0026rdquo; a voice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Confirm immediately with Kolkata that the Basra girls are still working at the Colonial House,\u0026rdquo; he ordered.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir!\u0026rdquo; the voice answered.\nMalaki\u0026rsquo;s face remained perfectly still as an internal rage swept through his mind. Bastards! If all this was true, that a rival organization was attempting to muscle in on his white slavery trade in the eastern territories, and had kidnapped Sudhish Basra, his most recent personal assistant, and tortured him for key bits of information, then Malaki\u0026rsquo;s business files and off-shore banking activities could be seriously compromised. Malaki decided on a test.\n\u0026ldquo;Is there any reason I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t throw you out from this tower?\u0026rdquo; Malaki asked Conjo who stood fearfully in his office.\n\u0026ldquo;Every reason, your excellency,\u0026rdquo; Conjo said in a quavering voice. \u0026ldquo;I am more useful to you alive than dead. Your enemies paid me to deliver this message, and if I am never seen again, they will know that you are afraid. If you send me back out, I will tell them that you laughed at me, and they will be afraid. I can try to tell you where they have a base of operations.\u0026rdquo;\nHa! Malaki thought to himself, his face remaining an unmoving mask. More likely that this small man would turn tail and run for safety. Actually, a tail on this thin man might lead to more information, he thought.\n\u0026ldquo;You have a point, especially since Mr. Basra is of very little use to me,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said in a honeyed voice. \u0026ldquo;If you will give me a minute?\u0026rdquo;\nConjo nodded, happy that this part of his plan seemed to be working.\nMalaki pushed another button on his phone. \u0026ldquo;Abdullah, bring me a Maumag. I have someone who needs a monkey on his back.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir,\u0026rdquo; the male voice answered.\n\u0026ldquo;I will let you go,\u0026rdquo; Malaki started, but held his hand up to silence Conjo as he started to thank him. \u0026ldquo;But, you will wear a small trinket that carries a powerful charm for bad luck. You will give this trinket to the men who hired you, yes?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes sir!\u0026rdquo; Conjo answered, delighted that Malaki obviously thought he was nothing but a country rube.\nHank watched as Pat and Phoebe salamandered back into the water, still tasting the delicious milk Pat had shared with him. Further down the beach, he spotted Galina and Petra joining them in the water, and he knew that Julie and Brian had also had their third feeding. His heart pounded in his chest, and wondered what would happen next. He knew something was going to happen, but Janice had given him no clue as to what to expect. He looked down over his naked body, enjoying the youthful energy and vitality he now felt.\n\u0026ldquo;You look better now than you did in college,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, emerging from the hut where she had drunk from Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;So do you,\u0026rdquo; he remarked, watching his now young looking wife walk towards him. All signs of aging had vanished. Her dark brown hair was longer, thicker, and shone with health. Her body was sleek and smooth, nut brown from the sun, and her breasts were high and firm, her brown nipples crinkling with excitement.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go up to the mountainside huts,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, holding out her hand to help him stand.\n\u0026ldquo;Are we \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Hank began.\n\u0026ldquo;No questions,\u0026rdquo; She admonished him. \u0026ldquo;That was part of the deal.\u0026rdquo;\nHank took her hand in his, and looked into her beautiful brown eyes. They were so big, he thought to himself, and now they looked just like they did back in college: big, intense, and filled with a whisper of innocence and a healthy dose of seduction. He squeezed her hand, feeling the same flutters of excitement he felt when they first met.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re in charge,\u0026rdquo; he said, as they began walkiing together up the mountain path.\nPat looked around the large sand bowl lying at the center of their lagoon. She remembered the day she and Danni first stayed in the water on their own, and the fantastic sex they had enjoyed. She looked down at her sea green tail, shimmering in the dappled light sparkling around her. Her pink fringes and fins were fluttering in the water, keeping her stationary as her daughter, Maureen, swam circles around her long tail. Never again would she have legs, she thought ruefully, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t think that she would ever really miss them.\nCynthia and Freya suddenly zipped towards her, joining their sister in a game of ring-a-round the mommy, and Pat, knowing Phoebe and Danni were close by, waited for them to appear. She sensed them just beyond the lip of the bowl, gathering food. She also sensed John, out beyond the barrier reef protecting their lagoon. He was with the other mermen, training James in the ways of mer-martial arts. Her pod-mates appeared at the rim of the bowl, swimming around a large elk coral, laden with food.\nPat admired, yet again, the beauty of her sister-wives swimming slowly towards her. Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s nearly white, blond hair flowing gracefully along the length of her back, her sea-blue tail undulating slowly as she made her way towards the lip of the sand bowl. Pat watched as Danni\u0026rsquo;s wide hips arced up towards the surface as she swam over the lip and headed down towards the spot where Pat waited. Her golden hair caught the sun\u0026rsquo;s light and flashed with electric highlights, matching the metallic, golden sheen of her long tail, pushing her along the sides of the sand bowl.\nDanni handed her an oyster, Pat effortlessly inserting a fingernail along one ruffled edge, and giving a quick twist. The sweet oyster opened with a snap, and Pat quickly ran her sharp nail along the edge where the muscle held the oyster tight to its iridescent home. She freed the body from the shell, lifted it up, sucking it into her mouth like a string of spaghetti. Ah, that was so good! The only reason to add lemon or hot sauce to an oyster, she thought to herself, was because landlubbers couldn\u0026rsquo;t get them fresh. The only absolutely fresh oyster you could have was the one you ate while still in the water.\nIt reminded of the first oyster she ever ate, when she was both a boy and a kid. On a family trip to Disney World, they tried their first \u0026ldquo;east coast\u0026rdquo; seafood dinner. The thick-shelled oysters in the Gulf of Mexico were not as sweet as the Japanese oysters native to this part of the Pacific, but were firmer and plumper, and she missed them. On the other hand, the Japanese Oysters living along the western arm of their lagoon weren\u0026rsquo;t as finicky as the Eastern Oysters she knew as a child, and tolerated the higher salinity of these waters. The small stream creating this estuarial lagoon wasn\u0026rsquo;t big enough to keep the salinity low enough for those Atlantic animals.\nPat looked down and laughed, watching Maureen struggle to open an oyster on her own. She reached down, quickly cracking open the shell and handing it back to her infant daughter. Maureen inelegantly pried the poor creature out from its shell, and shoved it into her mouth, chewing with her small teeth before swallowing it with a smile. All their kids had taken to eating adult food very quickly, though all of them still fed on mermaid milk as well.\nWhat was the appropriate length of time to nurse a mermaid child, Pat wondered. She knew she would never dry up, and so the decision to stop nursing was not one her body was going to dictate. She looked over at Phoebe who was now nursing Cynthia, and caught her eye.\n[How long do you think we will be nursing this brood?] She asked.\n[Huh, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t thought about it,] Phoebe admitted.\n[Exactly,] Pat agreed, gathering Maureen up into her arms, bringing her child\u0026rsquo;s lips to her own breast. [We are not going to dry up, I suspect, since our milk production is independent of our pregnancies.]\n[Perhaps they will let us know,] Danni offered, looking down at Freya as she suckled at her own, long nipples. [They\u0026rsquo;ll just not want to nurse any more.]\n[That is probably a very good plan,] Pat agreed. [Too bad we can\u0026rsquo;t let more things like that happen that way.]\n[Mother Nature always knows best,] Danni opined.\n[What are you worried about now?] Phoebe asked.\n[Hey, aren\u0026rsquo;t you supposed to be on CHEW rest?] Danni worried.\n[I\u0026rsquo;m fine, fully recovered,] Pat said. [REALLY, I am fine.]\n[Well?] Phoebe repeated.\n[We seem to be creating a new society here, and our organizational structure is primarily the pod,] Pat explained.\n[And?] Phoebe pressed.\n[That will probably be fine for a while, but complex organizations cannot be run like a family,] Pat said.\n[Why not?] Danni asked. [Our family gets along great.]\n[I know we do,] Pat agreed. [But imagine if we have over 100 mers here at Mermaid Island. That will happen someday. How will we insure that there is enough to eat? What will we build, now that we know that we can polymerize nearly any underwater structure we can imagine? Who will decide where those structures go? What happens to mers who cannot fit inside the Moon Pool for sleeping? Who will protect them from natural predators while they sleep? What about \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n[Alright, alright!] Danni said. [I get the picture. We have a lot of thinking to do, but why are we the ones who have to answer those questions?]\n[Because we are the ones who started it,] Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi Hank,\u0026rdquo; Julie said, her body seductively reclined on the bed Pat and John had first shared two and a half years ago.\nJohn had built a good bed, it was large and comfortable, and Julie looked like a painting as she laid upon the woven palm fronds. Her youth had been restored, and her compact body was firm and beautiful. Like her sister, Julie\u0026rsquo;s dark hair had grown longer, and her breasts had risen and become firmer. But on Julie\u0026rsquo;s shorter frame, the hourglass curves both girls possessed looked more dramatic on her. Hank\u0026rsquo;s penis twitched.\n\u0026ldquo;Where\u0026rsquo;s Brian?\u0026rdquo; Hank asked nervously, looking around the hut for his brother-in-law.\n\u0026ldquo;Not here,\u0026rdquo; Janice said as she pushed her husband into the hut. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just the three of us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But what \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;No questions!\u0026rdquo; Janice said, joining her sister on the bed and holding her arms out to him. \u0026ldquo;Come to bed and make love with us.\u0026rdquo;\nHank gazed down at the two lovely creatures who both beckoned to him. He knew that, on the one hand, to join them now was to start a journey ending in him losing his manhood. On the other hand, and this was the hand that his self-destructive penis was voting for, the woman whom he loved more than life itself was saying \u0026ldquo;Oh, god, please fuck me now,\u0026rdquo; and so was her sister. He wavered where he stood.\n\u0026ldquo;Hank,\u0026rdquo; Julie pleaded. \u0026ldquo;Please \u0026hellip; we want this, we want you. Join us. Please.\u0026rdquo;\nHank looked down, seeing the same look of love and desire in both of their faces. Their dark eyes were full of anticipation, and their bodies flushed with desire. There were a thousand questions he wanted to ask, rules to know about, and rules he wanted to dictate for himself. But his cock kept up its steady rise, and knew he could not refuse these two. Knowing he would be changed forever, but determined to be with Janice forever, he lowered himself onto the bed between the two women.\nThe three of them lay together for several minutes, both girls slowly and sensuously stroking his torso, his thighs, but never touching his cock. He was as hard as he could recall himself ever being, but held his body absolutely still, giving them complete control.\n\u0026ldquo;Relax,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;I love you, and I won\u0026rsquo;t let anything bad happen to you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Hank began.\nJulie leaned over and kissed him, snaking her tongue into his mouth. Her thick hair fell over his face, now smooth from the effects of the three feedings of mermaid milk they had all consumed over the last twenty-four hours. Both girls began to play with his cock, and when Julie broke off her kiss, Janice replaced her sister\u0026rsquo;s lips with her own. With a final nip, Janice broke off her kiss and gave Hank\u0026rsquo;s cock a good squeeze.\n\u0026ldquo;One last time,\u0026rdquo; Janice said.\n\u0026ldquo;Or one first time,\u0026rdquo; Julie said with a smile, leaning down to take Hank\u0026rsquo;s cock in her mouth.\nHank\u0026rsquo;s eyes rolled back in his head as he felt his sister-in-law\u0026rsquo;s warm mouth slide down his stiff cock. He moaned as she began to stroke his cock with both her mouth and her hand. He could feel his orgasm starting to rise quickly, spurred on by both Julie\u0026rsquo;s skill and by the incredible feelings of fear, anticipation, and uncertainty roaring through his brain. He felt breathlessly out of control, barely able to stop his body from running from the hut and yet unable to even raise his hands from the death grip he had on the bed. Janice began to kiss his neck and face.\n\u0026ldquo;Give it to her,\u0026rdquo; she hissed. \u0026ldquo;Let it go!\u0026rdquo;\nHank groaned again as Julie doubled her speed and efforts on his cock. His orgasm rose up with unexpected fury and force, and he shouted out as he spurted into Julie\u0026rsquo;s mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, again,\u0026rdquo; his wife whispered in his ear.\nAnd again, he groaned as his groin convulsed and pushed another hot stream into Julie\u0026rsquo;s mouth. His legs were stiff with the effort, and his hips lifted off the bed. Julie never broke her rhythm, her hand and lips a blur over his cock.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, again,\u0026rdquo; his wife whispered again.\nThis time, the knot at the base of his cock felt like molten metal, and it burned as it rose up through his cock and splashed into Julie\u0026rsquo;s mouth. He collapsed back onto the bed, his chest heaving with passion. Julie slid up his body and held her chin directly over his. Janice joined her, and together they kissed deeply, Hank\u0026rsquo;s cum dripping from their kiss onto his face and lips.\nHank had tasted his own cum on his wife\u0026rsquo;s lips before, so it didn\u0026rsquo;t surprise him. Both girls bent down and kissed and licked his face, forcing his mouth open and letting some of his own cum ooze into his mouth. After a few minutes, the three of them had kissed and licked each other clean.\nJulie turned, reached under the bed, and brought up a battered Russian canteen. She opened the container and lifted it up in a salute.\n\u0026ldquo;Cheers,\u0026rdquo; she said, and took a healthy swig. She handed it to her sister, who sat up, her breasts swaying as she rose.\n\u0026ldquo;To sisters and sister wives,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, and she took a long pull at the bottle. She held it out to Hank.\nHank too sat up, crossing his legs Indian style as he did. He stared at the bottle, and then looked at each girl. He looked around the hut, and still could not sense any one else\u0026rsquo;s presence. He looked back at the canteen, and peered into the opening. A pale, white liquid sloshed back and forth in the bottle, and the faint, sweet smell of mermaid milk filled his nose. He could detect another smell, but it was hard to separate it from the smell of his own cum lingering on his face. He knew what was in the canteen. It was the same mixture of mermaid milk and merman semen that had changed his son. He knew that he would be forever changed if he drank from it.\n\u0026ldquo;Janice, my love,\u0026rdquo; he whispered, his voice shaking with a fear that he was embarrassed that he could not control. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know my love,\u0026rdquo; she said gently, and handed the bottle back to her sister. \u0026ldquo;Come here,\u0026rdquo; she asked, indicating that he should lay his head down in her lap.\nHe turned onto his back and laid his head down in his wife\u0026rsquo;s lap. He could smell her arousal, that sweet/acrid smell of a woman. He looked up at her breasts, now gently swaying above his nose, and her small stiff brown nipples. She cradled his head, and lifted him up so that his lips came into contact with her nipple, and he closed his eyes and began to suck. Janice moaned her approval of his gentle suckling, but nothing came out of her breast.\nHank then noticed a slight taste of mermaid milk, and sucked a little harder.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s it, baby,\u0026rdquo; she urged. \u0026ldquo;Keep sucking.\u0026rdquo;\nHank felt more liquid ooze into his mouth, and he began to suck a little stronger. There was more liquid, and some of it was dribbling off her breast and onto his shoulder. He continued for several minutes, but the milk was never more than a trickle.\n\u0026ldquo;Enough, my love,\u0026rdquo; she said, letting his head fall away from her breast.\nHank looked up at his wife, and saw out of the corner of his eye, her sister putting the canteen down at the side of the bed. His stomach lurched as he realized that she had been dripping the contents of the canteen onto her sister\u0026rsquo;s breast, and he had drunk the powerful liquid. Janice recognized what Hank had concluded and pulled his face back to her breast.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t fight it,\u0026rdquo; she urged, her voice filled with emotion. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t move.\u0026rdquo;\nHank tried to force himself to relax, and he put his arms around his wife\u0026rsquo;s waist. He inventoried himself, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t find anything that felt different. Then he felt it; a slight tingling along the back of his throat, a tickle that ran up from his Adam\u0026rsquo;s apple up into his brain.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, nooo,\u0026rdquo; he cried softly.\n\u0026ldquo;Just breathe,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;Stay calm. Everything will be all right. I love you.\u0026rdquo;\nHank felt his stomach tighten again and bile rise up, burbling in his throat. He felt a wave of nausea sweep over him, and he rolled over to reach the side of the bed. He leaned over and felt a dry heave grip his abdomen, but his guts would not expel the liquid in his stomach. He rose up on his hands and knees, struggling to contain his nausea. Both girls scrambled to either side of him, and put their hands on his broad shoulders.\n\u0026ldquo;Easy,\u0026rdquo; Julie said. \u0026ldquo;Just breathe.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I love you,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, tears in her eyes as she watched the man she loved suffering this change for her.\nHank closed his eyes, and felt his stomach roll again in another dry heave, but nothing would come up. He was startled by the sound of a metal lid from one of the cooking pots drop onto the floor of the hut, ringing in the late morning sun. He realized that the girls had signaled Brian to emerge from his hiding place. He fell onto the bed and curled himself up into a ball, clutching at his stomach.\n\u0026ldquo;I love you,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, stroking his hair as he writhed on the bed. \u0026ldquo;Try to drink some more; it will help.\u0026rdquo; She moved in front of him, kneeling on the floor of the hut, trying to keep him calm.\nHank shook his head, fighting to contain his panic. He knew that his body was shaking for at least two reasons. First, whatever the siren cells were doing to his body was apparently causing him some discomfort, but secondly, and more importantly, the fear of what happening to him, to his body, threatened to overwhelm him. He barely heard Brain enter the room.\nJulie looked at her husband as he entered. Like the others, he was now youthful and strong, his thick brown hair a bit shaggier and shinier. He was even broader shouldered than he had been, thanks to her nearly constant focus on making him stronger and bigger than Hank. He truly was a handsome man, and she knew that Hank would eventually come to love him. He was carrying a stretcher under one arm. He put the stretcher against the wall and walked to the side of the bed facing away from Hank\u0026rsquo;s face. He stood there silent and unmoving.\nJulie reached down and picked up the canteen. She handed it over to Janice, who poured some of the liquid onto a soft cloth that she used to wipe Hank\u0026rsquo;s face, letting some of it dribble onto his lips. She kept doing this as Hank remained in a tight ball, his eyes clenched shut, his arms clutching at his stomach. After a few minutes, she looked up at Brian and nodded. Julie turned to her husband and began to stroke his cock.\n\u0026ldquo;Just keep breathing,\u0026rdquo; Janice said as she continued to keep Hank\u0026rsquo;s face damp with the mixture. \u0026ldquo;Everything will be alright in a few minutes.\u0026rdquo;\nBrian looked down on his beautiful wife as she took his cock into her mouth. He looked over at his equally beautiful sister-in-law and his soon-to-be pod-mate. Then he looked down at Hank\u0026rsquo;s back, and started to visualize Hank as a female version of himself. As his wife\u0026rsquo;s efforts on his own cock increased, he felt a sense of power surge through his body. He narrowed his eyes, and bore into Hank\u0026rsquo;s back, willing it to change into a long, slender, female back like Hank\u0026rsquo;s daughter\u0026rsquo;s, Kate and Ann. Just like Rose had favored Janice and Julie, Kate and Ann would inform how Hank would change.\nHank felt the tingling in his head grow stronger, and his sense of panic began to subside. He could feel the power of the siren cells he had already consumed be summoned to a new duty, and slowly his body started to relax. He heard Brian groan behind him, and knew that soon he would have to face him, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring himself to move. Janice dribbled more of the mixture onto his lips, and he couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but lick the moisture from them. He felt Julie scramble from the bed and come around to join Janice on the floor in front of him. He cracked open on eye, and saw that they were kissing. Janice then turned to him, and took his face in her hands, and lowered her face to kiss him.\nHe tasted another man\u0026rsquo;s cum for the first time as Janice\u0026rsquo;s tongue gently forced its way into his mouth. His saliva gushed as the foreign liquid entered, and he reflexively swallowed. Janice\u0026rsquo;s lips left his and then Julie\u0026rsquo;s replaced them. Her kiss was stronger, more forceful, and there was more of Brian\u0026rsquo;s cum on her lips and tongue. He reflexively swallowed again. When Julie broke her kiss, Hank felt his entire body suddenly relax, as though a great pin had punctured all the fear and uncertainty he had felt. He blinked a few times, breathing gently, looking at the two women who peered compassionately at him.\nHe raised one hand from his stomach, and reached for the canteen in Janice\u0026rsquo;s hand. She gave it to him and smiled. Without turning around, Hank lifted himself up on his other elbow, keeping his back to Brian, and brought the canteen to his lips. He gave a small sigh of resignation, and drank the remaining contents of the canteen. When he finished, he wiped his lips, and handed the container back to his wife.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s my name?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Jaclyn,\u0026rdquo; she answered. \u0026ldquo;I love you, Jaclyn.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I love you too, Jaclyn,\u0026rdquo; Julie said.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m working on it,\u0026rdquo; a deep voice from behind him/her said.\n\u0026ldquo;Two more days,\u0026rdquo; Michael Thompson confirmed as he looked at his three future pod-mates who were seated around the small galley table of the Johanna. \u0026ldquo;We will assemble at this point,\u0026rdquo; he put his finger at a blank spot in the ocean, about ten nautical miles east of Davao, \u0026ldquo;and finalize the plans for the rescue mission.\u0026rdquo;\nLeonard stared at the point on the map indicated by Michael\u0026rsquo;s finger, wondering what it would be like to meet an actual mermaid. He didn\u0026rsquo;t think at all about the dangers he may face in going to a backwater, sometimes lawless, part of the world to pluck several prostitutes away from pimps who might not want them to take their property away from them. He could only think about meeting the mermaids.\n\u0026ldquo;Len?\u0026rdquo; the wiry old man sitting next to him prompted.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry, Peter,\u0026rdquo; Len said, realizing that he was still holding the creamer for the coffee Peter hoped to drink. He passed the creamer over to the former scientist, and wondered what kind of mermaid Peter would make.\nOver the last several days, the four of them had gotten to know one another quite well, and while no one had pressed him on the issue of gender change, Peter LaMond had made it quite clear he was looking forward to becoming a woman. A life-long loner, he had a successful carreer as a chemical engineer, but secretly he wanted to be a girl since he was a little boy. He never told anyone, however, not even his late wife. The only person he had ever told was his young cousin, Johanna Thompson. That improbable event had lead to his presence on the boat named for his cousin, and he couldn\u0026rsquo;t be happier.\nLen, on the other hand, hadn\u0026rsquo;t so much as sought out this place on Michael\u0026rsquo;s boat as had been accidentally thrust into it. He watched Peter drink his coffee and wondered if coffee played a role in the mers' lives. How much would he be giving up, he wondered. He shook his head. How much would he be gaining, he reminded himself. Long life, a feeling of belonging, and a great and grand adventure to complete a fantasy he had since he was a little boy.\nHe sipped his coffee and looked again at the map on the table. The ocean was so big, so enormous. As mers they could go anywhere, and they could do it on their own schedules, their own agendas. Well, they would have to keep themselves a secret. Len shuddered when he thought about what the world might do to them if they were discovered. Would the whole world want to become mers? God, that would ruin the whole appeal, as far as Len was concerned.\nHe looked up at Peter, Liz, and Michael. What kind of pod would they become? Liz looked like she had been a beautiful woman despite her handicap. She would make a strong willed and beautiful mermaid. But he and Peter; Len could not begin to think what kind of mermaid Peter or himself would become.\n\u0026ldquo;Do the mers drink coffee?\u0026rdquo; Len asked no one in particular.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think so,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never thought to ask. Perhaps later today when we radio in to Mermaid Island?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, no,\u0026rdquo; Len said, embarrassed he had said anything aloud. \u0026ldquo;I was just wondering. Don\u0026rsquo;t waste precious time with \u0026hellip; what\u0026rsquo;s her name?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pat,\u0026rdquo; Michael answered. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s the head mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They have a head?\u0026rdquo; Len asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, she\u0026rsquo;s the one who generally is the one who talks to me on the radio,\u0026rdquo; Michael answered. \u0026ldquo;They don\u0026rsquo;t talk about who is in charge. I think we\u0026rsquo;ll learn a lot when we meet the others.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How many mers are there?\u0026rdquo; Len asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not quite sure,\u0026rdquo; Michael answered. \u0026ldquo;We are meeting twelve, and there are at least that many still on Mermaid Island. So, may be twenty or thirty so far. I really don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But we will still be among the first,\u0026rdquo; Len observed.\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;Why would that be important?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I was just wondering what everyone did, you know, to fill the time,\u0026rdquo; Len said.\n\u0026ldquo;What has that got to do with being among the first?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;m a lawyer by trade, Peter is a chemical engineer, Michael is a businessman, and you are a philanthropist,\u0026rdquo; Len explained. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s possible that each of us has important things we can contribute to this new society, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, I think I understand,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;I think that you are going to be the first lawyer mermaid. You\u0026rsquo;ll have a lot to contribute.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t I be a merman?\u0026rdquo; Len asked. \u0026ldquo;I mean, why is that just the assumption, that I will be a mermaid?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not an assumption,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;It just makes sense to me, that\u0026rsquo;s all. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to change with us, you know. Maybe you can start a pod of your own with the prostitutes we are rescuing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think so?\u0026rdquo; Len asked, not really sure how he felt about it.\n\u0026ldquo;The future is full of boundless possibilities,\u0026rdquo; Michael said with a warm smile. \u0026ldquo;I would like my old friend to be a member of my own pod, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dream of forcing you into anything you didn\u0026rsquo;t want.\u0026rdquo;\nLen looked at Michael closely, surprised by the warm feeling of tenderness he felt. Why did Michael look so damned attractive, and why didn\u0026rsquo;t he feel like he should immediately reject the notion of becoming a mermaid rather than a merman? Len closed his eyes and thought about all the things he was feeling.\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, Michael,\u0026rdquo; he said after a moment. \u0026ldquo;You have always been a good friend. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep that in mind.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Michael agreed. \u0026ldquo;Now, let\u0026rsquo;s get this boat ship-shape for the next few days.\u0026rdquo;\nJacyln\u0026rsquo;s stomach flipped a little bit as she heard Brian\u0026rsquo;s voice behind her. Yes, she thought to herself, she was a she now, whether she liked it or not. Her body was still very much male, but the tickle in her head had done its work, and there was no turning back now.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m working on it,\u0026rdquo; he had said, and the deep rumble of his baritone had sent an involuntary thrill through her body. Jaclyn closed her eyes, feeling the heat of Brian\u0026rsquo;s gaze upon her still male back for the first time. She shuddered, knowing that his presence was shaping her, morphing her, changing her body into something new, something she had never known nor sought to know.\n\u0026ldquo;Jaci?\u0026rdquo; his former wife asked, using the hard c sound, \u0026ldquo;can you sit up? We really should get to the hot tub.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Jaci?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn repeated, listening to the sound of the nickname his wife, now sister-wife, had chosen for him/her.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, what do you prefer?\u0026rdquo; Julie asked. \u0026ldquo;Brian calls me Jules, you know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No one calls me Jan,\u0026rdquo; Janice quipped.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank god you didn\u0026rsquo;t want to call me Marsha,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;I think I would like to keep it Jaclyn for now, though Janice can call me anything she likes. I want that to be special for a little while longer, you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course,\u0026rdquo; Julie answered. \u0026ldquo;I think that I would like the same thing, that only Brian calls me Jules. It makes a certain amount of sense to me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks for understanding,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;I think I can get up now.\u0026rdquo;\nJaclyn swung her still male legs over the side of the bed and stood up between the two women. Then slowly, she turned around. Brian watched as the newly named Jaclyn turned around, moving with a fluidity that Hank never had. Her journey was already starting, and Brian felt the sense of power he had, build to even higher levels. As he looked at Hank/Jaclyn, Brian felt powerful, strong, and so very male. He was looking forward to making all three of these women adore him. He spread his legs, letting his still stiff cock point at the three ladies, well \u0026hellip; two ladies and one sort of lady. He put his hands on his hips and tightened his muscles in what he hoped was a sexy pose.\nJaclyn hid a smirk from her face with her hand, and noticed that Brian assumed she was blushing. She cast a sideways glance at Janice, and saw that they both shared the same conclusion. She received an elbow from Julie on her left, and redoubled her efforts to stifle a giggle. A new wave of nausea swept up from her gut, not from fear, but from the now speeded up changes coursing through her body. She staggered forward and put hand onto the bed to steady herself.\n\u0026ldquo;Now do you understand why we asked you to bring the stretcher?\u0026rdquo; Julie asked. \u0026ldquo;Quick, let\u0026rsquo;s get her up to the hot tub. We added some stuff to the water to help Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s change.\u0026rdquo;\nBrian responded instantly to Julie\u0026rsquo;s request, turning to get the stretcher. He laid it down on the bed, and reached to help Jaclyn lay her still broad shoulders down onto the canvas covered frame. Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s shoulder burned where Brian had touched her, and could tell every contact was speeding her change. She groaned as a fresh wave of nausea rose up.\n\u0026ldquo;Hurry,\u0026rdquo; Janice urged.\nThe two girls picked up the end of the stretcher by Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s feet, while Brian took the heavier (for now) upper torso. The three of them picked Jaclyn up, worked their way out of the narrow door, and headed up along the jungle path towards the mountainside hut tub. In a few minutes they reached their destination, Jaclyn barely keeping herself from throwing up along the way. They swung the stretcher around so that Brian could back his way into the water, still holding the stretcher, and gently lowering her into the water.\nJaclyn felt the warm water caress her shoulders and felt the girls drop their end of the stretcher as soon as it hit the water. They clambered into the water on either side of him/her and supported her head and shoulders while Brian took the stretcher from the water and tossed it off to one side. All four of them were now in the hot tub, with Janice, Julie, and Brian surrounding Jaclyn.\nJaclyn lay peacefully on her back in the warm and gently bubbling water. The sky above was clear and blue, the mid-day sun beating down upon them. The water felt a little warmer than she liked, but then she supposed it could also be that the siren cells were hard at work in her body, metabolizing her own cells and rebuilding them into a new configuration. She felt Brian take a hold of her feet, and recognized that she was being held by all three of her new pod-mates. They remained silent, all of them focusing on the changes they were guiding in Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s body.\nAfter many minutes of simply being together, the wave of pressures causing the initial feelings of nausea gave way to a different kind of pressure. Jaclyn could feel the bubbles around her body grow more intense, and it felt as if she was floating on a cushion of bubbles.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s happening?\u0026rdquo; she asked, surprised at how ragged her own voice sounded, halfway between a male voice and a female one.\n\u0026ldquo;Pat gave me some new microorganisms to put into this hot tub,\u0026rdquo; Janice explained. \u0026ldquo;They are the ones primarily concerned with changes in body mass and type, not species change. None of these microorganisms are the ones that carry the siren cell virus, so it should not cause a merchange to occur, only assist in a gender change. You, my darling, are the first to enjoy this benefit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What does that mean?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn asked.\n\u0026ldquo;That your primary transformation into my sister-wife should take a few minutes rather than a few hours, like Rose\u0026rsquo;s,\u0026rdquo; Janice explained. \u0026ldquo;We also hope that the colony of microorganisms we start here will become healing agents for those who are not going to become mers, but Pat says that there will be many more experiments to undertake before that can happen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are you going to make me look like?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn asked, feeling the energies stored up by the several feedings and the new microorganisms beginning to build up throughout her body.\n\u0026ldquo;Like our daughters,\u0026rdquo; Janice explained, kissing him. \u0026ldquo;You are still one of their parents, though now you\u0026rsquo;ll be more like a mother than a father to them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ohhhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn moaned.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Bones \u0026hellip; hurt,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn gasped, feeling nearly every bone in her body being crunched into a smaller female configuration.\n\u0026ldquo;Not as short, remember?\u0026rdquo; Julie said to Brian. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s going to be a tall mermaid, not as short as her daughters.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right, sorry,\u0026rdquo; Brian said, refocusing his mind on the task Julie and Janice were ordering him to follow. It was hard to get Kate and Ann\u0026rsquo;s lovely figures separated from how tall Hank had been in comparison. He tried to focus only on things like shoulders, hips, and waists, but legs, arms, and torsos made their way into his internal fantasy.\nJaclyn felt some of the pressure lessen and the water continued to roil around her. She turned her head, feeling a new drag on her movements. Her hair must be growing at an astounding rate. She looked up at Janice and saw her sister-wife was looking at her with a radiance of love and compassion and gratitude never seen in her eyes when she was Hank.\n\u0026ldquo;I love you,\u0026rdquo; she struggled to say through lips and a face that felt like thick soup rather than flesh. \u0026ldquo;Tell me what\u0026rsquo;s happening,\u0026rdquo; she managed to force out through her changing bones and flesh.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my beautiful Jaclyn,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, her eyes wet with emotion, her face damp with the fine mist rising from the bubbling and roiling waters. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re changing so quickly, and you\u0026rsquo;re already so beautiful.\u0026rdquo;\nJaclyn could feel confirmations of Janice\u0026rsquo;s observations throughout her body. She suspected the siren cells and the new microorganisms were both consuming some of her own biomass to energize this quick change and expelling any excess biomass from her body. She didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any pain now, but could still feel bones shifting, stretching, shrinking, and changing. Her head felt lighter, and she supposed it was smaller. Her lower torso felt heavier, and knew that her hips had expanded, as had her ass. Brian\u0026rsquo;s grip on her feet had shifted to her calves, which separated her legs slightly, her feet now resting on either side of his hips. The thought of what that meant both terrified and excited her.\n\u0026ldquo;Your penis is gone,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, confirming what Jaclyn could feel already. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a few inches shorter than you used to be, but not much. You\u0026rsquo;ll probably be the tallest mermaid we have. Your waist is so small, I hope it didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said, feeling her body rushing to accept its new shape, her face finally feeling less like putty and more like a face. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s happening really quickly; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt very much at all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m so glad,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;I was so worried, and so happy when Pat asked us to test out this new process.\u0026rdquo;\nJaclyn felt Brian move his hands to behind her kneecaps, forcing her legs wider apart still. Her body now felt very feminine, her long, shapely and now very smooth legs resting gently along Brian\u0026rsquo;s waist, her wide hips floating along the surface of the water, the bubbles teasing her crotch where she could feel her vagina still forming, her internal organs still moving around. Everywhere the thousands of tiny bubbles caressed her newly soft skin.\nSuddenly she felt Julie and Janice each latch on to one of her nipples and begin to suck. The pleasure their sucking sparked laced through her body, causing her to arch her back, letting her hips sink into the water. The harder they tugged, the more it seemed her nipples began to grow, until she could clearly feel the large nubs her nipples had become being manipulated by their teeth and tongue.\nThe feelings were exquisite! Beneath those nipples she felt the siren cells push more of her own biomass up from her waist and into her breasts. With each passing second, a throbbing wave of pleasure increased in her chest as her breasts grew under the gentle manipulation of her sister wives. A secondary throbbing filled her crotch as her womb finished forming, her labia becoming swollen with the passions she felt running through her now changed body. Finally, the girls stopped sucking and stood up to see the results of their handiwork.\nJanice looked down on her new sister wife, amazed at the beauty floating in the water beneath her. Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s wheat blond hair now spread out like a fan from her face, stretching out nearly a meter in every direction. Her blue eyes were enormous, generous pools of light, flashing azure, cyan, and cobalt around a coal back pupil. Her long, honey blond lashes curled away from her wide, innocent eyes. Her face was long with gracefully arched eyebrows, dramatic cheekbones, and wide, generous lips. Her neck was long and slender, giving way to still wide shoulders. Her arms too were slender and long, and the hand Janice now grasped in her own was beautiful. Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s fingers were long and topped with strong nails, now in need of some attention, being so new, they had not grown in evenly. She could also see the Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s index finger was longer than her ring finger, just like hers was.\nBelow her graceful but powerful shoulders rose two enormous breasts, much bigger than either hers or Julie\u0026rsquo;s. They sat up cone shaped from her recumbent torso, still firm and high. At the center of each mound was a medium sized areola that was itself gently domed, with a large, thick nipple at its center. Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s nipples were larger than either hers or Julie\u0026rsquo;s, and they mesmerized Janice. From her up thrust breasts, Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s waist dramatically narrowed, accentuated by her long torso, before flaring out into wide hips, again wider than Janice\u0026rsquo;s or Julie\u0026rsquo;s. Between her shapely thighs was nestled the puffy lips of a vagina, but there was no hair to be seen anywhere on her body except for her head and eyes. Janice followed Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s body downward, seeing how Brian had positioned himself between her legs, his stiff cock pointed at her newly formed crotch.\nBrian felt Janice\u0026rsquo;s eyes on his cock, and he looked up at his new sister wife. He felt relieved when Janice smiled back at him, gently encouraging the next step in their plan. He looked down at the now finished Jaclyn, admiring her lush body in all its glory. His cock felt painfully hard, and he hoped that Julie didn\u0026rsquo;t yet have enough of a merbond with him to sense how much he wanted this amazing creature that even now smiled back up at him.\nSomething clicked inside Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s brain, and suddenly she understood how and why Janice and Julie had arranged everything as they had, and she was grateful for their understanding, kindness, and foresight. She gave Janice\u0026rsquo;s hand a squeeze and knew that her sister-wife understood all those thoughts at once. She looked up at Brian and saw his slackjawed stare for the first time. Poor thing, she thought. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t even know how much power I\u0026rsquo;ve gained. She looked back at her new sisters, and they all nodded silently.\n\u0026ldquo;Brian?\u0026rdquo; she asked in her new, seductive, alto voice. \u0026ldquo;How\u0026rsquo;d I turn out?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhh \u0026hellip; ummm,\u0026rdquo; he stammered, overwhelmed by the sparkle of life in Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s eyes, and the charisma and raw sexuality flowing from them. She blinked at him, and suddenly he worried his cock might simply explode off his body.\n\u0026ldquo;You like, old friend?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn asked, enjoying the way she was making both him and herself feel.\nShe could feel her nipples tighten with excitement. She knew what a beautiful pair of breasts could do to a man, so let go of Janice\u0026rsquo;s hand, and slid both hands up to her new mounds, cupping them and feeling their weight. She felt both Janice and Julie move their hands under her shoulders, supporting her weight in the water, allowing her the leverage she needed for her next move.\nShe looked up at Brian, seeing the need and lust in his eyes, enjoying the sweep of his eyes up and down her body. She lifted her calves a little and then crossed her ankles together behind his ass, forcing his hips closer to her own. His cock jutted out over her stomach, a few centimeters above the water, while she pressed her hips into his thighs, rocking her hips back and forth.\n\u0026ldquo;Julie, I\u0026rsquo;m so glad you decided to share,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;Look what a wonderful cock he has, it nearly reaches my belly button.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god yes,\u0026rdquo; Julie breathed, taken up by the incredibly sensual sight of her former brother-in-law teasing her husband, now pod-mate to all three of them. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;d better share with me, as well,\u0026rdquo; Julie said, putting on hand on Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s breast, feeling the hard, thick nipple press into her palm.\n\u0026ldquo;I have a feeling we\u0026rsquo;re going to get along just fine,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;Right my darling?\u0026rdquo; she asked, turning to face Janice.\nJanice said nothing and lowered her head to kiss her beautiful sisterwife. Their mouths opened, full female lips sliding across one another\u0026rsquo;s for the first time, Janice remembering her fantasies about her college roommate so many years ago. Jaclyn was every fantasy she ever had completely and excellently fulfilled. They broke the kiss, and Jaclyn moved her hips with greater urgency, making the water splash between her and Brian.\n\u0026ldquo;Julie, would you do the honors?\u0026rdquo; she asked, her voice heavy with lust.\nJulie took her hand from Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s breast and reached down to grasp her husband\u0026rsquo;s long, stiff cock, a newly enlarged cock she had enjoyed earlier the previous evening while they listened to Hank and Janice make love. She knew from experience what a lovely feeling that long cock would cause, and her own vagina began to flower in anticipation of being next. She waited as Jaclyn used the grip Brian had on her thighs to leverage her heels higher on his back, and then watched as she lifted her hips out from the water so that they were even with Brian\u0026rsquo;s waiting cock.\nJaclyn\u0026rsquo;s body was on fire. She felt the blossoming of a void within her womb create a delicious need to fill that void. She waited until she felt Julie place Brian\u0026rsquo;s cock at the entrance to her sex, and then tightened her strong thighs and calves, forcing his cock deep inside her. She gasped with delight and some pain as his cock slid past her brand new hymen, and bottomed out within her.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes!\u0026rdquo; she gasped, feeling the tip of his penis rub on her cervix. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t feel her cervix, only the internal pressure this cock caused by moving within her. She was nearly overwhelmed, however, by the new sensations emanating from her vulva and new clitoris. She tightened her legs around Brian\u0026rsquo;s lower back, tilting her hips forward, and forced her clitoris to make contact with his body.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhhhhhhhh!\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn screamed, the pressure on her sensitive nub of flesh sending waves of sensation through her body, feeling her new muscles in her birth canal begin grabbing at Brian\u0026rsquo;s thick cock. Her body took over, and her hips starting rocking up and down, forcing Brian\u0026rsquo;s cock deep within her, pushing his cock back and forth across her G-spot.\n\u0026ldquo;OH, GOD!\u0026rdquo; she shouted, using her legs to lift her body out of the water, wrapping her arms around Brian\u0026rsquo;s shoulders as she rose up, pressing her body into his. Her hips were now a blur, as the vibrating waves of her first orgasm caused her hips to pulsate quickly over his, forcing his cock to beat the sides of her womb like a jackhammer.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,\u0026rdquo; she screamed like a barking dog, feeling her new breasts shake as her body quaked like a leaf in a thunderstorm in the throes of the greatest feeling of pleasure she had ever known.\nBrian was completely unprepared for the force of Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s passion, and stood rock still trying to keep both of them from falling over into the water. Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s body was like warm, quivering, jelly as her orgasm forced her hips to piston back and forth on his cock. He could feel her birth canal clamping down on his cock, holding it so tight that it felt like she might pull it out at the root. Without warning, his cock erupted, and he groaned out in passion, his knees buckling as they both sank back into the hot tub.\nJanice and Julie guided the sinking lovers down, supporting them as Jaclyn still hammered away at Brian\u0026rsquo;s cock, her constant cries of passion growing in volume. Her hips pulsed like an electric toothbrush, vibrating on his now spurting cock. She could feel each twitch of his stomach muscles as each spurt rocketed into her hungry vagina. Her orgasm continued to blossom, never lessening, for a full minute, though it seemed an eternity, and then finally, it released her, and she collapsed into Brian\u0026rsquo;s shoulder.\nThe two lovers slowly recovered, feeling the supportive hands of their two sister wives holding them and stroking them. When her breathing returned to something closer to normal, Jaclyn lifted her head and looked at her new pod-mate. Brian\u0026rsquo;s eyes were shining in surprise, and she felt his still hard cock within her. She leaned forward and kissed him, tasting his mouth for the first time. She liked the way he tasted, she decided, but knew that Janice would hold for her a special bond for all time. She leaned back and turned to her former wife, and kissed her. She felt Julie press in on her other side and kiss Brian.\n\u0026ldquo;When are we supposed to go down?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn asked as she broke the kiss with Janice.\n\u0026ldquo;As soon as we\u0026rsquo;re ready,\u0026rdquo; Janice said.\n\u0026ldquo;You two ready?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn asked Brian and Julie, interrupting their kiss.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Julie said, her chest heaving with passion. \u0026ldquo;That was the most incredible thing I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen, but the next time that cock goes anywhere, it will be in my mermaid\u0026rsquo;s womb.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a deal,\u0026rdquo; Brian agreed, as he slipped out from Jaclyn. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\u0026rdquo;\nJanice pulled at Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s hand, signaling her to wait, and together they watched as Julie and Brain rose from the tub, their beautiful bodies dripping with water, their skin shining in the sun.\n\u0026ldquo;You coming?\u0026rdquo; Julie asked, noticing that the other two had stayed behind.\n\u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you two get the huts presentable for Harold. We left everything something of a mess,\u0026rdquo; Janice said.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right,\u0026rdquo; Julie said, remembering more of the details the plan she and her sister had worked out. \u0026ldquo;Come on Brian, let\u0026rsquo;s let these two have some time to adjust to their new roles, and we can sort out the last of those explosives Harold was working on.\u0026rdquo; She grabbed his hand and started back down the path. Brian gave one last look at the two beautiful women in the hot tub, and then followed his wife back down the path.\n\u0026ldquo;How do you feel?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;How do I look?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn countered, her broad smile making visible how she felt.\n\u0026ldquo;Probably as good as you feel,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, turning their bodies so that they faced one another. \u0026ldquo;Do you understand, now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why you wanted this?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn confirmed, sweeping her gaze down her own impressive body. Janice nodded, waiting.\n\u0026ldquo;I think so,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said, thinking aloud. \u0026ldquo;I was afraid at first, I admit that. But once I saw how the look in Brian\u0026rsquo;s eye had changed, I understood what it means to actually be a beautiful woman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re literally the combined fantasy of Julie, Brian, and myself,\u0026rdquo; Janice agreed. \u0026ldquo;How could we not look upon you and not feel a bit helpless?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t feel helpless around anyone,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn teased. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re still the most beautiful woman I know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You haven\u0026rsquo;t seen a mirror,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;But I know you love me, and I can feel it much the same way I did before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How so?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn asked. \u0026ldquo;I feel very differently about you now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, but you\u0026rsquo;re a woman now,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;Before you wanted me as a man. Now how do you feel?\u0026rdquo;\nJaclyn looked down at her former wife, noting that she was still taller than Janice. She looked at her eyes, and saw there the same look of desire, no \u0026hellip; a stronger look of desire than she had ever seen before. She felt her own breasts tighten again, even though she had only moments ago careened through the most amazing orgasm she had ever felt. She knew her body was ready to go, without a rest, and indeed, that she wanted to hold Janice and feel her body quake just like she used to. No, not just like she used to \u0026hellip; it was different.\n\u0026ldquo;We can share it now,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said, her eyes shining.\n\u0026ldquo;We can share everything now,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, reaching up to bring Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s lips to her own.\nThey kissed for many minutes, two beautiful women, standing in a low hot tub, perched on the side of a picturesque mountain in the south Pacific. Janice slowly guided them into the center of the pool, to a place where there was a slight depression. She guided Jaclyn to that small bowl, and guided her feet into it. Jaclyn was delighted to discover that now they were the same height, and that their breasts were now pressing into one another\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;I love my new body,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said as she lifted her head and watched as they pushed their breasts together. \u0026ldquo;My nipples are so sensitive, ah \u0026hellip; ah,\u0026rdquo; she shuddered as Janice\u0026rsquo;s stiff nipple caught on one of hers. \u0026ldquo;That feels so delicious.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Janice breathed, as she reached around Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s tiny waist and pulled her body towards hers. \u0026ldquo;It gets better,\u0026rdquo; she said as she pressed her lips back onto Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s.\nThey continued to kiss, rubbing the length of their bodies across one another\u0026rsquo;s. Jaclyn felt one of Janice\u0026rsquo;s hands fall to her hips, and the trace its way toward her crotch. Jaclyn matched her sister-wife\u0026rsquo;s movements, and soon they both found themselves pressed together, kissing, while their hands rubbed furiously at one another\u0026rsquo;s clitoris\u0026rsquo;s.\nJaclyn felt her body prepare for her second orgasm, and she tried to concentrate on Janice\u0026rsquo;s body. Both of their hips were underwater, but Jaclyn could still feel a warm wetness oozing around her fingers as they flicked across Janice\u0026rsquo;s clit. Janice pulled away from the kiss, gasping for breath, her own fingers growing jerky and random at Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s crotch.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my darling, yes,\u0026rdquo; she urged. \u0026ldquo;Right there, oh GOD!\u0026rdquo; Janice cried as her orgasm caused her to have a spasm against Jaclyn. Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s body responded as if triggered by an explosion, her hips thrusting against Janice\u0026rsquo;s hand as her body took over.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yesssssssssssssss,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn cried as her second orgasm washed over her. \u0026ldquo;So good, so good, so good,\u0026rdquo; she repeated, her body riding the crest of her orgasm for another minute, still keeping her own fingers moving over Janice\u0026rsquo;s quivering vagina.\nAfter several minutes, they both recovered, but they stayed entwined in the pool, stroking each other\u0026rsquo;s breasts, neck, and shoulders lightly, and kissing softly and gently.\n\u0026ldquo;Now how do you feel?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Completely in love,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn admitted, feeling the whispers of the proto-mer bonds beginning to form.\n\u0026ldquo;What about Brian?\u0026rdquo; Janice asked.\n\u0026ldquo;What about Brian?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you love him?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not that I don\u0026rsquo;t love him, I mean, he just fucked me. Wow, did you hear that?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;And it looked like you were having a great time. And then, we made love ourselves. Did it feel the same?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, each felt different,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;I feel different with you. I know I am in love with you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That will change,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;You know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No it won\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said, kissing her sister-wife again. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll always feel slightly differently about you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, I mean that eventually we will both love him,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;We won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, that,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn agreed. \u0026ldquo;Yes, I know,\u0026rdquo; she said as she turned and gracefully lifted herself out of the tub.\n\u0026ldquo;And?\u0026rdquo; Janice prompted, holding up her hand to the Amazon beauty before her.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s going to be fine,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said, pulling Janice from the tub. \u0026ldquo;As long as I always have your love first and foremost.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Count on it,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, smacking her lover\u0026rsquo;s shapely and full ass as she kissed her.\nThe afternoon sun cascaded down the rock chimney, flooding the Moon Pool with light. A tall blond stood on the side of the pool, holding hands with a shorter, but still tall brunette. Behind them, a group of six mermen and two mermaids watched over a jumble of sleeping, infant mermaids. In the pool below, a new merman was born, his steel gray and green tail echoing his older brother\u0026rsquo;s, who was currently helping Danni arrange their mermaid children in their sleep.\n\u0026ldquo;Is he done yet?\u0026rdquo; John asked over his shoulder, sensing a change in the energy coming from the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Janice reported, reaching up to make sure her tiara was firmly in her hair. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re almost ready to go.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You two alright?\u0026rdquo; John asked as he salamandered past Liga.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we\u0026rsquo;re fine,\u0026rdquo; Liga said, putting Buan next to Mari, both of whom were asleep. \u0026ldquo;You go into the water. Danni will join you as soon as we have all of the baby girls safe and sound.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; John agreed, and flipped his tail so he cleared nearly three meters of rocky cave floor and sailed into the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;Show off,\u0026rdquo; Bill complained as he slid back into the water.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Jaclyn, right?\u0026rdquo; Trevor asked as he salamandered up to the two human girls. The tall blond nodded. \u0026ldquo;Wow, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to tell me about it later.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think you can learn everything you need to from my daughter Rose,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said, smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said. \u0026ldquo;I know a lot more about Hank\u0026rsquo;s past than Robbie\u0026rsquo;s,\u0026rdquo; he teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Which you\u0026rsquo;ll take to your grave,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said as she swatted at the broad shouldered merman.\nTrevor ducked and slipped into the water, chuckling loudly. The rest of the mermen followed him.\n\u0026ldquo;You ready?\u0026rdquo; Julie asked, rising from the water on her new tail, her brown eyes now gleaming with the multi-faceted streaks of mermaid\u0026rsquo;s rods and cones.\nJaclyn and Janice nodded, looking at Julie\u0026rsquo;s new powerful tail. She had gone first, then Brian so that Julie could be his only influence. Brian rose up beside her, his long black hair now down to his shoulders, hydrophobic-ally dry the moment he left the water, his strong, dark tail flashing in the brightly lit water.\n\u0026ldquo;Pat\u0026rsquo;s ready,\u0026rdquo; Brian reported, signaling that everything was ready for this dual transformation. \u0026ldquo;You both remember you only to go to two or three moms; don\u0026rsquo;t try to feed off of too many mermaids before you come to Julie and I.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yes, dear,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said, smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not going to lie,\u0026rdquo; Brian said, smiling at Julie. \u0026ldquo;Hearing that from him \u0026hellip; er \u0026hellip; her will take some getting used to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a lot you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to get used to,\u0026rdquo; Julie said, kissing her pod-mate. \u0026ldquo;Our transition was beautiful,\u0026rdquo; she told her sister wives. \u0026ldquo;The tiara\u0026rsquo;s really help.\u0026rdquo;\nPat broke the surface and looked up at Jaclyn and Janice. \u0026ldquo;Give us just another minute. We\u0026rsquo;ve got a wonky sensor.\u0026rdquo; She ducked back under and swam towards the Lab Cave.\n\u0026ldquo;Lab rats,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s all we are; just lab rats.\u0026rdquo;\nJanice smiled, remembering how Pat had explained to them after they arrived at the lagoon, the scientists wanted to compare some data that had cropped up in Kate and Ann\u0026rsquo;s dual transformation. The plan would be for Julie to go first, then Brian, each single transformation recorded and tracked. Then, Janice and Jaclyn would go together, like their children had before them, only this time with the full compliment of mers to speed their change. Pat had told them that she didn\u0026rsquo;t know what the anomaly in the data was, but she hoped the data from their change could help figure it out.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, Mom!\u0026rdquo; Rose said as she broke the surface of the water. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re waiting for you!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about me?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn asked, arching an eyebrow at her former son.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what I said,\u0026rdquo; Rose smiled. \u0026ldquo;Mom covers both of you now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s got a point,\u0026rdquo; Janice agreed, smiling at her beautiful sisterwife. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a mom now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, only technically,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s not really a mom until she gives birth to her first child.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hello! What\u0026rsquo;s the hold up?\u0026rdquo; Kate asked as she and Ann surfaced next to Rose. \u0026ldquo;You guys chickening out again?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Where are the guys?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said, looking around the cave with a leer.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha, ha. Not funny, MOM,\u0026rdquo; Rose said.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not chickening out,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;Pat asked us to wait a bit, something about a sensor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s always doing that,\u0026rdquo; Rose agreed. \u0026ldquo;So, Mom Two, are you excited?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that what I\u0026rsquo;m going to be called?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn groaned. \u0026ldquo;Part Two?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we could call you the new one,\u0026rdquo; Ann said.\n\u0026ldquo;Great,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;That makes me the old one. You\u0026rsquo;ll pay for that one, my dear.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I say one thing, and I\u0026rsquo;m the one in trouble!\u0026rdquo; Ann complained. \u0026ldquo;Why does that always happen to me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because you\u0026rsquo;re the middle child,\u0026rdquo; Kate said, giving her sister-wife a kiss. \u0026ldquo;But we love you anyways.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ready, all systems go,\u0026rdquo; Pat said breathlessly, popping up near the edge of the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go, my love. Let\u0026rsquo;s join our children,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, smiling at her daughters.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn agreed. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s.\u0026rdquo;\nAll the mers flipped back under the water, leaving the two of them standing alone at the edge of the pool. Behind them, Danni and Liga finished settling down all the baby mermaids. Janice and Jaclyn looked down at their legs a final time and then—still holding hands—stepped into the pool. The water closed over their heads, and they slowly sank together until reaching the depth at which everyone else waited. Both girls felt their gill fronds begin working but knew they couldn\u0026rsquo;t last long with out starting the change. Their gills were still underdeveloped. They turned and waved at their children, knowing they would not be feeding from any of them for this final feeding, they then gave each other\u0026rsquo;s hand a squeeze and separated to opposite sides of the pool.\nJaclyn looked into the rich green eyes of Petra, who along with Galina would soon no longer be the longest/tallest mermaids of the group. She kicked her legs moving closer to the beautiful mermaid, noting that her own, brand-new-breasts were nearly the equal of Petra\u0026rsquo;s and Galina\u0026rsquo;s generous mounds. Hers, Jaclyn knew, were smaller than Petra\u0026rsquo;s or Galina\u0026rsquo;s both in over all mass and in the size of their areolas and nipples, but her conical shape made hers stick out further away from her ribs, and she was proud of how symmetrical and beautiful they were. So little time as a woman, Jaclyn mused to herself, and she was already thinking like a jealous high school girl.\n\u0026ldquo;Petra, share with me your milk and give me my tail?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Drink from me, and become one of us,\u0026rdquo; Petra intoned, enjoying the ritual they had developed over time.\nJaclyn sensed that Janice was doing the same with Pat on the opposite side of the circle as she closed her lips over Petra\u0026rsquo;s enormous dark nipples. Petra\u0026rsquo;s milk came quickly, and soon Jaclyn was struggling to keep most of it going into her own body. She finished with Petra and moved on to Galina, feeling the strength and power of the siren cells begin to build within her.\n\u0026ldquo;Galina, share with me your milk and give me my tail?' she repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Drink from me, and become one of us,\u0026rdquo; Galina said with the same solemnity.\nJaclyn found Galina\u0026rsquo;s breasts less potent than Petra\u0026rsquo;s, but remembered that Petra was a mother, making it a big difference. When she finished with Galina\u0026rsquo;s however, she could tell that Brian was right; they were not going to need the contributions of everyone to make this transition. Pat had said to trust their own instincts, and Jaclyn found that her body was growing warm, and knew she should move to Julie. She turned her body and saw that Janice had come to the same conclusion. Together they swam towards their future pod-mates.\n\u0026ldquo;Julie, share with us your milk and give us our tails?\u0026rdquo; they said together.\n\u0026ldquo;Drink from me, and become one of us,\u0026rdquo; Julie said, pushing her now larger chest towards her sister and sister-wife.\nThe two girls went to one breast each and began to suck. The bonds they had already created among one another caused Julie to feel intense pleasure as she fed her future mates. Her eyes rolled back and her body quivered in an orgasm, her black and green tail and flukes shaking with passion. Janice and Jaclyn felt the full power of the siren cells build within them, and then turned to Brian, his cock already stiff in the water, pointing between them.\n\u0026ldquo;Brian, share with us your semen and give us our tails?\u0026rdquo; they asked together.\n\u0026ldquo;Drink from me, and become one of us,\u0026rdquo; he grunted, trying to hold back the imminent orgasm that threatened to go early.\nJanice closed her lips around his now enormous cock, and immediately Brian started ejaculating. One, then two enormous pulses shot into her mouth, and she fell back and felt Jaclyn take over. Three, four, and then a fifth pulse shot into Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s mouth, each one sending a jolt of energy through her body. Together, the two girls stopped moving, their legs growing stiff and straight, while their arms rose outstretched to each side. They hung there for a second before Julie and Brian gently positioned the now helpless girls in the center of the pool.\nFor a moment, everything was still, and then the two girls began slowly spinning in the center of the pool. The sound of mermaids singing rose in the water. Julie and Brian backed away from the two proto-mermaids, joining the others along the wall of the pool, watching as thousands of tiny bubbles began to form around the two slowly spinning bodies.\nJaclyn sensed Janice floating in front of her, and sensed Julie and Brian finding their way back to the wall. She also could feel the water become infused with energy as the microorganisms began coalescing around her body. She tried to focus on Janice, but she could not see her nor yet sense her through the growing veil of bubbles rising around her. She discovered her arms were now stiff and outstretched from her body. She didn\u0026rsquo;t recall ever moving them. Her legs, she felt, were trying to stretch themselves down towards the bottom of the pool. Everything in her body felt vaguely uncomfortable.\nGreat waves of energy crashed through her, and she felt a prick of pain as her leg bones were literally cut by the combined efforts of the siren cells and the microorganisms, new joints and bones being constructed even as her old ones were broken and reshaped. She could feel a sheath of skin form over her now fused legs, and her feet beginning to compress and squeeze out and away from her joined ankles. Like plastic pushed into a transparent mold, her new flukes fanned out below her, and felt the tickling of her new mer-senses come into focus as her fringes pushed out along the trailing edge of her flukes. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t move anything, though she desperately wanted to feel her tail move in the water. She became aware of two new sets of fins, one at her knees and one at her hips, and those too gained the fringes helping her mer-senses come further into focus.\nAnother great wave of pressure passed through her, feeling her womb lengthen and change, her vagina pressing down further along her tail, and new vent flaps forming around her labia. Her hips grew wider still, and her breasts grew a little heavier, falling just a tiny bit further down her chest, losing their almost unnatural conical shape. She felt fins press out from her elbows, the texture of her skin changing. She could feel her hair brushing along her newly formed dorsal ridge, hair and fringes caressing one another. Her whole body felt as if a low grade current was buzzing through her, racing from one end of her body to the other. Every once in a while a zap of energy would erupt from a fin, fluke, or breast. And when it did, a million tiny mouths seemed to nibble at her body.\nSuddenly, a great wave of pleasure gripped her entire body, and she arched backwards, her tail curling back over her head, its green scales and golden highlights shimmering above her face. Just like her daughter\u0026rsquo;s she thought, her tail was just like theirs and she hadn\u0026rsquo;t said anything about what colors she should be. Then, just as suddenly, the vice grip was released, and she relaxed in the water.\nThe bubbles slowly cleared, and she could see her new sister-wife floating next to her. Janice\u0026rsquo;s long red and black tail mirrored their other daughter\u0026rsquo;s coloring, Rose. Janice\u0026rsquo;s body had matured into the dramatically shaped form of all mermaids, slightly larger breasts, wider hips, and strong tails that were double the length of their human torsos.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god,\u0026rdquo; Janice said in her new, silvery voice. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re so beautiful.\u0026rdquo;\n[So are you,] Jaclyn said, testing out her new CHEW.\nThey both sensed Julie and Brian as they swam to the center of the pool to join them, and they were also aware of the splash of two mermaids entering the water from above, driven to join their pods by the miraculous power of these transformations. All around them, pods collapsed onto themselves, the flashing lights of the mers' bioluminescence competing with the still bright sunlight that dappled the water of the Moon Pool. The sounds of passion, communicated both orally and via their CHEW filled the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;We made it,\u0026rdquo; Julie said, drinking in the sight of her beautiful pod. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, smiling at her sister. \u0026ldquo;And now, we must bond.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Over and over,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said with a growl.\nJanice and Jaclyn both grabbed one of Julie\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fins and positioned her in front of Brian. Julie moaned in anticipation, watching with fascination as Brian opened his vent, his penis rising from within his long, powerful tail. Like a slowly telescoping arm, rather than a rising crane, Brian\u0026rsquo;s cock continued to grow and thicken as it reached out for Julie\u0026rsquo;s vent, which was also responding by swelling and opening, exposing the still human shaped labia within.\nJanice and Jaclyn pulled Julie\u0026rsquo;s fins until Brian\u0026rsquo;s cock probed her vent, and then waited for Julie\u0026rsquo;s tail to wrap around his. Once she entwined her tail around Brian\u0026rsquo;s, then both other girls wrapped their tails around the two of them. Jaclyn watched Janice\u0026rsquo;s eyes widen as they both found the right position that placed their vents at the ends of Brian\u0026rsquo;s pelvic fins, which were already vibrating.\nJaclyn watched as both Julie and Brian leveraged their tails to start stroking Brian\u0026rsquo;s cock in and out of her body. Her own body was flushed with desire, and she concentrated on the building tension in her body that signified her first mer-orgasm. She marveled at how the end of Brian\u0026rsquo;s fin stayed firmly lodged in her vent, pressed against her clit, no matter how far his hips moved back and forth. As the tension build within her body, Jaclyn felt her breasts grow heavy, and she realized that soon she would produce mermaid milk for the first time. She watched Janice\u0026rsquo;s eyes slowly close with passion as they both raced towards their first mer-orgasms. She grabbed Brian\u0026rsquo;s dorsal fin to pull herself more firmly onto his pelvic fin, forcing the tip of his vibrating appendage deeper into her body.\nHer efforts were immediately rewarded as her now heavy breasts began to leak milk into the water. She saw through lidded eyes, Julie\u0026rsquo;s breasts spraying milk, shaking with each powerful thrust of Brian\u0026rsquo;s hips. Jaclyn looked down at herself, her enormous new breasts, her flat, thin waist, her wide, generous hips with Brian\u0026rsquo;s fin pressed firmly into her vent, and she gave herself over to her orgasm. Without any conscious control of her own, her hips moved in the very same rocking, vibrating motion they had when she was still a human. She felt like a passenger in her own body as her orgasm took over, her body shaking with even greater pleasure than ever before, her new mer-womb filling her abdomen with powerful throbs of clenching, quivering pleasure. Jaclyn realized that she was screaming, then she realized she wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only one. A rich, milky cloud covered their pod as all four mers thrashed out their first mer-orgasms together.\nTo be continued?\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/changes-in-paradise14/","tags":["mermaids","transgender","transformation"],"title":"Changes in Paradise: Part 14 - Choosing Change"},{"categories":["Mermaids"],"contents":"The story picks up from where we last left off. Mac and Joy are unconscious, near death; the rescue team arrives in Davao searching for the Thompson\u0026rsquo;s mother; Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pod delivers the doomsday device and rescues some crash survivors; and another slice of paradise is revealed.\nJackson \u0026ldquo;Jack\u0026rdquo; Baker was an odd duck, and he knew it. One of the great perks of being rich was that it rarely mattered what anyone one else thought of you, so Jack indulged himself in all the characteristics that made him odd. He stretched his Ichabod-Crane-like-body upward, his long bony fingers reaching for the low, steel gray clouds that scurried across the winter sky. He admired, for a brief moment, the complex pattern the clouds formed as they jostled past one another above the dark waters of the Chesapeake Bay, but then lowered his eyes to the boat that was approaching from the north, bouncing across the choppy water. Sitting down on the pilings at the end of the long dock, he watched the small craft surging towards him.\nAnnette Dawson had called earlier that morning. Her husband Brent and two friends were going to arrive and it was a \u0026ldquo;company emergency,\u0026rdquo; which he understood to require absolute secrecy. Annette had been one of the few people in his life with whom he actually felt comfortable talking, despite her beauty. One other person was his boyhood friend, Kyle Johnson. Annette was much prettier. From their very first meeting in college, Annette had somehow put him at ease, and they had remained friends ever since. She was an incredibly bright undergraduate with sparkling green eyes, a thick head of blond hair, and a piercing intellect. He was a reclusive doctoral student in computer programming, but she had found him intriguing and became one of Jack\u0026rsquo;s few friends. They started working together professionally only six years ago, when she brought him in on a case as a consultant. Jack smiled as he remembered how impressed her superiors were with his speed and efficiency in programming the complex web-bots that identified, tracked, and logged terrorist cell phone calls.\nHe could see Annette\u0026rsquo;s blond hair whipping in the wind as the small boat approached. He frowned as he noticed that the boat was not The Slipper, which was Kyle Johnson\u0026rsquo;s deadrise work-boat that normally ferried passengers and supplies to his remote island. The Johnson\u0026rsquo;s had been friends with the Bakers for several generations, and Kyle was nearly the same age as Jack. Like Jack, Kyle was something of a loner, and the two men found an easy tolerance in the other, mostly born of their long association and partly because both men did not like talking. No, Annette and her crew were arriving in a speedboat, not Kyle\u0026rsquo;s sturdy working boat, but the speedboat looked as if it were equally as old as The Slipper, and a lot worse for the wear.\nJack thought back on his various associations with Annette. They had always enjoyed an easy friendship, no awkwardness after long absences, but Jack recognized that neither he nor Annette had ever sparked anything more than a friendship between them. There was no sexual tension. Nothing. Which was odd because Annette was beautiful. Jack knew that while he wasn\u0026rsquo;t, himself, repulsive, he was never going to be confused for a heartthrob. He hadn\u0026rsquo;t dated very may women in his relatively long life, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t know if he ever would. He didn\u0026rsquo;t want to die alone, but he had reconciled himself to the possibility. He watched as the boat drew nearer and shook his head to clear these old and well-worn issues from his mind. As the clouds of doubt finally cleared from his mind, the lurching boat drew up to the dock where he sat waiting.\nBrent Dawson eased the bobbing craft alongside the ramshackle dock while Annette threw the painter to Jack, who nimbly secured the line to one of the dock cleats at his feet.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you, Jack,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, as she reached up to his extended hand. \u0026ldquo;You have no idea how much this means to me.\u0026rdquo;\nJack nodded, his long face impassive.\n\u0026ldquo;We didn\u0026rsquo;t call Johnson\u0026rsquo;s Marine because we needed absolute secrecy,\u0026rdquo; she explained, sensing his question.\n\u0026ldquo;Kyle understands company business,\u0026rdquo; Jack said, as he caught the stern line and secured that to another cleat. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d trust him with my life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You may have to,\u0026rdquo; Annette said with a wan smile. \u0026ldquo;This isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly company business.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about it after we get these two inside,\u0026rdquo; Brent suggested impatiently, waving his hands over two figures covered in blankets. \u0026ldquo;Can you give me a hand?\u0026rdquo; he asked with a nod to Jack.\nJack nodded back and stepped down into the rocking boat, easily navigating the somewhat tamer gyrations of the boat as it lurched against the ropes holding it in place against the dark, winter waves. Brent stooped to pick up the larger of the two figures, and Jack again marveled at the retired Navy man\u0026rsquo;s strength and agility. Brent heaved what looked like a young man up from the fore section of the speedboat up onto the dock, where Annette steadied the shivering body. Jack was glad that he was still in decent shape himself as he reached down to pick up what looked like a young woman who was shivering, apparently delirious, wrapped in a wool blanket.\n\u0026ldquo;Right here,\u0026rdquo; Annette indicated a space next to the body Brent had deposited on cold, worn, wooden dock planks.\nAs Jack eased the shaking, female body onto the dock, Brent made his way aft and picked up several olive drab duffel bags. He gathered them up and joined Jack in the front of the boat. He handed the bags to Annette, who strung one over each shoulder and headed up the dock towards the house that brooded over the rocky island from its center.\n\u0026ldquo;You follow Annette up to the house with Joy,\u0026rdquo; Brent ordered, indicating the obviously female body Jack had just placed on the deck. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got something to do here, and then I\u0026rsquo;ll join you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Make sure it\u0026rsquo;s to the southwest,\u0026rdquo; Jack said as he picked up the still unconscious woman. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a deep spot in the channel about a mile out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You were always a smart one,\u0026rdquo; Brent said, with a stiff smile. \u0026ldquo;With this weather that\u0026rsquo;s about three minutes at 20 knots?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;bout that,\u0026rdquo; Jack agreed.\nHe watched Brent attach a small device to the bottom of the boat near the gas tank, and then lash the steering wheel and throttle to fixed positions. Brent released the bowline, pushing the boat into a southerly direction. He started the engine and hopped quickly up onto the deck, holding a second aft line in his hands. As the boat strained against the mooring lines, Brent tied both lines to a single cleat and then shortened one until he was satisfied, lining up the prow of the boat against the horizon. He checked his watch for a few seconds, and pulled a pocketknife from his pocket. He knelt down and watched the seconds go by, and then cleanly sliced through both lines, freeing the boat. He refolded the knife, gathered the severed ends of the rope still attached to the cleats, and turned to pick up the young man, still shivering on the deck.\n\u0026ldquo;They aren\u0026rsquo;t contagious, at least not in any conventional way,\u0026rdquo; Brent said.\n\u0026ldquo;It will make for a good story,\u0026rdquo; Jack said simply, turning with his burden and heading up the dock towards the house where Annette had already made her way inside.\n\u0026ldquo;You have no idea,\u0026rdquo; muttered Brent to himself lifting Mac into a firefighter\u0026rsquo;s carry and following the tall, thin man up the dock towards the ancient house looming over the grassy island. A few moments later, as they neared the house there was a short, loud thump that echoed sharply across the bay, followed by the soft, strangled sound of an outboard engine choking as it was overwhelmed by water.\n\u0026ldquo;I guess we\u0026rsquo;re staying for the night,\u0026rdquo; Brent joked.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yup,\u0026rdquo; Jackson observed, kicking the door open as he maneuvered Joy into the house.\n\u0026ldquo;Is all this really necessary?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn whined as she lay next to her new sister-wife, Janice, both of their bodies covered in a thicket of wires and sensors. \u0026ldquo;I feel like the frog in a high school biology class.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Almost done,\u0026rdquo; Pat assured the newly minted mermaid. \u0026ldquo;The data on your transition are the richest yet, and we need to try to figure out what factors affect our transformations. Your data might be able to help Mac and Joy or the rescue team up in Davao, so just relax, and it will all be over in a few minutes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The table is really uncomfortable,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn continued. \u0026ldquo;My dorsal fin itches.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Alexis reported from behind a cluster of computer screens, only her pink tail visible as it thumped impatiently on the polished floor of the cave. \u0026ldquo;Will someone please scratch her port side, about ten centimeters up from the base of her fin? My readings are getting corrupted by all that surface muscle twitching.\u0026rdquo;\nBrian left Julie\u0026rsquo;s side where he had been watching the mer scientists poke, prod, and measure two of his sister-wives and salamandered over to the table where the two beautiful, but very different mermaids lay next to one another. He carefully slid one hand under Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s shapely waist until he found her dorsal ridge, then approximating ten centimeters with his fingers; he gently scratched her soft fin where it bent against the table.\n\u0026ldquo;Aaaaaahhhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn sighed, her body relaxing as her mate\u0026rsquo;s fingers brought instant relief.\n\u0026ldquo;You always liked getting your back scratched more than anything else,\u0026rdquo; Janice teased. \u0026ldquo;Even a blowjob doesn\u0026rsquo;t compare.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I still do,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said with a wicked smile. \u0026ldquo;Now, however, I give blow jobs, not get them. Right Brian?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that a promise?\u0026rdquo; Brian joked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, trust me,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said, smiling, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t need to wait for another transition for an excuse to suck on your lovely cock.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How much longer on this testing?\u0026rdquo; Brian shot over to Pat, clearly agitated by Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s teasing.\n\u0026ldquo;Easy, Tiger,\u0026rdquo; Pat admonished. \u0026ldquo;You guys will get us all going again, and then we\u0026rsquo;ll have to start the data collection all over again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Brian, get back here,\u0026rdquo; Julie ordered. \u0026ldquo;I want all four of us back in the water, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to wait for Ms. Frankenstein to restart everything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s Dr. Ms. Frankenstein to you,\u0026rdquo; Pat joked.\nBrian returned to Julie\u0026rsquo;s side, letting his steel-gray and green flukes droop into the pool. Draping his arm around Julie\u0026rsquo;s waist, he watched as the mer scientists worked. Several moments of relative silence passed as Pat, Phoebe, Alexis, and Galina hunched over data screens and sensor arrays, while Jaclyn and Janice lay patiently on the table closest to the pool.\nBrian sensed a tingle running up his tail, and he recognized the stirring of his CHEW. His mer-senses were still new to him, and carefully he had to sort out John and Danni\u0026rsquo;s strong signals from their children\u0026rsquo;s signals. Closing his eyes to concentrate, he then identified Eric, Sally, Liga and little Mari\u0026rsquo;s signals. The tingling intensified as a new set of signals emerged from the long passageway connecting the Lab Pool to the Moon Pool. A few seconds later, he identified the signals of Gabriel, Petra, Xing, and Michelle as they swam towards him.\n\u0026ldquo;Your pod approaches, Galina,\u0026rdquo; he announced.\n\u0026ldquo;They can wait a few minutes,\u0026rdquo; she answered in her slight Russian accent. \u0026ldquo;We are almost done here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ten more minutes until we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to contact the rescue team,\u0026rdquo; Eric reported as he surfaced with the rest of his pod, searching for Alexis.\n\u0026ldquo;We know,\u0026rdquo; both Pat and Alexis answering in unison, neither lifting their heads from the screens flashing data in complex rows and columns.\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, knowing her pod mate knew the rest of the question.\n\u0026ldquo;Two minutes, nineteen seconds,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe reported from deep within the cave where she monitored the array of computers they had cobbled together into a mock supercomputer. \u0026ldquo;The data is clean, and all systems are green.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You should have seen what they did to me when they discovered I could see CHEW,\u0026rdquo; Eric said as he pushed himself out of the water and flopped next to Brian, Sally landing next to him a half second later. \u0026ldquo;The taste of that metallic paste stayed in my mouth for three days.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ugh,\u0026rdquo; protested Jaclyn. \u0026ldquo;Not what I was looking forward to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll get over it,\u0026rdquo; Eric joked. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not nearly as interesting as the anal probe.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you keep distracting us, you\u0026rsquo;ll get reacquainted intimately with that probe,\u0026rdquo; Galina said with a scowl.\n\u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t wait,\u0026rdquo; Eric said, thumping Brian on his shoulder.\n\u0026ldquo;No thank you,\u0026rdquo; Brian said with a grimace.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t knock it until you\u0026rsquo;ve tried it,\u0026rdquo; Janice said, winking at her mate.\n\u0026ldquo;Why do we still call it an anus even though it\u0026rsquo;s been moved over to the front?\u0026rdquo; asked Jaclyn.\n\u0026ldquo;Quiet,\u0026rdquo; hushed Galina, her scowl fighting for space on her face with a smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Good idea,\u0026rdquo; Eric advised in a whisper. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t piss off the Russian,\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Never a good idea,\u0026rdquo; Gabriel agreed in hushed tones.\n\u0026ldquo;But she\u0026rsquo;s worth it,\u0026rdquo; Petra said gently, her head bobbing above the water of the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;I said hush!\u0026rdquo; Galina repeated, but the smile won the battle as she lifted an eyebrow at her pod-mates.\nMalaki frowned at his computer screen, wondering\u0026ndash;again\u0026ndash;why two of his three sons had disappeared, along with a valuable (and beautiful) executive assistant, why one of his most reliable and ruthless operatives had disappeared along with his entire gang, and more importantly, why it felt like the edges of his carefully built empire were beginning to crumble.\nFor the last few months, many of his officers seemed to be acting with greater and greater independence. The disappearance of his sons, with little or no explanation from him, was probably the biggest reason why. Now he was getting reports that several of his most senior people were thinking of going independent. He had to act soon, and he needed to find his sons or produce their bodies as examples for what happens to even his own family members who are foolish enough to attempt an \u0026ldquo;independent\u0026rdquo; operation.\nOne of his Davao operators reported seeing Manalo and Abao together and suspected that they were plotting to overthrow their father. According to the reports, his sons had been dividing their time between Davao and several other remote islands, some of which were unknown to anyone. Malaki suspected that they spent most of their time at the old hide-away island that the equally absent Alberto had used occasionally. At first, the entire problem appeared to be Alberto going rogue, but now it seemed there was a deeper conspiracy within his organization, and that two of his own sons were leading it.\nAt first, Malaki refused to believe it. But he confirmed the rumors with his newest mole, Conjo. There was nothing like revenge to motivate a spy, Malaki thought. Conjo was not entirely trustworthy, and so Malaki decided that he would personally travel to Davao, find his sons, capture them, and then properly punish them for their disloyalty. He had hoped to hand off his business to his eldest son, but he was unwilling to let it be taken. The betrayal he felt gnawed at him, sending a tight knot of pain in his chest. He slumped before his computer, feeling the weight of his loss. Only his youngest, and least tested son, Torro, was left to him. Well, it was time to test his youngest son\u0026rsquo;s loyalty and leadership.\n\u0026ldquo;Sudhish,\u0026rdquo; he barked into the speakerphone on his desk as he straightened up.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir,\u0026rdquo; the voice crackled in return.\n\u0026ldquo;Make travel plans for Davao for the executive team, and get Torro in here immediately,\u0026rdquo; he ordered.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir,\u0026rdquo; the electronically transmitted voice replied again.\nMalaki frowned at the phone, considering what to do about his current executive assistant. His last one had disappeared with his eldest son, and while he hoped that they might be holding Shen against her will, he knew that the death of her sister had freed her to act independently. His sources had confirmed that the girl had been killed trying to escape, but those reports were deeply suspect.\nNo one had escaped from the Davao brothels in years, and he suspected that Manalo ordered the death of Shen\u0026rsquo;s sister, blamed it on his father, and then manipulated the girl in to serving him in revenge. That insult would add another day of pain for his son, provided he could put his hands on the bastard. Sudhish was modestly trust worthy as long as Malaki held his sisters in captivity. However, if his older sons were plotting to take over the operations at Davao, where he had recently transferred Sudhish\u0026rsquo;s sisters, then his hold over Sudhish was at risk.\n\u0026ldquo;Sudhish,\u0026rdquo; he said, as he punched the speakerphone button.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir?\u0026rdquo; his assistant answered from the other room.\n\u0026ldquo;Make plans to accompany the executive team to Davao,\u0026rdquo; he ordered.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir,\u0026rdquo; he replied.\nA visual reminder of the danger into which Malaki could put Sudhish\u0026rsquo;s family would be a useful reinforcement, Malaki decided. He could move the girls from the standard duties of prostitute to the more exotic duties of snuff film actress. Fear and revenge were useful tools, and Malaki had built an empire with those simple tools. It was time to return to basics, he concluded. Fear and revenge.\nThe six mermaid children swam in playful circles among and around the otherwise motionless twenty-four adult mers who had arranged themselves into their triangular formation for long-distance CHEW connections. Their playful squeals didn\u0026rsquo;t distract any of the adults, especially since toddler mermaids could not generate \u0026ldquo;directed\u0026rdquo; CHEW themselves. The sea was relatively still and calm off Mermaid Island, the bright sun glinting and sparkling off the gentle swells of the ocean. The tiny mermaids chased the flickering beams of light as they bounced around the otherwise still adult mers, being careful not to move too far away from their parents.\nJust beyond where the tiny mermaids frolicked, the sea floor fell away sharply a few meters in front of the lead mermaid, Pat. She floated at the front of the formation, concentrating on communicating with a mermaid thousands of kilometers distant. Her eyes were closed, and her long auburn hair floating around her pale, beautiful face like a fire-lace curtain that curling about her graceful neck, falling along her gently sloping shoulders, her lush breasts, and down past her slender waist. Her long, powerful tail, with its sparkling green scales that covered her wide hips, hung motionless beneath her, the pink fringes along her flukes and fins fluttering in the still water only when one of the children swirled past her. Her brow was furrowed in concentration as she communicated over a mind-boggling distance.\nShe was a vision of beauty, but no other mer was currently contemplating her beauty. Everyone was arranged behind her with their eyes closed too, all concentrating on their CHEW, helping to amplify Pat\u0026rsquo;s own signal. All the pods made for a colorful array that might have reminded a distant observer of a magnificent aquarium full of tropical fish floating over a sandy basin just beyond a dark coral reef, except they were in a perfect formation and otherwise unmoving. No normal fish behaved like that! Nor were the large fish and marine mammals of the ocean that colorful; not until recently, of course.\nUnknown to the beautifully, if unnaturally, arranged mermaids and mermen, a distant observer did pass overhead, so far overhead as to be invisible to the mers below, even if they had been looking upwards. Nevertheless, the silently orbiting satellite recorded yet another image of brightly colored aquatic animals arranged in a formation of inexplicable behavior in fish or sea mammals.\nThe surveillance system flagged and then shunted the picture into a Blackgate protocol folder, hiding it from nearly anyone who might casually stumble across it. That folder was growing slowly, and while the two creators of that folder were themselves now among those unbelievably colorful marine animals in that picture, the folder was nearing its maximum size before the protocol creating it needed reviewing and renewal. Someone, soon, was going to have to look at that folder.\nBoth Eric and Sally held their places within the formation near Liga and Alexis, all four of them ignoring the happy squealing of Mari, Liga\u0026rsquo;s child. Alexis still wasn\u0026rsquo;t showing, but she was pregnant with Agba\u0026rsquo;s child. As the former Russian scientist focused her efforts on boosting Pat\u0026rsquo;s CHEW, she could feel her womb throb as the mermaid within continued to develop, a faint glimmer of CHEW emanating from the fetus. Alexis refocused her attention from within to the conversation she was facilitating.\n[Yes,] Pat said, answering Trixi\u0026rsquo;s question. [We hope that Joy and Mac will make their transition safely. We have no way of reaching them now. Have you made contact yet with Michael Thompson?]\n[No,] answered Trixi. [We have made good use of the time, however, by performing a lot of reconnaissance. When did they say they would arrive?]\n[Two, perhaps three more days,] Pat answered. [Once you make your plans, please let us know what they will entail.]\n[Will do,] Trixi said. [Chat in 24 then?]\n[24.] Pat answered.\n[Rodger dodger, over and out.] Trixi said.\nThe formation of mers stayed still for a few beats more, and when Pat turned away from the west, everyone broke off into their individual pods to begin their day. James\u0026rsquo; pod, being some of the newest members of the mer family, could hardly contain their excitement as they raced each other from point to point. Pat rubbed her forehead lightly as she watched Bridget and Elise rocket towards the surface performing some aerial maneuver.\n[You O.K.?] Danni asked as she drew her long body next to her sisterwife' s.\n[Yea,] Pat answered. [This actually gets easier with practice. Is Phoebe supervising food for the brood?]\n[For a change,] Danni said as she wound her tail around Pat\u0026rsquo;s. [John\u0026rsquo;s helping.]\n[What\u0026rsquo;s gotten into you?] Pat asked as she felt Danni\u0026rsquo;s graceful fingers play along the edges of her gills, causing tremors to race along her body.\n[John\u0026rsquo;s orders, actually.] Danni said as she pulled Pat into an embrace, kissing her deeply.\n[What orders are those?] Pat asked, her chest rising and falling with increasing passion as her sister-wife expertly played her body like a musical instrument.\n[A little mermaid milk to rejuvenate the hard-working scientist, who stays up half the night crunching data and then does a little long distance CHEW in the morning,] Danni answered as she pushed Pat\u0026rsquo;s face towards her own breasts.\n[You guys are wonderful,] Pat said kissing the sides of Danni\u0026rsquo;s impressive breasts, working her way towards the long stiff nipple that now oozed milk into the water. [But this is just medicinal, right?] Pat teased as she lightly nipped Danni\u0026rsquo;s long nipple, causing the blond mermaid to twitch and moan in pleasure. A small squirt of mermaid milk shot into Pat\u0026rsquo;s mouth, the warm sweetness mixing with the cool saltiness of the ocean.\n[Uuuuuuh, yessssssss,] moaned Danni as she caressed Pat\u0026rsquo;s auburn hair to encourage her sister-wife to feed. [Nothing else, ooooh, at all. Just medicinal.]\n[Fine, then.] Pat said as she pulled Danni\u0026rsquo;s teat into her mouth and sucked hard. She felt Danni arch into the feeding, her body quivering with passion. Pat could feel her body responding quickly to the lifegiving, healing effects of the mermaid milk that was now gushing down her throat. She could also feel her flukes beginning to quiver as her own passion rose from within.\nAn hour later, Phoebe asked Danni to switch with her, and Pat happily embraced Phoebe as Danni swam back to John watching his three daughters continue to frolic unaffected by the shared passion of their mermaid mothers.\n\u0026ldquo;So, is some sort of parasite in these two that is changing them into mermaids?\u0026rdquo; Jack said, waving his hands towards the two swaddled figures still shivering on the floor of his family\u0026rsquo;s island home.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, only Joy will be a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Annette corrected. \u0026ldquo;Mac will be a merman, technically.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They call themselves mers,\u0026rdquo; added Brent.\n\u0026ldquo;Mers,\u0026rdquo; Jackson repeated, savoring the word. \u0026ldquo;And they need to be in sea water in order to complete their change.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We think so,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;Pat and the other mers are going to give me more a conclusive answer after the most recent batch of transformees had finished.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And that will be \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Jackson asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Soon?\u0026rdquo; Annette answered. \u0026ldquo;It may have already happened. The last few days have been pretty hectic with these two.\u0026rdquo; She waved her hand over the two unconscious people on the floor.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll try to raise the mermaids on the short wave early tomorrow morning, which should be their afternoon,\u0026rdquo; she explained.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, there\u0026rsquo;s no sense in waiting any longer, is there?\u0026rdquo; Jackson asked as he stood up. \u0026ldquo;Getting them into my primary tank won\u0026rsquo;t do them any harm, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Annette agreed. \u0026ldquo;As long as we keep their heads out of the water until we\u0026rsquo;re sure their gills are working.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Gills?\u0026rdquo; Jackson asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll see once we get them into the water,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered, nodding to her husband Brent, who rose to gather up the bundle cocooning Mac Bennett.\nJackson bent his long frame over the swaddled Joy Simpson and hoisted her into his arms. \u0026ldquo;Follow me,\u0026rdquo; he said as he headed for the basement stairwell.\nAnnette picked up one of the small, duffel bags and opened the door at Jackson\u0026rsquo;s invitation, watching the two men descend with their burdens. As she followed them down the stairs, she glanced around the otherwise unremarkable basement of an Eastern Shore island home. Jackson used Joy\u0026rsquo;s feet to move an otherwise normal looking pipe a few inches into the stone blocks of the foundation, and then stepped back as a section of the wall silently slid back to reveal another passageway angling down and away from the house.\n\u0026ldquo;When my father accidentally burnt down the chicken barn twenty years ago, I used that opportunity to build this facility,\u0026rdquo; Jackson explained. \u0026ldquo;The rebuilt chicken barn is a fake and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any working doors above ground, and the only access is through here.\u0026rdquo;\nThey made their way down the wide passageway until they emerged into a large underground room, having a thick, glass partition stretching across the room. The fake barn was visible above the three-meter high glass wall as it bisected the room. There was a winch with a chain at the apex of the rafters, and light filtered down through the seemingly transparent roof. The enormous aquarium stretched an additional five meters below the ground where they stood and at least ten meters back from the glass wall.\n\u0026ldquo;My god,\u0026rdquo; gasped Brent. \u0026ldquo;How big is this tank?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s nearly one million gallons,\u0026rdquo; Jackson reported. \u0026ldquo;And it is slightly more saline than the estuary water surrounding the island. There is direct outside access to the bay through a tunnel that connects to this tank, but you have to operate two different sets of locks and gates to swim through.\u0026rdquo; He gently laid Joy onto the floor.\n\u0026ldquo;We harvest energy from the tidal flows to power the systems keeping the water in the tank fresh, filtered, and aerated, but we have emergency pumps if something should happen with the passive system,\u0026rdquo; he explained.\n\u0026ldquo;So this tank could function in the absence of outside power?\u0026rdquo; Brent asked, impressed.\n\u0026ldquo;This tank DOES function in the absence of any outside power,\u0026rdquo; Jack said with pride. \u0026ldquo;The electrical pumps are backups in case we have to radically clean the tank, if an invasive species or algae bloom were to appear.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Jackson collects marine life as a life-long hobby and has a particular affinity for cuttle fish,\u0026rdquo; Annette added as she began to sort through the duffel bag. \u0026ldquo;You can see some of them over there,\u0026rdquo; she finished, pointing through the thicket of other fish swimming in slow lazy circles near the front of the tank. There, towards the back of the tank, Brent could barely make out a few cuttle fish darted among the rocks and reefs.\n\u0026ldquo;These two aren\u0026rsquo;t going to become an invasive species?\u0026rdquo; asked Jackson as he gently laid Joy onto the floor in front of the glass wall. \u0026ldquo;I mean the parasites that are in their bodies won\u0026rsquo;t harm my animals, will they?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The mers live in complete harmony with all kinds of marine life in their caves,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if cuttlefish share any of their spaces, but I know that fish who have been otherwise sick or injured have recovered after being exposed to the mers' unique parasites.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The same parasites in mers also healed fish species?\u0026rdquo; asked Jackson, stunned.\n\u0026ldquo;Apparently,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;Again, Joy told me as much, but I\u0026rsquo;ve only talked to rest of the mers twice over short wave, just before these two became delirious and then unconscious. Here, take one,\u0026rdquo; she added as she handed Jackson a small plastic bag.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s this?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a float that will keep their faces open to the air,\u0026rdquo; Annette explained, opening hers and unfolding the small plastic device.\n\u0026ldquo;If the parasites are beneficial, then why do these two look so sick?\u0026rdquo; Jackson asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The parasites live only part of their life cycle in mer bodies; they don\u0026rsquo;t live in them permanently,\u0026rdquo; Annette explained. \u0026ldquo;The microorganisms spend most of their life cycle outside a mer body, so that\u0026rsquo;s why they look sick. The mers identified over 50 different types of microorganisms all sharing a viral packet that carries inert Mer DNA. Inside a human body they become Siren Cells.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sirens of the Sea,\u0026rdquo; Jack said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;So, these two have been infected by a viral change agent. Aren\u0026rsquo;t you afraid of becoming infected?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I plan on becoming infected,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;However, according to my brief conversations with Pat, the mer scientists believe that the parasites are not topically viable, and that only immersion into an environment in which they live can actually allow the infection to occur. They can survive inside our bodies, particularly the GI tract, our reproductive fluids, and our lymph nodes, but not on our skin. They only appear on our skin for part of their life cycle. They cannot survive in air. We think these two were infected when they swam through the Moon Pool, which is the central chamber in the mer community.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Still doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain why these two look like they\u0026rsquo;re dying,\u0026rdquo; Jackson persisted.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m at the edge of my knowledge here,\u0026rdquo; Annette explained. \u0026ldquo;I think the parasites require the salts and minerals that are naturally dissolved in sea-water to function properly, and so they are harvesting those salts and minerals from within Joy and Mac\u0026rsquo;s bodies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why haven\u0026rsquo;t they changed,\u0026rdquo; Jack asked.\n\u0026ldquo;They have changed,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;Both of these two are, or were, our age.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They got younger?\u0026rdquo; Jack said, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, now they both look twenty-five,\u0026rdquo; said Annette.\n\u0026ldquo;A very pale, sunken, and sallow twenty-five,\u0026rdquo; offered Brent, unwrapping Mac from his woolen cocoon.\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;ve also started developing proto-mer features,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;Here, look at this,\u0026rdquo; she said as she unwrapped Joy a little bit, and pulled an arm free from the swaddling. Joy\u0026rsquo;s arm twitched every few seconds, sometimes from the wrist, sometimes from the elbow, sometimes just a few fingers. In fact her whole body was twitching and jerking about, just little twitches, but noticeable nevertheless. Jackson peered closely at Joy\u0026rsquo;s hand as Annette held it forward. There he could see webbing up to her first knuckle in between each finger.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; he breathed. \u0026ldquo;You weren\u0026rsquo;t kidding.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know how much they\u0026rsquo;ve changed internally either, but mers have several organs that humans don\u0026rsquo;t, and these new organs do everything from generating electricity, real electricity, to allowing them to see parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that we cannot,\u0026rdquo; Annette explained as she finished unwrapping Joy.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; Jack repeated. \u0026ldquo;Those parasites pack a wallop.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No kidding,\u0026rdquo; Brent said, surveying the two, twitching and shivering humans.\n\u0026ldquo;And you\u0026rsquo;re quite sure these parasites won\u0026rsquo;t hurt my animals?\u0026rdquo; asked Jackson.\n\u0026ldquo;Pretty sure. Most of these fish look very much like the ones we know live in in the same reefs and caves as the mers,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered, waving her hand towards the hundreds of fish swimming in the large tank.\n\u0026ldquo;But you weren\u0026rsquo;t sure about the cuttle fish?\u0026rdquo; Jackson persisted.\n\u0026ldquo;Even if they were in any danger, there\u0026rsquo;s only one or two in this tank,\u0026rdquo; Brent said.\n\u0026ldquo;How many?\u0026rdquo; Jackson asked, turning to Brent.\n\u0026ldquo;I can only see two, back there, see,\u0026rdquo; Brent answered, pointing to where he could see the medium sized creatures moving among rocks and sand.\n\u0026ldquo;There are seventeen cuttlefish in this tank,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said. \u0026ldquo;They can camouflage themselves like few other creatures on earth.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously?\u0026rdquo; Brent asked, searching the tank more carefully. \u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t they predators? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t most of these fish be dead?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; answered Jackson, warming to one of his favorite subjects. \u0026ldquo;But nearly all animal species in the ocean classify as predators, and yes, most of the fish you see here are supposed to be a dinner for the cuttlefish.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They won\u0026rsquo;t pose a danger to Joy and Mac, will they?\u0026rdquo; Brent asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Cuttlefish rarely attack anything bigger than themselves,\u0026rdquo; Jackson reassured. \u0026ldquo;They rely on stealth and surprise, not power or speed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do they have venom?\u0026rdquo; Brent asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said. \u0026ldquo;But they are more likely to use it on one another than on humans.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re the expert,\u0026rdquo; Brent said, eyeing the few cuttlefish he could actually see.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s one of only a few private citizens able to keep and cultivate cuttlefish in an aquarium,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;They are hard to keep and breed in captivity.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; Brent said, impressed.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a hobby,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said dismissively.\n\u0026ldquo;Jackson,\u0026rdquo; Annette began. She paused, and put a hand on his shoulder. \u0026ldquo;Jackson, both Brent and I plan to join them as mers. I can\u0026rsquo;t promise you that your pets will be unharmed, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to subject myself to this process as soon as I can. I promise you I will make whatever reparations you think necessary if something happens.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Would that include allowing me to join you as well?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha! I win five bucks,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, turning to her husband. Brent fished around in his pants for his wallet and gave her the money.\n\u0026ldquo;What did you bet?\u0026rdquo; Jackson asked, smiling at his old friend.\n\u0026ldquo;Brent still has some difficulties with the whole becoming-anotherspecies -thing,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;He didn\u0026rsquo;t think you\u0026rsquo;d want to become a mer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He doesn\u0026rsquo;t know me as well as you do,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;But we have lots to talk about what \u0026lsquo;joining\u0026rsquo; the mers actually means before I\u0026rsquo;ll let you make that decision. Just to start things off, the mers are organized in pods of three mermaids to one merman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But that would mean that \u0026hellip; that \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Jackson said, glancing at Brent and back to the body at his feet.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to become the third mermaid. It\u0026rsquo;s a long story.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to hear it,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said with a nod. \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t we get these two in the water before the parasites and siren cells kill them before they get the chance to change them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get them both undressed and set the floats,\u0026rdquo; Annette said as she moved over to Joy\u0026rsquo;s still twitching form. \u0026ldquo;Then we can winch them into the tank,\u0026rdquo; she finished, looking at the sling hanging on the far wall.\nA diamond shaped formation of four mers swam in unison about five meters below the ocean surface. The undulations of their bodies were not as graceful or fluid as mers were normally, but then again, mers did not usually swim while harnessed to an ungainly looking contraption that might end all life on the planet. The relatively large, cage-like device, which they decided to call The Device, lay suspended beneath them as they swam slowly but steadily. Each mer, three mermaids and one merman, wore a utility belt that fitted snugly around the mers' hips, just above their pelvic fins.\nAttached to each utility belt was a nylon rope, and all four ropes connected to a steel ring anchored in the center. From these four ropes The Device hung suspended in the middle of the mers about two meters below them. Anchored within the steel structural cage were several air bladders, almost giving The Device neutral buoyancy, thus towing the contraption wasn\u0026rsquo;t as impossible as it might otherwise have been.\n[How much further?] Ann asked from her starboard position in the formation.\n[Nearly there,] Trevor answered from his lead position in front.\n[Thank goodness,] Kate sighed. [You doing o.k. back there?]\n[I\u0026rsquo;m good,] Rose answered, bringing up the rear of the formation.\nThe mers swam for another hour before Trevor pulled them up and stopped. They each oriented vertically, keeping their flukes and fins moving to maintain their current depth. Trevor reached into a pocket along the side of his utility belt and removed a small device, oriented the device along cardinal points and pushed a button on its side. One of the four, intercardinal red LEDs blinked twice, then the center, green LED blinked once.\n[Only another 1000 meters to the northeast,] Trevor said, returning the digital GPS to his utility belt.\n[Wow, that was pretty good dead reckoning,] Rose said. [I don\u0026rsquo;t think that even Emma could get that close without help.]\n[Lucky,] Trevor said simply. [Even a blind squirrel gets a nut every once in a while.]\n[We\u0026rsquo;re going to have to come up with mer-versions of those sorts of sayings,] Ann said. [There are no sea squirrels.]\n[Crabs sort of act like squirrels, always scampering about, taking stuff back into their nest,] Kate said.\n[Can we return to our task?] Rose said. [I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to be yoked to this damn thing longer than I have to be.]\n[Sorry,] Kate said. [We\u0026rsquo;ll swim.]\n[It\u0026rsquo;s fine, my love,] Rose said back. [This is just a big responsibility.]\nThe mers turned together, reoriented horizontally, and continued to swim in perfect unison for another 1000 meters. Trevor stopped them and checked his GPS device again. This time the green LED blinked once.\n[Everyone ready for the descent?] he asked. Everyone responded affirmatively.\nTrevor released the air from two of the air bladders, and the pod angled toward the bottom of the ocean, swimming slowly into the darkness. They headed for the middle of a large abyssal plain in which an extinct volcano reached up from a depth of 5000 meters to a peak of only 500 meters below sea level. As they descended into the inky blackness, their mer senses took over. They began \u0026ldquo;seeing\u0026rdquo; millions of tiny life forms as well as thousands of fish and other sea creatures occupying the depths. Some of these creatures even generated their own bioluminescence, making the darkness seem less oppressive.\nEach of the mers could feel their bodies respond to the increase in pressure as their mer-organs kicked into overdrive, shielding them from the otherwise deadly pressure.\n[It\u0026rsquo;s so quiet down here,] Kate said with reverence.\n[I can\u0026rsquo;t believe our bodies can withstand this pressure,] Ann said. [I mean, I can feel it, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t hurting me.]\n[This isn\u0026rsquo;t very deep, as far as the ocean goes,] Rose reminded them. [And we can go much deeper if we have to. Just keep it slow and steady, and we\u0026rsquo;ll be fine.]\n[Let\u0026rsquo;s conserve our energies, shall we?] Trevor said. [We have a lot to do once we get there.]\nHe received non-verbal assent from each of his pod-mates and they continued downward in silence. After another ten minutes of swimming, they reached the top of the extinct volcano. It had the classic cone shaped top with a small crater-shaped bowl. Then they descended into its center.\n[It\u0026rsquo;s so empty,] Rose remarked, looking around.\n[It won\u0026rsquo;t be empty for long,] Trevor said.\nThey let The Device settle onto the sea floor and unhooked themselves from it. They coiled the ropes along cleats built into the frame of The Device, and then Trevor pulled the GPS device out and checked their location again. A single green LED blinked. He then carefully reached into the center of the contraption and grasped a lever near its center. He worked the ratchet back and forth for several minutes, winding a steel spring hidden within a waterproof cylinder tighter and tighter.\nWhen it finally \u0026ldquo;clicked\u0026rdquo; tight, he stopped. He pulled back from the frame and reached into his utility belt again and brought out a small, flat, device looking like a car remote. He pushed a hidden button and a beam of pale, blue light pierced the darkness. He pointed it towards the surface and watched the microorganisms and other small creatures pass through the beam. When he was satisfied that he could see the direction of the barely perceptible current, he shut off the light. Everyone took a moment to re-adjust to relying on their mer-senses, then he signaled his girls to swim with him to the far side of The Device, and there he brought them all into a group hug.\n[We have to secure the Dead Man\u0026rsquo;s Trigger,] he said. [Who wants to go first?]\nThe three mermaids all looked at one another. They all remembered Pat\u0026rsquo;s admonitions about the responsibility given them: the future of all mers and the future of the entire planet. Each felt the weight of those words weighing heavily upon their hearts, their chests tightening with emotion.\n[God, I can\u0026rsquo;t believe we\u0026rsquo;re going to do this,] Kate said.\n[I can\u0026rsquo;t believe we HAVE to do this,] Ann said, putting her head against Trevor\u0026rsquo;s shoulder.\nNone of them wanted to admit it, but it was difficult for them to be in the mood, so to speak. After towing their burden for nearly two days, and arriving at this great a depth, and knowing that the hulking steel framed device next to them could wipe out all life on the planet, all combined to put a damper on even a mermaid\u0026rsquo;s libido. A few moments passed, the four of them floating silently in the darkness.\n[We can\u0026rsquo;t not set it,] Trevor said. [I\u0026rsquo;ve already tightened the spring. We have to do this.]\n[I\u0026rsquo;ll go first!] Rose said with sudden force, twisting her body to be in front of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s, forcing Kate to move to one side. [We\u0026rsquo;re going to make so much love right here that this thing won\u0026rsquo;t be able to go off for at least two years!]\nShe grabbed Trevor\u0026rsquo;s face, which she could sense more than she could see, and kissed him fiercely. As soon as she did, her tail began flickering softly in the darkness. Soon Trevor\u0026rsquo;s tail was also flickering as she built up their passion slowly and deliberately. Rose broke away from the kiss and floated down Trevor\u0026rsquo;s torso, kissing and stroking his body as she descended.\nWhen she got to his vent, she began teasing him until he pulled at his vent muscle, releasing his now expanding cock into the cold, dark sea. She took him into her mouth, giving it a few quick strokes, making sure her lover and mate was ready, and then she flicked her tail and rose quickly back up to his face. She kissed him again.\n[It\u0026rsquo;s ironic, you know,] Trevor said.\n[What\u0026rsquo;s ironic?] Asked Ann as she drew near, trying to add her own energy to Rose and Trevor\u0026rsquo;s slowly growing passion.\n[Love is what will keep the world safe,] Trevor said, giving Ann a quick kiss.\n[Love is the only thing that can keep the world safe,] Ann said.\n[Well then, let\u0026rsquo;s set this trigger so that it can never go off,] Rose said huskily, her body flush with passion, her tail now flickering madly with bioluminescence.\n[Yes, let\u0026rsquo;s get this love-fire going,] Kate said as she floated next to Trevor opposite Ann.\nRose put her arms around Trevor\u0026rsquo;s neck, and kissed him again, grinding her pelvis against his, trapping his cock between them. She turned her head, inviting Ann in for a kiss. Her sister-wife gave her a fierce kiss, massaging Rose\u0026rsquo;s full breasts as she did. Kate pulled Trevor into a kiss from the other side. Rose continued to grind her hips into Trevor, while Ann stroked and pulled on her breasts and nipples. She felt her breasts grow heavy with milk, and she moaned into Ann\u0026rsquo;s kiss. Rose felt Kate reach down and grasp Trevor\u0026rsquo;s cock. She moved her hips back, and let Kate position Trevor\u0026rsquo;s cock between her now engorged vent.\n[I love you,] she said, looking at each of her mates in turn. She then locked eyes with Trevor as all three together pushed his cock inside her. Rose luxuriated in the feeling of fullness that his mighty penis created inside her. She held his gaze as he buried himself to the hilt, her warm depths burning like a furnace compared to the frigid water around them.\nThe lights emanating from Trevor and Rose dazzled both Kate and Ann, and they re-positioned themselves along Trevor\u0026rsquo;s sides, where his pelvic fins were alive with light and motion. They each nestled their own vents along the ends of his fins and locked their hands behind both Rose and Trevor creating a group hug.\n[God, this is so amazing,] Kate said.\n[Yea,] Ann agreed, feeling her breasts swell with passion.\n[The future of the world,] Rose said, her body tense with passion. [We have to protect the future of the world.]\n[You guys are the future of the world,] Trevor said, wrapping his tail around Rose\u0026rsquo;s, feeling both Ann and Kate press into him on each side, the tips of both his pelvic fins vibrating inside a fiery mermaid\u0026rsquo;s vent.\nRose rolled her hips into Trevor\u0026rsquo;s slow stroking, her vent rippling against his cock as it slowly sank into her and gripping it as he slowly withdrew. Her breasts reached their fullest as her passion rose, and she could feel the warmth of her own milk beginning to leak from her nipples.\nTrevor\u0026rsquo;s rhythm increased steadily, and she gave herself over to the rising power of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s stroking, feeling her body jerk each time he slapped into her hips, the pleasure rippling outward from that point, roiling through her stomach, shaking her heavy breasts now beginning to spray milk into the murky water. Flashes of her days as Robbie appeared in the dark water around them like misty images that only sweetened the embrace they shared.\nAs her body embraced the welcome assault of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s affections, Rose remembered her transformation in his arms and the adventures they had already shared. She remembered her parents and the long talks she had with her father before he became Jaclyn, and she wondered if her father felt the way she did when Brian made love to him/her. Trevor\u0026rsquo;s eyes seemed to bore into hers, and in those eyes, she saw herself nearly overwhelmed with passion. She wondered if Jaclyn remembered being Hank when Brian pounded into her. Soon Trevor\u0026rsquo;s hips were mighty pistons, and she couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but vocalize each time he bottomed out in her womb. The dark depths kept her shrieks small and quiet, but her passion overcame the murky, oppressive depths. In the midst of her passion, Rose wondered what a child of her own might be like, and suddenly a spark of passion overtook her and gripped her body.\n\u0026ldquo;Treeeeevvvvoooooooooorrrrrrr,\u0026rdquo; she screamed into the silent depths as her body began convulsing. She tried to focus on Trevor\u0026rsquo;s eyes, his beautiful blue eyes, but all she could see were a sparkling pair of violet eyes that she had never yet seen. She suddenly realized what she was doing, but it was too late to stop visualizing her daughter\u0026rsquo;s eyes. Her vagina suddenly clamped down on Trevor\u0026rsquo;s cock, stopping him just as he started an outward stroke, trapping him within her fiery depths. Rose\u0026rsquo;s own orgasm forced her eyes to roll back in her head and her entire body convulsed around Trevor\u0026rsquo;s now stationary cock, her breasts gushing milk into the sea.\n\u0026ldquo;Roooooseeeeeee,\u0026rdquo; Trevor heaved as his cock was being magnificently massaged by muscles in Rose\u0026rsquo;s birth canal that sought one thing; his seed. He was barely aware of Ann and Kate both starting into their own intense orgasms, thickening the water with mermaid milk, much of it drifting over and around The Device. He felt a powerful, unstoppable orgasm rise up from deep within his tail, shoot through his trapped cock, and pulse into the quivering and jerking body of Rose. After the fifth pulse, his own eyes rolled back in his head, and he joined his beloved pod-mate in blissful unconsciousness.\nSudhish closed his eyes as the small jet bounced in the turbulence, trying to will his stomach into submission. He tasted his own bile, but he swallowed and refocused his efforts. After a few moments he felt his stomach settle, and he opened his eyes.\nThere were eight people on the sleek, small Leer jet, and Sudhish could see that the beefy bodyguards that Malaki always had near him were laughing at his airsickness. He closed his eyes again, shutting out the brutes making up most of the passengers on the jet, focusing on memorizing the instructions he had received from Conjo. He went over them again and again, while he fingered the ring on his right hand. How Conjo had made a copy of this old ring, Sudhish didn\u0026rsquo;t really know. But the new ring, with its hidden transmitter, looked exactly like his old, Oxford school ring.\nSudhish hoped that Conjo would be able to pull off this surprise attack. The five bodyguards that Malaki had brought with him were experienced, hardened, and capable men, and Sudhish knew each of them was incredibly well-armed. Malaki\u0026rsquo;s son, Torro was also present, but he was the same size as his father. Sudhish surmised that he was along for the ride because Malaki hoped to teach him a lesson, one that probably involved his sisters. He twisted the ring with nervous anticipation. Why did all this have to happen, he thought somewhat uselessly to himself. His three beautiful sisters were now sex slaves in some wretched corner of the Philippines, and unless he could free them, they would all eventually die.\nHe screwed his eyes tightly shut as the jet dipped and bucked in the air. In the swirling colors behind his tightly clenched eyelids, he could not make the vision of Geeta, his older sister, being beaten and raped leave his mind. She was closest to him in age, and she was one of the most beautiful women he knew, even if she was his own sister. Up until two weeks ago, he lay trapped in a situation from which he did not know how to escape. Now, he had hope, not much, but it was something. He shook his head, breathing deeply, both to control his nausea and to steel his nerves for what was to come in Davao. He needed to be able to think, to act when the time came. He had no idea what Conjo\u0026rsquo;s instructions might mean, but he was determined to follow them to the letter.\nOnce in the brothel, turn the stone in the ring one-quarter turn. Find the window or door closest to the sea. Open it, if possible. Ignore Conjo if you see him. If a little whale slapped her tail on the water, jump into the belly of the whale to be safe.  He had no idea what that last one meant, and he worried that none of the instructions seemed to include his sisters. According to Conjo, Malaki had captured and enslaved all three of his sisters. His parents were devastated, he knew. Somehow, he would make everything right. Somehow.\nFirst, he just had to survive the flight, he thought as the plane lurched again.\nAbout an hour after Jackson had released Joy and Mac from the sling, allowing them to float freely in the tank. Both stopped the involuntary twitching that had plagued them for days. The three of them watched for the rest of that afternoon, but there were no other changes. They noted with relief that the other animals in the tank were completely uninterested in the two humans drifting among them. Despite a long afternoon of watching, neither Joy nor Mac showed any signs of regaining consciousness.\nAfter a brief dinner break, Jackson, Annette, and Brent divided themselves into shifts to watch over the two changelings, in case they did regain consciousness. Jackson pulled a cot from a storage closet and settled down for the first shift that evening. He attached a movement alarm to the corner of each of the floats that supported the proto-mer\u0026rsquo;s heads above the surface of the water, and then he settled into his cot. He was asleep within the hour.\nWhen Annette relieved Jackson in the morning, carrying two warm mugs of coffee, she found him still asleep. After nudging him awake, they sat together for nearly an hour simply watching the tank and sipping their coffee. It was beautiful and calming. Both Joy and Mac were naked, suspended in the water by the floats around their necks, their now youthful and graceful bodies were completely still, no movement whatsoever except for the barely perceptible movement of their chests.\nTheir statuesque stillness contrasted dramatically with the constant movement of most of the other animals in the tank. The Tangs and Puffers mixed among the Parrotfish and Damsels, a few large Groupers moved lazily along, and the cuttlefish scuttled occasionally among them, the other fish avoiding them as much as possible. It was mesmerizing.\nAfter Brent had spent most of the afternoon watching the tank impassively, he noticed a small change in the two humans. Tiny air bubbles covered them, sticking to their skin in odd patterns. The most densely blanketed area was over their new gills, red patches of skin that had lengthened and darkened overnight. When he called the others in for confirmation, they all noticed that nearly all of Mac\u0026rsquo;s body hair had disappeared, and that both of them appeared to have longer hair. Still, however, there appeared to be no signs of their awakening.\nOn the second day, Jackson discovered that the tank\u0026rsquo;s salinity had changed dramatically. He started cycling more water from the bay into the tank. They were finally able to raise Pat and the other mers on the short wave radio, and together they decided to add more salt and some key minerals to the water that the mers had discovered to be major factors in their transformations. Jackson made a quick call to Kyle Johnson, and two hours later his old friend showed up with the necessary supplies.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure about this?\u0026rdquo; asked Annette as she watched the Slipper approach from the northeast.\n\u0026ldquo;I trust him with my life,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said, watching his boyhood friend expertly maneuver the shabby looking craft up to the dock.\n\u0026ldquo;Jackson,\u0026rdquo; Kyle greeted his old friend with a nod. \u0026ldquo;Hello,\u0026rdquo; he smiled at Annette.\n\u0026ldquo;An old friend, Kyle,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said without inflection. \u0026ldquo;Her name\u0026rsquo;s Annette.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Annette,\u0026rdquo; Kyle repeated, brushing his unkempt, graying hair away from his ruddy face.\n\u0026ldquo;Pleased to meet you,\u0026rdquo; Annette said with a nod of her own.\n\u0026ldquo;I got your supplies,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said as Jackson secured the lines to the dock cleats. \u0026ldquo;It sure is a small package for being so expensive.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll pay you \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Jackson began.\n\u0026ldquo;I know you will,\u0026rdquo; Kyle interrupted. \u0026ldquo;You said there was something special. The Company?\u0026rdquo;\nAnnette stiffened at the now all too common nickname for her previous employer.\n\u0026ldquo;Not really,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said. \u0026ldquo;But the same rules apply.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yup,\u0026rdquo; Kyle returned as he bent to pick up a small, canvas sack from near his feet. \u0026ldquo;Do you want it now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said. \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you bring it on up to the house? It\u0026rsquo;s for the Chicken Shed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yup,\u0026rdquo; Kyle nodded, stepping up onto the dock. Kyle looked casually from Jackson to Annette as the former turned to head up to the house. \u0026ldquo;How long have you been retired from The Company, Annette?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\nAnnette shot Jackson a stern glance, but he already had his back to her, heading back towards the house.\n\u0026ldquo;I never said a word,\u0026rdquo; Jackson answered without turning around. \u0026ldquo;Scout\u0026rsquo;s honor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t like it when I said it the first time,\u0026rdquo; Kyle explained as he offered to allow Annette to go up the path first. \u0026ldquo;It weren\u0026rsquo;t too difficult to figure out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I must be off my game,\u0026rdquo; Annette said ruefully. \u0026ldquo;Getting old,\u0026rdquo; she grumbled, turning to follow Jackson back up to the house.\n\u0026ldquo;Not from where I stand,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said with only the slightest touch of lechery.\n\u0026ldquo;Men!\u0026rdquo; Annette groused, hiding her smile from both of them.\nLeonard Simon\u0026rsquo;s knuckles were white as he gripped the railing of the Johanna. He had been standing along the edge of the boat, unmoving and in a near state of shock for over fifteen minutes. No one else noticed, at first, because all four were all equally shocked. Peter LaMond eventually noticed that his boat-mate didn\u0026rsquo;t appear to be breathing.\n\u0026ldquo;Len?\u0026rdquo; Peter whispered. \u0026ldquo;Len! Breathe! And stop staring!\u0026rdquo;\nPeter chuckled at Len\u0026rsquo;s startled reaction and sheepish grin, but he also blushed at his own realization that he had been gaping at the exotic and unbelievable creatures too. In his seventy-two years of life, Peter LaMond, retired chemist, had never expected to see a mermaid, not a girl in a specially made costume so she looked like a mermaid, but an actual one. The previous day, Michael Thompson, skipper of The Johanna, had anchored along the unpopulated south eastern shore of Davao Gulf in preparation for today\u0026rsquo;s meeting. Despite knowing that they were meeting the mers, nothing prepared them for actually seeing them for the first time.\nMichael had positioned the boat so that the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary rose dramatically off their starboard bow, while the large and mostly placid Davao Gulf extended off their port side to the west. The provincial capital in Davao City was to the north, which allowed the recently arrived mermaids and mermen to hide in the lee of The Johanna, protected from the line of sight of passing freighters headed towards the deep-water docks reaching out into the bright, blue water along the North West fringe of the gulf.\nThe twelve mers that bobbing in the water next to the boat shared what information they had been able to glean from their several nights of reconnoitering. Peter, Len, and Liz had watched with growing amazement as each pod, or family group, shared their bits of information. The most animated were Mu Su and his three girls. The triplets were identical mermaids, each with beautiful blue and white mottled tails sparkling with flashes of yellow, their tails gently swaying beneath them. It was impossible for Peter to tell them apart, but he could see that one was shyer than the other two, while Mu Su simply seemed to radiate quiet strength.\nThe obvious leader of the three pods was the merman with the long, black and purple tail, Mark who had an astoundingly diverse pod. Mark had the steely-eyed look of command, and both Mu Su and Wong, the other merman, deferred to him at every important juncture of their reports.\nHowever, Peter noticed with some surprise, that all three of the mermen deferred to their mermaids as a rule. That fact made the beautiful Trixi, a blond mermaid with a striped blue and yellow tail, the true leader of the group. She also seemed to mother all of them, especially Mu Su and his girls.\nDespite his air of command, Mark often turned to her so she could summarize and translate some of the more excitable reports from the other mermaids. Never far from Trixi\u0026rsquo;s side was Homa, a dramatically beautiful Persian mermaid with a dark red and orange tail, luxuriously curly hair, and eyes that seemed ready to cut steel with the slightest glance. Homa was certainly one mermaid Peter made note never to cross. The final mermaid in Mark\u0026rsquo;s pod was Binah, an equally dark and beautiful mermaid, sharing the same dramatic coloring as Homa, but her intensely curly hair and ebony human half marked her African origins.\nThe last pod was lead by Wong and his equally exotic mermaids. Two of his mermaids were of Asian descent, like MuSu and Wong, and the girls had dragon red tails marked by gold and silver highlights. Shen and Lin shared nearly identical faces, long, straight, black hair that cascaded over their slender, dramatically more delicate figures, especially when compared to the other mermaids, but both sisters also shared that sinewy strength visible in the more generously proportioned mermaids in the other pods. Their third sister-wife, as Peter had learned they called one-another, was a classic French beauty, Esmée, whose tail coloring gave testament to her French ancestry and patriotism.\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously,\u0026rdquo; Peter admonished as he gently lifted Len\u0026rsquo;s chin up from his chest, causing his crewmate to stir in reaction.\n\u0026ldquo;Mermaids!\u0026rdquo; Len exclaimed, interrupting the report Emma was giving on their discovery of a duplicate of the Little Mermaid statue in Denmark on the other side of the peninsula. The mers all turned to look at Len, who was gripping the boat\u0026rsquo;s railing with white-knuckled amazement.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; he stuttered. \u0026ldquo;Please continue.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Anyway,\u0026rdquo; Emma continued with a smile for the still-stunned Len. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s perched on a few rocks along a really depressing seaside park in Manti City they call the Davao Baywalk. It\u0026rsquo;s really pathetic, though. Sort of like they got started with something and then ran out of money.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Rikki chimed in. \u0026ldquo;It looks just like the one in Copenhagen, but she\u0026rsquo;s plastic, I think. You can see where they painted her to look bronze, and the paint\u0026rsquo;s, like, chipping.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Totally,\u0026rdquo; Cleo agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Now that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen that statue in person, even if it is the fake one, I have to say, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t look anything like us,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;I think we turned out much prettier.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps we should return to the subject of rescuing your mother?\u0026rdquo; MuSu suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;Right!\u0026rdquo; exclaimed Cleo. \u0026ldquo;What have you been able to find out?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we can\u0026rsquo;t be sure of anything,\u0026rdquo; Michael Thompson began.\n\u0026ldquo;She is alive!\u0026rdquo; Rikki protested, as Emma and Cleo nodded vigorously.\n\u0026ldquo;However,\u0026rdquo; Michael said carefully. \u0026ldquo;We have made contact with Joy\u0026rsquo;s exCIA mole, Conjo, and he reports that an elderly Australian woman is functioning as the cleaning woman and maid for the girls at the brothel. She could very well be your mother, but \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;But what?\u0026rdquo; asked Rikki worriedly.\n\u0026ldquo;Conjo reports that this woman has been severely disfigured,\u0026rdquo; Michael continued as the triplets gasped, while their pod-mate\u0026rsquo;s eyes flinched into a squint of pure malice. \u0026ldquo;She seems to have suffered both physical mutilation and facial disfigurement. It was impossible to match her to your description.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter,\u0026rdquo; said Mark evenly, his commander voice rising above the now sobbing girls. \u0026ldquo;The women in that brothel deserve to be rescued, and some men and women deserve to be killed. We have a plan, and I think it can be successful. I would suggest that we not waste one more minute. If the woman is their mother, we won\u0026rsquo;t help her much by waiting. If she is not, we can rescue as many as possible, and then search in other locations.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mark is right,\u0026rdquo; MuSu said gently. \u0026ldquo;We should move quickly to rescue these women, and hope for the best. On the other hand, do we really want to wait until Malaki and his bodyguards arrive?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s too big a prize to ignore,\u0026rdquo; Mark answered. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;ll be far away from his home base, and we are unlikely to have such an opportunity in the future.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I suppose you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; MuSu agreed. \u0026ldquo;Waiting is \u0026hellip; difficult.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We gain more by waiting,\u0026rdquo; Mark reassured him.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure that you will be able to handle Malaki and his thugs?\u0026rdquo; asked Michael. \u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t it make more sense to do a surprise rescue, and then lure Malaki to our home base?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think you\u0026rsquo;ll be surprised at what a mer can do, both in and out of the water,\u0026rdquo; answered Mark. \u0026ldquo;He will be traveling light and fast, rather than slow and powerful. He is here, he thinks, to punish an errant son, and not contend with an ambush by sea creatures no one actually believes in.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it will be hard to keep things under wraps after this rescue mission,\u0026rdquo; Michael surmised. \u0026ldquo;All the other mers are ready for this kind of exposure?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actual mermaids rescuing sex-trafficked human women,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;It will shake up the world, but in a good way, I think.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see how my country reacts to powerful, naked women attacking the power of men,\u0026rdquo; Homa said with a fierce smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Mine too,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, smiling down at the mers she now hoped to join.\n\u0026ldquo;We move forward with our plans, then,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;Do you have the supplies we\u0026rsquo;ve given you stored safely?\u0026rdquo; he asked with a nod towards Peter.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got the containers,\u0026rdquo; Peter answered, tapping a satchel he had slung over one shoulder. \u0026ldquo;I have your instructions.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good.\u0026rdquo; Mark approved. \u0026ldquo;We should get moving. It will take you the rest of the day to get The Johanna into position. I suggest you weigh anchor now. We will rendezvous with you at midnight after you do your show.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will play the parts of rich perverts and find out as much as possible,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, turning quickly to move to the captain\u0026rsquo;s wheel. \u0026ldquo;Len?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;On it,\u0026rdquo; Len answered, tearing himself from looking at the most amazing creatures he had ever seen.\nJoy Simpson felt as if she was stuck in a spider\u0026rsquo;s web, her body suspended and trapped by millions of tiny strands, her limbs twitching against her restraints. She tried to shake her head and open her eyes. A shrill tone sounded in her left ear, repeatedly. She felt the web stir; the spider was coming for her. She struggled to move, but her body felt as if it was buried beneath a sea of cotton, a thick mush from which she could not free herself. The beeping stopped, and she felt a touch on her head. She flinched away from it, adrenaline surging through her body. The spider!\n\u0026ldquo;Joy!\u0026rdquo; Annette shouted. \u0026ldquo;Stop thrashing and WAKE UP.\u0026rdquo;\nJoy recognized the voice, and tried to turn her head towards it. She felt something rub along her chin, and slowly forced her arm to her face. She felt the float that was around her neck, and realized that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t in cotton\u0026ndash;she was in water. She focused her full efforts into opening her eyes. She felt one eyelid flutter and she nearly cried out with happiness. She blinked again, and light crashed into her eyes. She felt moisture on her face, and she could now feel the water all around her body.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s coming to,\u0026rdquo; Brent said.\nJoy blinked again and saw the faces of her friends as well as two strangers she didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize. She opened her mouth to speak, but her dry throat allowed only a croak to emerge.\n\u0026ldquo;Give her some water,\u0026rdquo; Annette urged.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s IN water,\u0026rdquo; one stranger answered. The other, taller stranger disappeared for a second and returned with a plastic bottle of water and handed it to Annette.\nJoy let Annette dribble the water onto her lips, licking them greedily. As her awareness grew, she also discovered that she was hungry. No, she was starving!\n\u0026ldquo;Mac?\u0026rdquo; asked Joy, her voice raspy and weak.\n\u0026ldquo;Right beside you,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered, turning Joy\u0026rsquo;s body so that she could see him.\n\u0026ldquo;Food?\u0026rdquo; Joy croaked, after being reassured at seeing a young but haggard looking Mac floating next to her.\n\u0026ldquo;What would you like?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Anything!\u0026rdquo; Joy croaked again, louder now that her voice was returning.\nThe two strangers both dropped from sight, and Joy heard them as they scrambled away from the water where she floated. A second later, she heard a heavy door open and close, the echoing, dull sound suggesting they were underground.\n\u0026ldquo;Where?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked as Annette fed her more water.\n\u0026ldquo;Safe, an island in the lower Chesapeake Bay, an old friend\u0026rsquo;s house, his private aquarium,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered with the standard protocol.\nJoy continued drinking the water as Annette fed it to her, increasing both her strength and her awareness. A few moments later, the two strangers reappeared in her vision and began handing Annette bottles. Annette opened one of them, and held it to Joy\u0026rsquo;s lips. As the thick, chalky fluid oozed into her mouth, Joy fought the urge to spit it out. She recognized the flavor, knowing it was exactly what her body needed. Ensure!\nHow do old people drink this shit, Joy wondered, forcing herself to drink it.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry, but we figured that since you hadn\u0026rsquo;t eaten in several days, you probably needed the calories and minerals in this stuff,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, watching Joy choke down the liquid.\n\u0026ldquo;Again,\u0026rdquo; said Joy, her voice stronger now but her hunger overwhelmed all other sensations.\nAnnette opened another bottle of the vile, white liquid and lifted it to Joy\u0026rsquo;s lips. Joy raised her hand from the water and took the bottle from her friend. She tilted it back, forcing the soupy concoction into her body, feeling her body react to the first food she had eaten in days. She took a third bottle, forcing that down, her body now responding with speed and power to her commands.\n\u0026ldquo;Save the chocolate for Mac,\u0026rdquo; Joy said in a clearer voice, her strength returning with miraculous speed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll take the vanilla; he hates vanilla.\u0026rdquo;\nAnnette returned the dark bottle to Jackson\u0026rsquo;s waiting hand and handed her another pale white bottle of Ensure. She downed that one and felt the hunger beginning to back off. She looked at her hand as she took the now empty bottle away from her lips. She could see that her hands had returned to the smooth, even complexion of her youth. The veins were still visible, probably because she had been starving to death, but the color and texture of her skin were the same as when she was a girl. She saw the webbing between her fingers, and she knew that her final transition couldn\u0026rsquo;t be far off.\n\u0026ldquo;We have to wake Mac up,\u0026rdquo; Joy said urgently.\n\u0026ldquo;How?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;How did you wake me up?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We added a lot of minerals and chemicals to the water, and then you started twitching and struggling, and so I just shouted at you,\u0026rdquo; Annette said.\n\u0026ldquo;Shout at him,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t be unconscious when we change; we have to concentrate on the change.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Concentrating makes a difference to a microscopic parasite?\u0026rdquo; asked the tall thin stranger next to Annette.\n\u0026ldquo;Mer-organs,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, feeling her hunger rise again. \u0026ldquo;We develop proto-mer-organs and they respond to our psychosomatic system.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Annette mentioned those organs earlier,\u0026rdquo; said Jackson. \u0026ldquo;Mind and body, psychosomatic system, I get it. That\u0026rsquo;s why placebos work.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s more complex than that, but that\u0026rsquo;s a start,\u0026rdquo; agreed Joy.\nBrent reached over to the still unmoving Mac and started shaking and shouting at him.\n\u0026ldquo;Anything more solid?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Cold cuts?\u0026rdquo; the tall, thin, stranger offered as he extended a hand.\n\u0026ldquo;Jackson Baker,\u0026rdquo; Annette said as Joy took the proffered sliced ham and stuffed it into her mouth in large bites. \u0026ldquo;Jack to his friends. He\u0026rsquo;s a former computer scientist and programmer, and a collector of marine life. This over here is Kyle Johnson, a friend of Jack\u0026rsquo;s, and you know Brent,\u0026rdquo; she finished indicating each. Brent paused from his shaking and shouting to smile at Joy.\n\u0026ldquo;More,\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, her hand extended towards Jack.\n\u0026ldquo;Must be hungry,\u0026rdquo; Kyle observed in his Eastern Shore drawl.\n\u0026ldquo;You have no idea,\u0026rdquo; Joy muttered as she stuffed the food into her mouth as quickly as Jackson handed it to her.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re sure that the calcium count went down?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked into the short wave radio.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered from Jackson\u0026rsquo;s radio room in the main house. \u0026ldquo;We tracked all the counts, calcium-carbonate, sulfate, phosphate, all of them, and they all went down, but calcium went down the most.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, according to our data, that means that the microorganisms are firmly established within the tank,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;And you\u0026rsquo;re sure that the metallic counts went down an hour after you added the powdered versions?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Annette repeated. \u0026ldquo;We could only do crude measurements, but we tracked them all, aluminum, beryllium, copper, lead and magnesium. They all went down within an hour. Both Joy and Mac are now conscious, and they are working on regaining the body mass they lost. But nothing else seems to be happening.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s great!\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;We think that their bodies responded to the war for resources with the microorganisms by shutting down as much as possible to preserve basic body functions. That\u0026rsquo;s why they both regained consciousness once we stopped the war for resources.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s great now that they are both awake,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;But they are still weak and report extreme discomfort when they are out of the pool for any length of time. They say it\u0026rsquo;s like their skin is being burned off in the air.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not good,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;Are there any other symptoms?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;None that we can see,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;Both Joy and Mac are more irritable than normal, but that might be simply because they\u0026rsquo;re cooped up in the tank.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just like we were cooped up in the Moon Pool,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, remembering. \u0026ldquo;How long has the chemical conditions of the tank remained stable?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Over six hours,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that IS great,\u0026rdquo; answered Pat. \u0026ldquo;It confirms our data here, but with even more tightly controlled circumstances.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;More?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The Moon Pool and environs has millions of gallons of sea water flowing through it constantly,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;Now we have confirmation on the ratio of suspended metals to microorganism activity, whereas before we could only guess here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, we know exactly how much water and how many heavy elements were added,\u0026rdquo; Annette agreed, understanding. \u0026ldquo;But why hasn\u0026rsquo;t anything else happened, and why can\u0026rsquo;t they get out of the tank?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, but it could be because of the way the siren cells were introduced into their bodies, through an infection rather than by infusion.\u0026rdquo; Pat answered. \u0026ldquo;They swam through the Moon Pool, probably allowing some of the parasites to enter through a break in their skin or by swallowing water. They didn\u0026rsquo;t drink any mermaid milk, so their systems were never directly infused with live siren cells, only the viral form in the parasites. We think that eventually, a person needs actual mermaid milk to initiate the final change.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How are we going to get mermaid milk from the middle of the Pacific Ocean to the Chesapeake Bay?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Has Joy started lactating?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, she called it leaking, but its more like a slow drip than something she\u0026rsquo;s producing when someone suckles on her,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered. \u0026ldquo;Is that mermaid milk?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We hope so,\u0026rdquo; Pat answered, looking at Phoebe, Alexis, and Galina surrounding her. \u0026ldquo;How often is she lactating?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We only noticed it for the first time this morning,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered.\nThere was a brief pause, and Annette could hear the mermaids talking in low tones because Pat didn\u0026rsquo;t lift her finger from the call button.\n\u0026ldquo;We think Joy is probably producing enough siren cells within her own body so that she and Mac can start their transition,\u0026rdquo; Pat announced.\n\u0026ldquo;What do we need to do?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked, readying her pencil.\n\u0026ldquo;Actually,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with a smile, \u0026ldquo;Nothing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing?\u0026rdquo; Annette repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing YOU can do,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;They need to start feeding from one another. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take much, but they have to bump up their internal siren cell counts, over-load their bodies with them, and that should create a tipping point.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tipping point?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked.\n\u0026ldquo;A point of no-return,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;Once a certain level has been reached, the transition should be inevitable; nothing will stop it. But that high saturation needs to be reached.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, how does Joy feed on Mac,\u0026rdquo; Annette asked. She paused, and then added, \u0026ldquo;Oh, never mind. I figured that one out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Smart girl,\u0026rdquo; Pat said giggling.\n\u0026ldquo;Experienced girl,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered, giggling as well.\n\u0026ldquo;Radio back when they\u0026rsquo;ve finished,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll be here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wait,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;Is there any concern about their skin condition?\u0026rdquo;\nThere was another brief sound of discussion, and then silence as Pat released the call button.\n\u0026ldquo;Hello, Pat?\u0026rdquo; Annette said after a few moments of silence. \u0026ldquo;Do you copy?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Give us a minute here,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, after a second or two. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re looking up some stuff from the last data set.\u0026rdquo;\nAnnette sat in silence for a few more moments and then looked out the window to watch the gray clouds scurry across the bay. The radio room in the Baker house faced north, and the bay was wide this far down the Chesapeake. Annette could see a container ship lumbering up the bay, but it was a good deal further up the bay than the island upon which she sat.\nThe view from this window was mostly water, though the Eastern Shore was visible from any window looking east. She wondered how long it would take to swim to Mermaid Island. They probably could cut through the Panama Canal, but they would risk exposure, and the water was probably not the cleanest or clearest in the world. All that traffic. Ugh. The route all the way down to the Straits of Magellan didn\u0026rsquo;t appeal to her either. So cold down at the southern tip of South America, so close to Antarctica. She knew that the mers could tolerate extreme temperatures, but still \u0026hellip; cold!\n\u0026ldquo;Annette?\u0026rdquo; Pat\u0026rsquo;s voice crackled over the radio, interrupting Annette\u0026rsquo;s daydreaming.\n\u0026ldquo;Go ahead,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t find any anomalies that might explain that particular symptom,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, the worry present in her voice even over the short wave radio. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t like it, but there doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem much we can do about it. All the species of aquatic life that you\u0026rsquo;ve identified in the Baker Aquarium are also present in these seas, though some are the Atlantic variations. I hope it\u0026rsquo;s just a side effect of never having ingested an actual siren cell.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, they should try to initiate their transitions?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, and keep your fingers crossed,\u0026rdquo; Pat returned. \u0026ldquo;Good luck.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Roger, over and out,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, clicking off the radio.\n\u0026ldquo;Here we go,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself as she rose and headed downstairs towards the basement entrance to the tank.\nLen Simon looked down at the cell phone in his slightly shaking hand. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t his normal smart phone; it was a prepaid not-so-smart-phone. The dumb phone wasn\u0026rsquo;t why his hand was shaking. In the past twenty-four hours, Peter and Len, acting as rich American perverts, had met with Anjo, and guided to this brothel by Conjo, the ex-mole for Joy Simpson. Len remembered Conjo\u0026rsquo;s story as Michael Thompson had told it on the trip to Davao. Just like the mermaids, nothing seemed to prepare Len for the man when he finally met him.\nConjo was a tiny, wizened old man, and like an ancient Zen master, he seemed to radiate both strength and weakness at the same moment. Any questions or fears Len had were erased as he watched Conjo handle Anjo, the manager at the brothel in which the woman they suspected was Emma Henderson worked as a maid.\nWithin only a few short minutes Anjo had gone from a highly distrustful and reluctant pimp to an eager and open business partner. No, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t Conjo\u0026rsquo;s seeming weakness and frailty nor Anjo\u0026rsquo;s all too apparent sliminess that had Len\u0026rsquo;s hand shaking; it was the women.\nLen had seen dozens of women, some of them impossibly beautiful, and some of them shockingly young. All of them had the strangest look in their eyes, a frightening mixture of emptiness, fear, and hatred. That look had Len\u0026rsquo;s hand shaking. The women who paraded before them had not the slightest spark of pleasure in their eyes; none of the smiles seemed genuine, and fear clouded the features of each girl\u0026rsquo;s face.\nNever had he seen human life treated so cheaply, making him all the more eager to escape both from the brothel and from that label: human. Len knew that human life was cheap, especially in the face of poverty, but he had to force himself to confront it. The visceral cruelty he saw all around him turned his stomach, making his hands shake with anger.\nHe fought to control his body. Again he reviewed the plans they had made. Oh, God! What plans! It may be that every little boy pretends to be James Bond or some sort of hero, but when the fantasy becomes reality, the hopes and dreams of a little boy get smashed to smithereens.\nLen stifled a smile, remembering how he had balked when Michael and Mark first described how they hoped to rescue the girls from the brothel and capture Malaki and his men. What they had described would take five James Bonds, and Len knew that he, himself, was no James Bond! He didn\u0026rsquo;t want to go into the belly of the beast, but when all was said and done, Len could see why it had to be Peter and him that went into there.\nMichael Thompson was too recognizable throughout the Pacific, and Malaki knew him by name and face. Liz Wainwright was also recognizable, but more importantly, she was an unlikely consumer at a brothel, particularly since she was in a wheelchair. Conjo\u0026rsquo;s role had to be in the background, though he hinted that he would be coming from within the city with some sort of force after his signal. Conjo\u0026rsquo;s possible army would likely be armed only with knives and machetes rather than guns, so their plan had to work prior to Conjo\u0026rsquo;s arrival.\nThat left Peter and him as complete unknowns. They could act like anything and get away it, and they could pass off their inconsistencies as eccentricities. Besides, they were paying good money for a terrible and gruesome request, but no one would look past the money.\nNone of these thoughts seemed to comfort Len while sitting next to Peter, his hand shaking. They sat together in the plush parlor of the otherwise shabby and ugly brothel. The dark read furniture and gaudy lighting only seemed to reinforce the tawdry and ugly business undertaken on the premises. Len could see the dock extending into the bay, visible through the large picture window that faced east. He looked away from the window and back towards Anjo, flanked by two beefy guards.\n\u0026ldquo;No worry,\u0026rdquo; Anjo said to Peter and Len, rubbing his hands in anticipation.\n\u0026ldquo;Then you can meet our needs?\u0026rdquo; Peter asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sure!\u0026rdquo; Anjo said with his heavy accent. \u0026ldquo;But now two hundred thousand American.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You said twenty-five thousand yesterday,\u0026rdquo; Peter said.\n\u0026ldquo;No can lose many girls one night,\u0026rdquo; Anjo explained. \u0026ldquo;Many weeks pass before more girls \u0026hellip; come. This a business problem, only.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We appreciate your business problems, but the notice is short. We were expecting to consummate our deal tonight,\u0026rdquo; answered Peter in a surprisingly menacing tone.\n\u0026ldquo;I have orders,\u0026rdquo; Anjo said, spreading his hands helplessly. \u0026ldquo;I sorry. Orders from above.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We would like to negotiate,\u0026rdquo; Peter said.\n\u0026ldquo;Above no negotiate,\u0026rdquo; Anjo said.\n\u0026ldquo;Then I am afraid we will look elsewhere to satisfy our business,\u0026rdquo; Peter said, standing, nudging Len to stand as well.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait!\u0026rdquo; Anjo said, moving towards the door as though to block their leaving. \u0026ldquo;You no find this business anywhere else.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We can find this business right around the corner in Tugbok, Bunawan, Panabo, and Tori,\u0026rdquo; Len said, putting his hands in his pockets. \u0026ldquo;We can find this business in thousands of places all over the Philippines.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, but \u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Anjo answered, backing away. \u0026ldquo;I do many things \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\nAnjo stopped talking as a group of well-dressed men entered from one of the side rooms that surrounded the parlor, three small men, and five large ones. The larger ones spread out along two walls, casually checking out the room, the windows, and Len and Peter. One of the three smaller ones waved a hand at Anjo, who quickly scurried over to him. They whispered briefly, and Anjo and his two henchmen arranged themselves along the windows that faced the bay. A moment passed in silence as everyone carefully surveyed the new arrangement.\nAs Peter and Len stood near the center of the room, Len continued to toy with the phone in his hand, trying not to let his own fears show on his face. He kept remembering the most pain-in-the-ass-days as a young lawyer, and forced those emotions play across his visage. He tried to glance casually around the room too, and noted that the elegantly dressed henchmen were obviously carrying weapons beneath their shirts. The room suddenly felt hotter and stuffier than it had. The smaller man who looked the oldest (and the one Len hoped and feared would be revealed as Malaki) nodded at one of his associates, who spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;Business is business,\u0026rdquo; the small, Indian man who looked like an accountant said. Len could see that the man was clearly terrified. He shared a glance with Peter, and they both nodded imperceptibly: the older man was probably Malaki. Everything looked like the descriptions that Conjo gave.\n\u0026ldquo;With whom are we doing business?\u0026rdquo; Peter asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I am Sudhish, Mr. Dimaunahan\u0026rsquo;s personal secretary,\u0026rdquo; the young man explained.\n\u0026ldquo;And these other men?\u0026rdquo; asked Peter, nodding at the well-dressed but otherwise silent man.\n\u0026ldquo;Business is business,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish repeated.\nPeter watched the flicker of all the other men\u0026rsquo;s eyes as they all looked to the person they suspected of being Malaki Dimaunahan. He nodded at Len, and Len secretly pushed a speed-dial button on his phone.\n\u0026ldquo;We are prepared to do business,\u0026rdquo; Peter said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;But not at the price your associate has named.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The price is not negotiable,\u0026rdquo; answered Sudhish.\n\u0026ldquo;Might we be more flexible on the terms, then?\u0026rdquo; Peter asked.\nSudhish turned to the one they thought to be Malaki and lifted an eyebrow. This man leaned into his assistant\u0026rsquo;s ear and whispered something.\n\u0026ldquo;How flexible?\u0026rdquo; Sudhish asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Half now, and half after we are finished with our business,\u0026rdquo; Peter offered.\n\u0026ldquo;You have one hundred twenty-five thousand here?\u0026rdquo; Anjo asked, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;Business is business,\u0026rdquo; Peter answered. \u0026ldquo;We are prepared to do business.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Interesting,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said and his henchmen glanced at him, surprised, but then all of them straightened up and took a more forward stance as though ordered to stand at attention. Anjo\u0026rsquo;s two henchmen noticed the change and they too raised themselves on the balls of their feet.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t even think about it,\u0026rdquo; Len answered in his best, bored lawyer tones. \u0026ldquo;One press on this phone and a small army will descend on this place and rip it\u0026ndash;and the people within it\u0026ndash;apart until they find us or our bodies. It really isn\u0026rsquo;t worth it, Mr. Dimaunahan. We know the cost of business, but we\u0026rsquo;re not stupid. No one in this room wants anyone else in the world to know about our business, so let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can all avoid a call to a rescue team.\u0026rdquo;\nMalaki startled at the use of his name, and gave Peter and Len a more appreciative look.\n\u0026ldquo;Very interesting\u0026rdquo; Malaki said with a sickly smile, indicating that he had been thinking about taking their money. \u0026ldquo;However, I must insist that we get paid before we begin your business.\u0026rdquo; The henchmen all relaxed back into their neutral stance.\n\u0026ldquo;We must conduct our business tonight,\u0026rdquo; Peter said. \u0026ldquo;We can give you half now, and call to have the rest delivered while we are undertaking our business.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How long will your business take?\u0026rdquo; Malaki asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We normally like to take our time,\u0026rdquo; Peter said, looking at Len as though they were trying to explain how long it took to play a round of golf. \u0026ldquo;Six girls and two of us, oh, I\u0026rsquo;d say about three hours or so.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, about that,\u0026rdquo; Len agreed, but feeling sick nevertheless. \u0026ldquo;We like to enjoy ourselves.\u0026rdquo; Len thought back to when they first planned the rescue. They had wanted to take all the girls, but they couldn\u0026rsquo;t fit thirty-three girls in the Johanna. They had to settle for what they could do, and try to make sure they saved those they actually attempted to save.\n\u0026ldquo;And you can have the rest of the money delivered within those three hours?\u0026rdquo; asked Malaki.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, of course,\u0026rdquo; answered Len. \u0026ldquo;It just takes a phone call,\u0026rdquo; he finished waving the phone in front of him.\nMalaki thought it over. He had hoped to string these clients out, delay them by a day or so, so he could work on finding out more about them. He didn\u0026rsquo;t like this situation, but as he had been saying, business is business. He didn\u0026rsquo;t want to risk a quarter of a million dollars, but he also didn\u0026rsquo;t want one of his sons to show up and surprise him and his men. Not liking his options he said, \u0026ldquo;We must witness your business here this evening.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You share our tastes?\u0026rdquo; Peter asked, as though he might be talking about building model airplanes rather than watching young girls die.\n\u0026ldquo;Business is business,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;If you wish to delay full payment, then we will witness your business.\u0026rdquo;\nMalaki watched as Len and Peter conferred over the new terms, nursing the bad feeling he had about these two men. Malaki\u0026rsquo;s relatively long life in a business that tolerated few old men had been due, in part, to his uncanny intuition. Right now, his intuition was thumping like a brass band. He wondered if they had any connection to the disappearances of his sons, but nothing seemed obvious. His sons, as far as he knew, didn\u0026rsquo;t engage in snuff pornography, but he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t put it past them. Something was up \u0026hellip; something was wrong, and he wanted to be nearby, with his own men, to make sure things didn\u0026rsquo;t get further out of control.\n\u0026ldquo;If everyone is out on the dock, that changes everything,\u0026rdquo; Peter whispered to Len. \u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t rescue them if we\u0026rsquo;re being watched.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s alright,\u0026rdquo; argued Len. \u0026ldquo;It will put them right into the arms of the mers. It\u0026rsquo;s perfect!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But how will we coordinate or change our plans?\u0026rdquo; Peter insisted.\n\u0026ldquo;The mers are smart,\u0026rdquo; Len reassured him. \u0026ldquo;They will adapt our original plans to the new situation. We just have to make a show of how we plan to enjoy our festivities to give the mers long enough to come up with a new plan.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re sure about this?\u0026rdquo; Peter whispered, glancing over where Malaki and his men still watched them.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Len answered, feeling strangely calm. It was like when he was arguing a case, and the right evidence just clicked into place, and he just knew that it would go his way. He straightened up away from Peter and turned to Malaki.\n\u0026ldquo;We are normally very private men,\u0026rdquo; Len began, hoping his nervousness helped with the explanation he was about to give. \u0026ldquo;So, if you please, can you and your men arrange to be on the far ends of the dock, rather than on the same dock? We may have different tastes, but surely you can agree that the indulgence of our tastes must be as much our own as is possible.\u0026rdquo;\nMalaki glanced out through the windows at the brothel\u0026rsquo;s dock, which was now empty, as per the instructions these two men had given Anjo the previous evening. The dock was E-shaped and faced southeast, extending its fingers out into the bay, two long arms with the shorter one in the middle. Apparently, these two men were going to have sex with the girls in the water, and then they would drown them. Malaki never shied away from killing anyone, but this was a strange way to satisfy a kink.\n\u0026ldquo;You may use the center dock, and we will keep to the sides,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said. \u0026ldquo;Will that satisfy?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Len answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Then we do business,\u0026rdquo; Anjo said, clearly delighted with how things were going. \u0026ldquo;You pick girls?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Peter said, as he handed him a list they had made from their previous visit.\nAnjo made a show of trying to read the list, but Malaki saved him and took the paper from him. He looked it over for a moment. \u0026ldquo;There is one girl I\u0026rsquo;d like to ask that you remove,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;You have an interest in one of these women?\u0026rdquo; Peter asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, his youngest sister,\u0026rdquo; he finished with nod towards his assistant.\nSuhdish could not stifle the cry that rose from his throat, but nor could he stop Torro\u0026rsquo;s hand that clamped over his face as he took a step towards his boss. He immediately recognized the futility of any further struggle, and slumped in the arms of his captor.\n\u0026ldquo;Interesting,\u0026rdquo; Peter said, keeping his face impassive. \u0026ldquo;We had hoped to take all three sisters with us. That is part of our taste.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am in need of at least one,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said. \u0026ldquo;You can have the two others.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps she should join her brother in watching?\u0026rdquo; Peter suggested. \u0026ldquo;Would that be useful to you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are an interesting man,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said. \u0026ldquo;I believe it may be useful,\u0026rdquo; he said as he watched Sudhish sag further into his son\u0026rsquo;s arms. Yes, that would serve nicely.\n\u0026ldquo;Happy to be helpful,\u0026rdquo; Peter answered. \u0026ldquo;May we begin our business?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Malaki answered. \u0026ldquo;If you will answer me one more question. Why the old woman?\u0026rdquo; he asked pointing to one of the names, Emma, there was no last name.\n\u0026ldquo;I have some rather special tastes,\u0026rdquo; Peter said. \u0026ldquo;She reminds me of my mother,\u0026rdquo; he finished with what he hoped was his best evil look.\n\u0026ldquo;I think many men might share that particular taste,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;Do you wish to substitute another girl for the one I requested?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Peter said casually, his stomach secretly turning. \u0026ldquo;Having her watch is just as delightful. You see, the number isn\u0026rsquo;t important, it\u0026rsquo;s the circumstances that makes it special. You can\u0026rsquo;t just throw everyone into the belly of a whale, after all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Belly of a whale?\u0026rdquo; Malaki asked.\nPeter watched as Suhdish processed that last bit, and stifled a smile of his own when he saw the young man glance at himself and Peter with a new understanding. Conjo had done his work.\n\u0026ldquo;The sea takes and does not yield up its dead,\u0026rdquo; Peter said. \u0026ldquo;We like to play our games, have our special fun, before we let the sea have her dead. But the thrill comes from many sources, not just the obvious one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are strange men,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said. \u0026ldquo;But if you are prepared to do business, we should complete this transaction.\u0026rdquo;\nPeter nodded to Len, and Len took out the thick envelope he had in his pocket. He tossed it to Anjo who caught it and rifled through it quickly. \u0026ldquo;Real American,\u0026rdquo; Anjo said breathlessly.\n\u0026ldquo;Is it enough?\u0026rdquo; Malaki asked, impatiently.\n\u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t we let him count while we get started,\u0026rdquo; Len said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;If we\u0026rsquo;re short, we\u0026rsquo;ll double the difference in the second payment.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Gambler?\u0026rdquo; Malaki asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Never gamble,\u0026rdquo; Len said. \u0026ldquo;Not with money. It\u0026rsquo;s exactly one hundred, twenty-five thousand dollars. We thought something like this might happen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Interesting men,\u0026rdquo; Malaki repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;We try to be,\u0026rdquo; Len said as he made a show of dialing a number on the cell phone. \u0026ldquo;We try to be very interesting.\u0026rdquo;\nMac stretched himself in the water, feeling a power and flexibility he hadn\u0026rsquo;t felt since his early twenties. There was no pain, no hitching joints, no problems! His body felt completely rejuvenated. Well, his back was covered with his new gills, and he couldn\u0026rsquo;t seem to stay out of the water for any length of time, but that seemed a minor price to pay for the return of his youth. He kicked his legs and surfaced next to Joy.\n\u0026ldquo;God, this is my worst nightmare,\u0026rdquo; Joy exclaimed.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t want to join Sally and Eric as mers?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, drumming her fingers along the top of the plexiglass wall of the tank. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m ready to be a mermaid, but I can\u0026rsquo;t stand being trapped, at the mercy of these parasites. I just want to get out, go take a walk, anything!\u0026rdquo;\nMac looked carefully at his lover, now young but clearly agitated. They had tried several times to leave the tank, but within mere seconds, it seemed, they were overcome with an intense discomfort, almost like itching, but deeper and more painful, that covered their entire body. Nothing was visible to them; their skin looked perfect, young, pliant, and smooth. However, something was wrong. It had felt as though their skin might burn away.\n\u0026ldquo;Going for a walk would be a bad idea,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe we ever made it past that chair,\u0026rdquo; he finished nodding his head towards a chair that sat only a few feet away from the edge of the tank wall.\n\u0026ldquo;We might never WALK again,\u0026rdquo; Joy said with frustration.\nThey floated in silence for a moment.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Mac agreed. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a little bit terrifying.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not afraid; I just hate being trapped,\u0026rdquo; Joy repeated. \u0026ldquo;Walk or swim, but do something. This soaking and waiting is driving me crazy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my face is getting \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Mac started.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Joy said irritably, \u0026ldquo;mine too.\u0026rdquo;\nTogether they both let go of the side of the tank and slipped beneath the water, allowing their gills to collect oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. After a long time floating, Annette and Brent came into the chamber. Annette waved them to the surface as she entered.\n\u0026ldquo;Pat says you two should start feeding one another,\u0026rdquo; she said as they both surfaced together and looked down at their friends.\n\u0026ldquo;Why would that do anything?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve been eating all day.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;From our bodies,\u0026rdquo; Joy answered, immediately understanding. \u0026ldquo;So, I\u0026rsquo;m probably producing mermaid milk?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what Pat and the others concluded.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Great! Ready?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked turning to Mac.\n\u0026ldquo;Born ready,\u0026rdquo; he said smiling back at the lovely young woman floating next to him.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you want us to leave?\u0026rdquo; Brent asked, suddenly feeling awkward.\n\u0026ldquo;You can stay or go,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter to us. The mers seem to have very little modesty about them, and we might as well get used to it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Besides,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;You might as well see what you\u0026rsquo;re in for.\u0026rdquo;\nAnnette and Brent glanced at one another, and both came to the same decision at the same time. They joined hands and walked over to the cot Jack had set up and sat down.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s do it,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, as he kissed Joy soundly, feeling his own cock respond to the impending excitement.\nAs they sank beneath the surface once again, Joy was suddenly aware of how full her breasts were and how the salty water gave them more lift than they normally possessed. Her dark nipples oozed milk in anticipation of the feeding. She offered her right breast to Mac, and he began to suckle. The milk that had been barely present early that morning when they made love was now a torrent of fluid. As he suckled at her warm, heavy breast, he could feel the energy in Joy\u0026rsquo;s body rise as she reveled in the act of feeding. He could also feel a shift in his own body as the siren cells from Joy\u0026rsquo;s milk built up in his body. Mac drained one and moved on to the other. When he was finished, he could feel things were very different.\n\u0026ldquo;That was amazing,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, bubbles escaping from her mouth, her eyes lidded with passion.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Mac agreed, but as he was about to continue speaking, his body suddenly went into spasms, and his eyes went blank.\n\u0026ldquo;Mac!\u0026rdquo; Joy screamed, startled. Annette and Brent stood up and came to the edge of the tank.\n\u0026ldquo;Mac!\u0026rdquo; Joy repeated, bubbles rising from her mouth. She reached out to shake him. \u0026ldquo;You have to concentrate on the change! Wake UP!\u0026rdquo;\nMac\u0026rsquo;s eyes were unresponsive, but his body began to stiffen. Joy pressed her ear to his chest, hearing the reassuring thumping of his heartbeat. Joy noticed that small bubbles seemed to be reappearing all over his body, and she released him from the hug and shook him forcefully.\n\u0026ldquo;Mac?\u0026rdquo; she tried to get a response, but he was in some sort of trance or seizure. She hoped he wasn\u0026rsquo;t in pain. Mac\u0026rsquo;s body went into spasms again, and Joy felt a twinge in her own body. Not both of them! That would be a disaster!\n\u0026ldquo;Wake up, Mac,\u0026rdquo; she pleaded.\nHe remained unresponsive, but her twitch grew into an itch, and she discovered that it was an itch to vocalize. She remembered how Pat had described their first changes, and so she reached out a hand to touch him, and when she made contact, she closed her eyes and began to hum.\nAnnette and Brent watched with open mouths as Mac\u0026rsquo;s body formed a cross in the water, his legs stretching towards the bottom of the tank and his arms out stretched at ninety-degree angles from his torso. The sound of Joy\u0026rsquo;s humming was otherworldly, barely audible in the room, soft and sweet.\nAnnette noticed that the fish in the tank seemed agitated. They began to swim with greater energy, and several of the larger fish began to make a full circuit of the tank with some speed, the smaller fish darting among them. A few cuttlefish, normally shy and hidden, darted along the back of the tank, sharing in the agitation and energy. A few even shot out towards Mac and Joy, but then scuttled back into the reefs and rocks in which they normally hid.\nThe moments ticked by as they watched the slow, graceful ballet in the tank build in speed and intensity. They noticed that Mac and Joy had begun to spin, perhaps because of the fish that seemed to be generating a whirlpool effect.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my god,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s so beautiful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Brent agreed. \u0026ldquo;Should we call Jack and Kyle down?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, they can watch us change,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, her eyes shining as she watched her old friends spin in the tank.\nInside the tank, Joy kept her hand on Mac\u0026rsquo;s torso and focused her mind on his change. She imagined a black tail for him, with silver highlights, but the discomfort she had felt when they were out of the water had returned, a low-grade ache that throbbed over her entire body. She fought to concentrate, but the demands on her were too much. Her humming continued, but she couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep her mind focused on Mac. She closed her eyes and hummed.\nHummed.\nHummed.\nHummed.\n[What are they doing?] Mark asked, his surprise visible in his CHEW.\n[They\u0026rsquo;re lining up along the dock,] MuSu reported. [All of them. I have no idea what Peter and Len said to them, but whatever it was, it\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity we can\u0026rsquo;t pass up.]\n[I would like to trust this,] Mark said. [How much time do we have, do you think?]\nMark felt the connection weaken as MuSu directed his CHEW to someone else. A moment later, it returned.\n[Ten minutes,] he said.\n[Thanks,] Mark said. [How many bogies?]\n[Eleven bad guys, plus the six girls, our two, and one terrified assistant] MuSu answered.\n[What\u0026rsquo;s the arrangement?] Mark asked.\n[Nine guys are easily reached simply by jumping over them,] MuSu reported. [The two guys with one of the girls and the assistant are going to be harder to reach. Any leap will take you into the support beams for the brothel.]\n[How many beams?] Mark asked.\n[Hard to see,] MuSu said. [Looks like four, each about two and a half meters apart.]\n[Don\u0026rsquo;t move,] Mark said. [I\u0026rsquo;ve got an idea.]\nMark pushed himself up to the air, surfacing between Trixi and Binah; Homa was on the other side of Trixi. He looked up to The Johanna\u0026rsquo;s deck where he could see Michael silhouetted against the stars of the night sky.\n\u0026ldquo;A change in plans,\u0026rdquo; he said as loudly as he dared, the dock being only a few hundred meters from where The Johanna lay anchored.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s up?\u0026rdquo; Michael asked, leaning over the rail towards the dark water.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve got everyone, including Malaki, outside, on the dock,\u0026rdquo; Mark explained. \u0026ldquo;They are practically handing this to us. They are apparently going to watch Peter and Len have sex and then drown the girls. So, we\u0026rsquo;re going to go for a surprise attack, and take all the bad guys down at once. As soon as you see us attack, go full speed towards the dock and start picking up women. If we\u0026rsquo;re lucky, no one will be able to fire a shot.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think there might be more inside?\u0026rdquo; Michael asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Conjo said Malaki traveled with five plus his son, and Anjo normally just has two guys on hand,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s a cheap bastard.\u0026rdquo;? \u0026ldquo;Got it,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;What about the assistant?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll give the same signal as we planned, and hopefully Peter and the assistant will see it, and hopefully Conjo was able to tell him what to do,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;We can sort it out later, if not. We\u0026rsquo;re not going to kill anyone, hopefully.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good luck,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks,\u0026rdquo; Mark smiled. \u0026ldquo;Expect something about eight minutes,\u0026rdquo; and he disappeared beneath the surface of the water. Michael stood back up, looked at his watch, and then walked into the cabin. Liz looked up at him, her eyes shining with excitement.\n\u0026ldquo;All the bad guys are outside on the dock,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a perfect set up. We\u0026rsquo;re going to totally change the plans. As soon as the mers attack the bad guys, you gun the engines and head for the dock as fast as The Johanna will go. When you get close, swing around and I\u0026rsquo;ll start pulling the girls over the stern.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, cinching down the seat belt holding her in the captain\u0026rsquo;s chair, her useless legs folded underneath her. She punched a button and the sound of a winch began. A green light indicated that their anchor was coming up from the seafloor.\nMichael returned to the deck and lifted his binoculars to his eyes. He scanned the shoreline until he located the brothel and its dock. He could see half dozen girls of mixed races and ages, clustered together on the middle leg of the dock. Peter and Len stood among them. Four or five larger men stood at regular places along the two outside legs of the dock, and three smaller men and one women stood along the spine of the dock that ran along the maze of support poles and beams that lashed together to support the brothel\u0026rsquo;s seaward wall. He raised his hand, and then lifted his head to make sure that Liz could see him. She nodded at him, and he returned to the binoculars.\nEmma Henderson had only her hate to keep her alive. She hated men, and she hated one man in particular. She hated Anjo. She never learned the name of the man who captured and sold her to Anjo, so she simply hated Anjo. She stood on the dock with the other girls and the two strange men, one American and one Australian. She could see Anjo standing next to his boss, a man she supposed that she should also hate, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t really care about him. With Anjo it was personal. She was going to try to kill him before she died, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t know how or when. It didn\u0026rsquo;t matter to her; her hate was enough.\nWhen she had first arrived at the brothel, she half hoped and half feared that her daughters might also be there. For her son, she prayed that he met the same sad fate that her husband had. Death was better than what she suspected was in store for her son. He was young enough that these sick men would exploit him, and the thought of her son sexually servicing these bastards strengthened her hate. These sick men! God, how she hated men!\nOf her own experiences, she knew that she ought to be dead. First, she tried to stop her husband from being killed, and while she had been beaten badly, those thugs didn\u0026rsquo;t kill her. Second, when she arrived at Anjo\u0026rsquo;s brothel, some Muslim men who rented her then raped and beat her, and then threw acid on her. Anjo, she could tell, had expected her to die in the experience. It was then she learned the phrase \u0026ldquo;snuff sex.\u0026rdquo; But she didn\u0026rsquo;t die, and the other girls in the brothel nursed her back to health.\nShe devoted herself to those girls, mothering them, cleaning up after them, smuggling condoms and soap into their rooms so that they might try, as best they could, to protect themselves from the ravages of what amounted to female slavery. She hoped that by doing this it would hurt Anjo in some way. Twice she had even attacked one of Anjo\u0026rsquo;s clients when they had harmed one of her girls, but each time Anjo didn\u0026rsquo;t punish her because the men hadn\u0026rsquo;t paid extra for the privilege of harming his property. Men were both sick and selfish. Sick men. Now, in the darkness illuminated by the glowing windows of the brothel above, one of those sick men, the portly American was trying to get her attention. She turned her hate-filled gaze from Anjo to the American, and raised her scarred and misshapen face to his, ready to unleash her hatred upon him.\n\u0026ldquo;If you can understand English, please nod,\u0026rdquo; the man asked her in a whisper. On reflex she nodded, her anger suddenly quelled by his gentle question and manner.\n\u0026ldquo;For this next question you must use all your strength to keep your composure,\u0026rdquo; the man said. \u0026ldquo;I am actually here to help you, not hurt you. Are you ready for the question?? Emma blinked her eyes. She reexamined the man before her. He was a middle-aged man, a bit portly, but not an evil looking man. He looked like an accountant or lawyer. He seemed to have soft eyes. What was going on? She took a deep breath and nodded again.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you Emma Henderson?\u0026rdquo; the stranger asked.\nEmma nearly cried out but remembered his injunction. She blinked back tears that suddenly sprung to her eyes and nodded again.\n\u0026ldquo;Good. You\u0026rsquo;re not going to die, but I need you to sit on the edge of the dock with your legs in the water,\u0026rdquo; the man explained. \u0026ldquo;Can you ask all the other girls to do the same?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why should I trust you?\u0026rdquo; she whispered back to him, speaking English for the first time in months.\n\u0026ldquo;Because your children are on their way to rescue you,\u0026rdquo; the man said with a warm smile.\nEmma couldn\u0026rsquo;t help herself as her legs simply gave way and she fell to the dock with a thump. The henchmen laughed at her clumsiness, but Emma quickly composed herself and looked back up at this apparent rescuer. He simply nodded again towards the other girls, acting as though nothing was at all unusual.\nEmma sat up straight and ordered them all to sit close to her in the Cebuano language all the girls and their captors used to communicate. One of the Indian girls gave her a sharp look.\n\u0026ldquo;Why do they hold Vidya?\u0026rdquo; the girl whispered in English.\nEmma shrugged and looked back at the American.\n\u0026ldquo;How many of you speak English?\u0026rdquo; the strange man asked quietly as the girls started to huddle close together. \u0026ldquo;Please raise one finger carefully if you speak English.\u0026rdquo;\nAll the girls raised a finger.\n\u0026ldquo;Great,\u0026rdquo; Len said. \u0026ldquo;Please, I\u0026rsquo;m just as frightened as you are, but if you do as I ask, you will be very pleased with the result.\u0026rdquo;\nThe girls warily began to sit on the dock next to Emma, and when all were seated, both Peter and Len sat next to them. Peter began taking off his clothes, very slowly and folding them carefully, laying them on the dock beside him. He indicated to the girls that they should join him. When Len started taking off his clothes, the girls all joined in. All the henchmen that surrounded them now began joking about the girls and men who were awkwardly disrobing on the dock.\n\u0026ldquo;Go slowly,\u0026rdquo; urged Len. \u0026ldquo;Make them watch us.\u0026rdquo;\nGeeta Basra and her sister Rani sat down on the other side of Emma from the strange American. She glanced over to where they could see their brother and their youngest sister held between two other men. She toyed with the thought of trying to escape by swimming, but she couldn\u0026rsquo;t abandon her sisters or her brother, who was somehow connected to their own abduction, she could now see. Perhaps this American really was going to rescue them. She noticed that both Vidya and Sudhish were silently crying. She stifled her own tears, which would do no good at the present moment.\nGeeta looked around at the men who watched them, and she arched her back to thrust her breasts forward as she removed her top. She tried to catch her brother\u0026rsquo;s eye, but he was focused on the water beyond the dock and wasn\u0026rsquo;t looking at her. She looked at her sister, Rani, and thought about how their lives had spiraled down into this living hell.\nIn only a few months, she and her sisters had gone from upper middle class girls hoping to marry bright, professional young men to basest chattel, captive sex toys for the rich and perverted. She shuddered internally thinking about all the men she had serviced, even as she noticed that her breasts were still attracting the attention of most of the men on the other two docks.\nOf all the girls assembled on the dock, Geeta knew that she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be conceited in acknowledging that she was the most beautiful girl there. Well, if they were going to be rescued, she had better put on a show to keep the bad guys distracted. They were all naked now, and so she raised her arms above her head and shook her shoulders. She smirked at how easy it was to hold male attention as her breasts swayed on her chest.\nA sharp slap echoed across the dock as a pair of large red and orange colored flukes smacked the otherwise placid water a few yards from where Geeta was putting on her show. Sudhish saw the strange tail rise and fall, and he tightened his grip on his sister\u0026rsquo;s hand, wrenched his other hand from Torro\u0026rsquo;s grip, and jumped towards the strange tail, pulling his sister awkwardly out of Malaki\u0026rsquo;s grasp.\nAs they both leaped into the water, eleven magnificent creatures suddenly rose up from the bay in unison, one arching up over each of the eight henchmen standing on the two long docks, while three others arched over the leaping Sudhish and Vidya towards Anjo, Malaki, and his son.\nFlashes of color filled the night sky as each mer hit their mark, dull thumps echoing as flukes slapped into human bodies, a sharp barb at the top of those flukes piercing torso, shoulder, or leg. The mers hit seven men squarely on their backs, the mer-venom reaching their spines immediately and swiftly paralyzing them. They dropped like stones onto the dock. Two of them even fell into the water where they floated, face down, unmoving. But two of the henchmen only suffered indirect hits, in either their shoulder or leg, and in the seconds before the venom fully paralyzed them, they each drew out their guns and began firing, first at the mers and then at the prostitutes and their Johns.\n\u0026ldquo;Get into the water!\u0026rdquo; Len and Peter urged all the girls, shouting as loudly as they could.\n\u0026ldquo;Swim out into the bay! Towards that boat!\u0026rdquo; He pointed at the still distant Johanna, whose engines were now roaring into action.\nThe bullets were flying everywhere, and Len and Peter started pushing the shocked women into the water, one by one. Both of them ignored the bullets that whizzed by, but the seconds seemed like hours. A bullet zipped past Len\u0026rsquo;s ear and sploinked into the water near his shoulder. He reflexively dove into the water, resurfaced and tried to get the women to start making their way towards the approaching yacht. \u0026ldquo;Move!\u0026rdquo; he urged.\nMark felt his barb sink into Malaki\u0026rsquo;s flesh as he passed over him, hitting him squarely in the chest. He reached forward with his hands and grabbed one of the beams that supported the brothel above him, and twisted around the pole and flipped back out into the water. He saw Trixi perform a similar maneuver in the corner of his eye, and heard the reassuring splash when she tumbled back into the water next to him. He somersaulted quickly and pushed himself back up onto the dock. There he found Homa putting another dose of mermaid venom into the horizontal Malaki.\n\u0026ldquo;Into the water!\u0026rdquo; he ordered, feeling a bullet whiz by. \u0026ldquo;Take him to the boat,\u0026rdquo; he said, flinging Torro\u0026rsquo;s body into the water. Homa glared at her mate for a second, but when another bullet zinged past, she hopped quickly into the water, and tugged Torro underneath the surface as she went, the orange in her tail flashing in the dark water. Mark grabbed Malaki and threw him to the waiting Binah, who had given the first signal with her tail. Mark then rolled into the water, determined to stop the gunfire. The water filled with the sounds of struggle and panic as he swam towards the far dock.\n[Wong and MuSu got the two shooters a second time,] Trixi said to him a few seconds later. [Everyone is now paralyzed.]\n[Great,] Mark said back as he pulled a quick u-turn. [Let\u0026rsquo;s get going before more show up.]\n[I\u0026rsquo;ll get the Indian boy and his sister,] Trixi shot back and turned towards the spot where Sudhish and Vidya struggled in the water.\n[Binah and Homa,] Mark sent out as he sped back towards Trixi. [The shooting has stopped, you can let the bad guys breathe. The Johanna should be nearby. Head for it. Everyone else who can hear me, leave the bad guys where they are, and get to the girls and Len and Peter! Get everyone on The Johanna as quickly as possible!]\nMark pulled up next to Trixi as Sudhish and his sister floundered in the water and rose up beside them.\n\u0026ldquo;Relax!\u0026rdquo; Mark said loudly enough to get their attention. \u0026ldquo;Take off your shoes and start swimming for that boat,\u0026rdquo; he urged, pointing at the fast approaching Johanna. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve got to get out of here quickly before we attract any more attention.\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish and Vidya stopped struggling as they felt Trixi and Mark support them in the water. The beauty of the mer\u0026rsquo;s eyes and faces distracted both, and they simply stared at their rescuers. They were jolted out of their reverie by two loud shrieks, one joyful and one horrified. All four, both mer and human, turned and looked towards the jumble of heads, limbs, and tails near the center dock where the MuSu\u0026rsquo;s and Wong\u0026rsquo;s pods had joined the soon-to-be-former-prostitutes and Len and Peter in the water.\nAn elderly woman with a face horrifically disfigured by scars and burns was screaming the names of her daughters as she hugged three mermaids fiercely. Emma Henderson hadn\u0026rsquo;t quite figured out that she now had three daughters rather than two, but her joyful screams were in dramatic contrast to the horrified wails of Rani Basra as she tried to lift the lifeless head of her sister out of the water. Shen and Lin where supporting Rani and her sister while Esmée and Wong tried to help the other girls maintain their composure. Rani turned the bloody head of Geeta to the side and saw the blood oozing from a small hole in her left temple. She pressed her hand to the wound, and screamed \u0026ldquo;Geeta!\u0026rdquo; over and over again.\nEmma finally heard the horrified screams of Rani and stopped her own joyful celebration, breaking away from her daughters to swim towards the stricken Rani.\n\u0026ldquo;Mom,\u0026rdquo; Rikki interrupted. \u0026ldquo;Let the mers handle this, they might be able to help her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mers?\u0026rdquo; Emma said, slowly putting everything together, the flashes of tails, fins, and flukes that she\u0026rsquo;d barely registered when Len had pushed her into the water. \u0026ldquo;As in mermaids?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s right, Mom,\u0026rdquo; Rikki said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re mermaids, all of us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mermaids?\u0026rdquo; Emma repeated. \u0026ldquo;All of you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Mom,\u0026rdquo; Emma, her daughter, said. \u0026ldquo;Even me \u0026hellip; your son \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s me, Martin.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Martin?\u0026rdquo; Emma repeated, and then she promptly fainted.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll take her to the boat,\u0026rdquo; Emma said, gathering her into her arms. \u0026ldquo;Start helping the other girls.\u0026rdquo;\nShen, meanwhile, had tried to force her breast to Geeta\u0026rsquo;s lips, but Rani wouldn\u0026rsquo;t release her sister from her grasp. Lin pressed her fingers into Geeta\u0026rsquo;s artery, and after a second or two, she shook her head at her sister. Shen sagged, understanding that they could do nothing to save the unfortunate young woman. She glanced over to Mark and shook her head.\n\u0026ldquo;Noooooooooooooooo!\u0026rdquo; Sudhish screamed, realizing what had happened. \u0026ldquo;No, no, no, noooooooooooooo.\u0026rdquo; He struck out for his dead sister, but Mark grabbed him and shook him.\n\u0026ldquo;We have to go,\u0026rdquo; he shouted.\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; Sudhish argued as he struggled to free himself. \u0026ldquo;I have to save Geeta!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Mark said, holding him firmly. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s dead. And if we delay longer, you risk the lives of your remaining sisters and everyone else.\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish blinked, and looked around. He could see the paralyzed bodies of most of the henchmen, Anjo and his thugs, but not his boss or Torro.\n\u0026ldquo;Malaki and his son are being taken to the boat,\u0026rdquo; Mark said in response to Sudhish\u0026rsquo;s unasked question. \u0026ldquo;We will handle them later. First, let us help you. Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We must kill those men,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said, feeling anger erupt in his chest. \u0026ldquo;They killed my sister.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We will not kill unless we must,\u0026rdquo; Mark said firmly. \u0026ldquo;Go, save your remaining sisters.\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish blinked again, and nodded unconsciously, not realizing he was agreeing with the merman who held his shirt so that he didn\u0026rsquo;t sink. He shook his head, and nodded again, consciously and turned to his sister.\n\u0026ldquo;Just lie on your back with your face to the air,\u0026rdquo; Trixi said to both Sudhish and Vidya. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll do the rest.\u0026rdquo; She sank beneath Vidya, supporting her, and began to swim for the boat.\nThe Johanna thundered up to the dock, turned hard to port, swinging the stern towards the swimmers struggling towards her, some on their own, some dragged or pushed by a mer. Michael knelt on the aft swimming platform, reaching out to the swimmers who were still several meters away.\n\u0026ldquo;Cut the engines,\u0026rdquo; he shouted up to Liz, who had already cut the throttle.\nAfter the engines grew silent, he started pulling the swimmers up as they arrived. The mers who had been helping and guiding them now forming a channel to guide the remaining swimmers. Emma regained consciousness as she was being handed up to Michael, and she scrambled into a corner of the main deck and hugged her knees. Peter and Len were the last to clamber up onto the deck, the five remaining girls clustered around the still shocked Emma in fear and amazement. Peter and Len turned around, still naked, and stood next to Michael facing the mers.\n\u0026ldquo;O.K.,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;Send them up.\u0026rdquo;\nMark, Wong, and MuSu took Torro from Binah and flung his body towards the men on the swimming deck. Torro\u0026rsquo;s limp body looked like a rag doll as he landed at their feet, his head thumping against Michael\u0026rsquo;s leg.\n\u0026ldquo;I hope that hurt,\u0026rdquo; Len said as he reached down to lift Torro up onto the main deck.\n\u0026ldquo;He meant Torro, not you,\u0026rdquo; Peter explained, looking at Michael.\n\u0026ldquo;I know what he meant,\u0026rdquo; Michael smiled at both men as they hoisted Torro up over the aft rail. Torro\u0026rsquo;s head thumped again as they let him fall to the deck behind them. The three men shared a satisfied smile, and then turned back to the water. The mers casually tossed up Malaki in a similar fashion.\n\u0026ldquo;The venom should last for a few hours,\u0026rdquo; Mark said, as Peter and Len clambered up onto the main deck after they tossed Malaki.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s move out and further down the bay, and we\u0026rsquo;ll give them another dose. Hopefully, it\u0026rsquo;s dark enough that few people noticed us,\u0026rdquo; he finished.\n\u0026ldquo;The shooting didn\u0026rsquo;t help,\u0026rdquo; Michael said as he hopped up onto the main deck. \u0026ldquo;But this is a section of town were guns aren\u0026rsquo;t unusual.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s hope so,\u0026rdquo; Mark agreed. He glanced around at the mers, and in unison all of them flipped back under the water.\nThe lack of moonlight left the Moon Pool in inky blackness, but the mers in the pool were seeing one another with their mer-senses, not their eyes. Their world was sparkling with delicate lines of energy, dancing among and between them, and each mer was a soft, mer-shaped blob of glowing energy. The new mers still marveled at how impoverished their human senses had been. Everyone had just returned to the caves after the hearing amazing report of the rescue in Davao, and the pods settled in for the night.\n[Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I\u0026rsquo;m sure that they are fine,] Pat said with as little exasperation as she could manage. She felt backwards with her mer-senses checking in on her own pod, and could sense Maureen fussing.\n[But they didn\u0026rsquo;t check in earlier today,] Jaclyn said, looking at her pod-mates for support.\n[They weren\u0026rsquo;t supposed to check in until the day after they set The Device, which may or may not have been today,] Pat argued. [We tried to contact them, after we were done with Trixi. You were there! What else do you want me to do?]\n[Pat?] Danni interrupted.\n[Bring her over, dear] Pat answered.\n[Try it again,] Jaclyn said.\n[CHEW doesn\u0026rsquo;t work like a radio,] Pat tried to explain patiently. [They have to be similarly arranged and ready to receive long distance CHEW or we will just be wasting our energy. They obviously haven\u0026rsquo;t yet finishing setting The Device. We\u0026rsquo;ll try again tomorrow morning, at the time we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to, and hopefully we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to contact Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pod.]\n[I just wish we could have gone with them,] Janice said, pouting.\n[We would have been more of a burden to them,] Jaclyn said, putting a soothing hand on Janice\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. [We barely stay out of trouble here, and we\u0026rsquo;re learning as fast as we can about life as a mer.]\n[You\u0026rsquo;ll be able to go with them next time,] Pat said, as she gathered the fussing baby mermaid from Danni\u0026rsquo;s arms. [You guys are still newbies, sort of like this one, and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to learn about being a mer, not the least of which is what is edible and what\u0026rsquo;s not. You will learn quickly, but it still takes time.]\n[I suppose you\u0026rsquo;re right,] said Janice, a touch of fatigue in her CHEW. [There\u0026rsquo;s still so much we have to do here before all hell breaks loose.]\n[We\u0026rsquo;re going to be fine,] Pat said, as she guided Maureen to her breast. The little mermaid quieted immediately and began to feed. [That\u0026rsquo;s it, little one. Good girl. We cannot keep the secret of our existence for much longer, especially with all the witnesses, criminal though they may be, in Davao. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think all hell will break loose, we\u0026rsquo;re not powerless.]\n[I just worry,] Jaclyn. [This being a mother thingy is still new to me.]\n[You\u0026rsquo;re not a mother yet, my dear,] Pat said gently. [And I\u0026rsquo;m just the former man who can tell you that.]\n[Yeah, I can see that you are,] Jaclyn agreed. [Someday I will actually be one, but not soon.]\n[Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ll be a grandmother before you get to be a mother,] Janice said teasingly. [Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that be amazing.]\n[It would be miraculous,] Jaclyn said.\nThe Johanna drifted in the open sea, about 150 miles east of Davao City. In the time it had taken them to clear out of Davao Bay, Michael and crew had learned something of the lives of these women before their rescue. Geeta Basra had been kidnapped about three months ago and her sisters were taken a few weeks later, whereas Emma had been captive for nearly eighteen months.\nLen and Peter had picked the two other girls because they looked so young. Maja, a Filipino girl, was only sixteen years old, though held captive for nearly two years. Antonia, a New Zealander, was eighteen years old, and she had been a captive for over three years. Both girls proved surprisingly resilient, however, and seemed much less worse for wear than Emma or the Basra sisters. Given that all the girls felt \u0026ldquo;ruined\u0026rdquo; by their work in the brothel, all of them had shared their contempt for returning to a civilization that had not only failed to rescue them but also had likely given them up for dead.\nThey had stopped here, briefly, so that the mers could report back to Mermaid Island and donate some more venom to be used on Malaki and his son. MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod donated most of the venom because mers had to do that out of the water, and his pod spent most of their time talking to Emma as they milked their own barbs, trying to cram the news of over a year and a half of their lives into fifteen minutes.\nThe triplets proved both effective storytellers and venom providers, and everyone learned a lot in that brief period. The girls had wanted to heal their mother, but MuSu and the others persuaded them to wait because it would take time and organization to sort out who would be with whom, and if Emma had mermaid milk in her body, she might have to bond to one of the men on board. Emma had been adamant that she would not bond to any man. No one disagreed with her.\n\u0026ldquo;We can make Palau by later this afternoon,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, his feet trailing in the water as he sat on the swimming deck, talking to the mers. They still were difficult to see in the pre-dawn dusk, the sky to the east just barely showing the glimmers of a new day. \u0026ldquo;From there it\u0026rsquo;s about four or five days, depending on wind and weather, to Mermaid Island.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then let\u0026rsquo;s meet you later tonight about 300 miles east by southeast from Palau,\u0026rdquo; Mark said. \u0026ldquo;You probably don\u0026rsquo;t need to keep Malaki and his son paralyzed, but if you keep putting a little bit in the water they drink, they\u0026rsquo;ll be too weak to give you much trouble.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually,\u0026rdquo; Michael said with some sympathy, \u0026ldquo;I think they have more to fear from Emma, Sudhish, and his sisters than we have to fear from them. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing how quickly most strong men become weak once their hired muscle is taken away.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not surprising to me,\u0026rdquo; Mark laughed. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t tell you how many times that has proven true. Alright, see you in fourteen hours. MuSu,\u0026rdquo; Mark called out loudly. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s time. We have to get going.\u0026rdquo;\nMuSu\u0026rsquo;s head popped up from the main deck. \u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; he answered. Mark could hear the sounds of kisses, gentle sobs, and hugs as the Henderson girls said goodbye to their mother. A few seconds later MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod launched themselves over the side railing and arched towards the dark ocean in graceful dives, each one slicing silently into the water after the other. They quickly appeared behind Mark\u0026rsquo;s pod, bobbing with the others.\nMichael stood up and watched as the mers received some signal from Mark and then moved in perfect unison to disappear beneath the waves. He paused to wonder how they did that and what it would be like to be part of such a group. Soon enough, he thought to himself. He turned and saw the early morning sun just breaking through the far horizon, the day looking like it would be calm and beautiful. Michael turned back towards the main cabin.\n\u0026ldquo;Peter,\u0026rdquo; he said as he clambered over the aft rail. \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you take first shift at the helm and Liz can keep you company. Len and I will get some shut eye in the starboard cabin.\u0026rdquo;\nHe surveyed the five women still clustering around Emma on the floor of the main deck, each of them now clad in one of his tee shirts that functioned, more or less, like a summer pullover on the smaller women. Sudhish was also among that group, still surrounded by his two remaining sisters, and he was wearing one of Peter\u0026rsquo;s swim trunks. Len and Peter, like himself, had returned to their customary swim trunks and tee shirt. Everyone looked tired, Michael knew he needed a few hours of sleep or he would become useless, and then the rescue effort would have been for naught.\n\u0026ldquo;With Malaki and his son in the port cabin, I think four of you could sleep in the main stateroom forward,\u0026rdquo; Michael suggested. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a master suite, and the bed could fit four comfortably. Two others could sleep in the starboard cabin. Everyone ought to try for a few hours rest. We have a long journey ahead of us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maja and I can take the galley,\u0026rdquo; Antonia said, rising and helping Maja to her feet. \u0026ldquo;Those are beds aren\u0026rsquo;t they?\u0026rdquo;? \u0026ldquo;Yes, but Len and I can take those!\u0026rdquo; Michael protested.\n\u0026ldquo;No, no,\u0026rdquo; Antonia insisted. \u0026ldquo;You need your rest, and you\u0026rsquo;ve done more than enough for us.\u0026rdquo; They both turned and descended the gangway towards the galley.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll share the cabin,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; said Len. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the one with a single, full-sized bed, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\n\u0026ldquo;Great,\u0026rdquo; said Len with a sigh.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on,\u0026rdquo; Emma urged the Basras. \u0026ldquo;You need some sleep.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish sobbed.\n\u0026ldquo;Not sleeping will not make her come back,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;You have to sleep.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish repeated, softly.\nRani looked at Emma and then at Vidya, and the three of them stood up and then pulled Sudhish to his feet. They gently guided the sobbing young man towards the forward stateroom. Emma held back for a moment and turned back to others.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you,\u0026rdquo; she said, her eyes shining with emotion. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d given up hope.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thank your daughters,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;They were sure they\u0026rsquo;d find you, and find you they did.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My daughters,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;I still \u0026hellip; they all \u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Give it time,\u0026rdquo; Liz said from her chair. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re all headed into an uncertain future. I\u0026rsquo;m sure you and your daughters will figure out how everything will best fit together.\u0026rdquo;\nThey heard Sudhish sob as his sisters tried to get him to lie down on the bed. \u0026ldquo;No, the floor is all I deserve,\u0026rdquo; he wailed.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s in for a rough time,\u0026rdquo; Peter said. \u0026ldquo;But he can\u0026rsquo;t take all the blame upon himself like that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s cultural,\u0026rdquo; Len said. \u0026ldquo;But he\u0026rsquo;ll pull through. There\u0026rsquo;s something about those kids that makes me think so.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll make sure he\u0026rsquo;s alright,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;I know how he feels.\u0026rdquo; She turned and entered the forward cabin and shut the door.\n\u0026ldquo;That woman is amazing,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I could have survived through what she has gone. Come on, let\u0026rsquo;s get some shut eye. You two gonna be able to handle things for a few hours?\u0026rdquo; He nodded to Peter, and the bronzed elderly chemist saluted him.\n\u0026ldquo;We will be fine,\u0026rdquo; said Liz, as she maneuvered her wheelchair next to Peter. \u0026ldquo;Go sleep.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;See you in a few hours,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, and turned and headed for the gangway and the starboard cabin.\n\u0026ldquo;Those two kids, Maja and Antonia, they are very brave. I\u0026rsquo;m glad we picked them,\u0026rdquo; Len said. \u0026ldquo;I only wish we could have saved more of them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Next time,\u0026rdquo; Liz said. \u0026ldquo;Perhaps we\u0026rsquo;ll make a nation of mers from the downtrodden, enslaved, and outcast?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You know, for an heiress, you often surprise me,\u0026rdquo; Len said as he turned to follow Michael below.\n\u0026ldquo;For a lawyer, you always surprise me,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, her eyes laughing.\nThe mers found a school of orange roughy and alfonsino swimming halfway down a sea ridge and stopped for a much-needed breakfast. Trixi still had to steel herself to take the first bite into a still squirming fish, but her hunger and her mer-senses compelled her to tear into the flesh of the alfonsino still squirming in her hands. She looked over to Homa and Binah effortlessly and ruthlessly enjoying their meal, bits of fish floating in the water near their faces. Once she pulled the scaly skin away from the flanks of the fish, the sweet, soft flesh tasted like tangy butter in her mouth. Sushi was better when it was off the bone, she thought. It was getting it off the bone that she didn\u0026rsquo;t like.\nShe noticed Mark finish his own breakfast and look over to her. Her heart thumped a little bit harder as he swam up to her, his beautiful black and purple tail flashing in the pale light of the sun still visible at fifteen meters. She still marveled at how much her life had changed. Only a short time ago, she was a transsexual prostitute, and now she was a genetic female, a genetic mermaid, actually, but female finally! She felt a bit of scale caught in between two of her teeth and quickly spit it out.\n[Still not your thing, eh?] He said.\n[You\u0026rsquo;re my thing,] Trixi said, letting the last of the fish float away and feeling her heart surge when he put his arm around her.\n[You did good,] Mark said, giving her a kiss. [Torro went down like a rock.]\n[I had a great teacher,] Trixi said. [The best.]\n[You have natural instincts,] Mark said, pulling her in close.\n[I love natural instincts,] Trixi said, as she pressed herself into her pod-mate.\n[Perhaps we should explore some of them,] Mark suggested, nipping at her neck.\n[We swim faster than that boat, right?] Trixi said, swooning at his love bites and loving how her own soft curves were pressing into Mark\u0026rsquo;s chiseled male body.\n[If we want to,] he said, moving his hands along the narrow of her waist, teasing the edge of her tail and torso.\n[Then we have some time here for some natural instincts?] She asked in her most innocent voice.\n[I say yes to natural instincts,] Homa said, pressing her own body up against theirs.\n[Me too,] Binah agreed as she finished off her roughy and joined them.\n[I live to make my mermaids happy,] Mark said, tugging on his vent flap and freeing his rapidly telescoping cock.\nTrixi turned her wide hips towards his, and felt Homa and Binah position themselves on either side. She put her arms around Mark\u0026rsquo;s neck and let him guide her hips towards his, his strong hands firmly grasping the slopes of her waist just above her pelvic bone. Homa\u0026rsquo;s tail wound around hers, and Trixi felt the fringes of Homa\u0026rsquo;s flukes vibrate against her lower tail, just above her root, where her ankles used to be. Binah\u0026rsquo;s tail fluttered against theirs as she pressed herself into Mark\u0026rsquo;s other pelvic fin, her dark breasts beginning to leak white, mermaid milk into the water.\n[I\u0026rsquo;m so happy I got rescued,] Trixi said as Mark\u0026rsquo;s cock eased into her.\n[Me too,] Homa said, her hips twitching as Mark\u0026rsquo;s fin vibrated in her vent.\n[Yeeessssssssssssss,] Binah said, her orgasm overtaking her.\n\u0026ldquo;You did good, Len,\u0026rdquo; Michael said as he lay down on the full sized bed in the small, cramped cabin. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m proud of you.\u0026rdquo;\nLen blushed at the praise, and wondered again at the journey he was undertaking. He looked over at Michael who was smiling at him with what looked like genuine affection and pride. He felt really good, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t feel that way often. The upwelling of gratitude and affection still seemed strange to him, even more so because another man was causing him to feel this way.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be embarrassed,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;You should feel good.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I DO feel good,\u0026rdquo; Len said, looking away. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m embarrassed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, understanding. \u0026ldquo;Sorry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Len said, sitting down on the other edge of the bed. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be sorry. This will all just take \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Time,\u0026rdquo; said Michael, rolling onto his back and putting his hands beneath his head. \u0026ldquo;And a little mermaid milk.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; Len agreed, turning onto his back and lying down next to Michael. \u0026ldquo;A lot of mermaid milk.\u0026rdquo;\nThey lay in silence for a moment. Len felt the oddness press heavily on his chest, even as his penis betrayed some of his conflicting feelings. He turned away from Michael onto his side and tucked his stiffening penis back between his legs.\n\u0026ldquo;Have you thought about it much?\u0026rdquo; Michael asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, all the time, it seems,\u0026rdquo; Len answered, not moving, but conscious of the fact that he was holding his legs together as if they were already forming a tail. He deliberately bent one knee forward, over the other. \u0026ldquo;I think it\u0026rsquo;s gotten worse since we actually met the mers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you think about it?\u0026rdquo; Michael said after a moment of silence. There was no reply from Len. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have to answer if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, no,\u0026rdquo; Len said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just thinking. Liz and I talked about it a while ago, but it\u0026rsquo;s become so much more \u0026hellip; more \u0026hellip; real in the last two days.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She told me about the book,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;I think that\u0026rsquo;s adorable.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, I guess,\u0026rdquo; said Len, feeling even more embarrassed. A few more moments passed in silence.\n\u0026ldquo;I think this will be easier once we start the process of transformation,\u0026rdquo; Len said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not really comfortable with the whole \u0026hellip; two men, thing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; Michael said lightly. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t think of the two men thing, think about the mermaid you\u0026rsquo;d like to become.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s easy,\u0026rdquo; Len said. \u0026ldquo;Kelly Brook. You probably think that\u0026rsquo;s silly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, but that was a terrible movie,\u0026rdquo; Michael said laughing. \u0026ldquo;I do like your taste in mermaids; she was beautiful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, I could never bear to see the movie. I heard it was so bad, but she looked stunning in the pictures I saw.\u0026rdquo; Len said. \u0026ldquo;I think it will be easier when I\u0026rsquo;m more like her and less like \u0026hellip; me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think I will like that,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, his own cock twitching to life as he remembered that terrible movie, Fishtales or something like that. \u0026ldquo;It will be strange having someone who will look like Kelly Brook but will sound as intelligent, wise, and funny as you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not so sure on the wisdom,\u0026rdquo; Len answered. \u0026ldquo;I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m about to throw away everything I\u0026rsquo;ve ever been, ever wanted to be, so that I can become a mermaid. It sounds most unwise when I say it out loud.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You saw them,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;Do you really think the decision is unwise? Their beauty, their power, their eyes \u0026hellip; they are just so \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I know,\u0026rdquo; said Len, feeling his penis stiffen further. \u0026ldquo;It seems too wonderful to be true, which is one reason why I hope it\u0026rsquo;s not foolish to do what we\u0026rsquo;re about to do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not going to do anything tonight, so get some sleep,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll need it. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I\u0026rsquo;ll wait until you\u0026rsquo;re more like Kelly and less like Leonard before much else happens.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks,\u0026rdquo; Len answered, gratified that Michael had put that issue to rest for the moment.\n\u0026ldquo;What about your new name?\u0026rdquo; Michael asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Now that, I\u0026rsquo;ll have to think about it,\u0026rdquo; Len answered.\nJackson wandered down to the viewing area about an hour after Mac had started his transition. By that time the energy in the tank had built considerably. Mac and Joy were spinning near the center of the tank, a few meters back from the glass wall that separated the tank from the rest of the room. The fish in the tank were still swimming in a large circle, in the same direction as the spinning couple. Below the spinning humans, a dark brown cuttlefish swayed lifelessly in the water, looking either stunned or dead, no one was sure.\nThe tiny bubbles that had appeared on both Mac and Joy over the last few days now appeared to be erupting from Mac\u0026rsquo;s skin all over his body. While the people observing had no point of comparison, the bubbles were about half as thick as the ones that had surrounded Jaclyn and Janice a few days previously in the Moon Pool. Mac was still easily visible behind the sheen and sparkle of the rising air bubbles. During the night, Annette had seen a vortex of bubbles spin down, like a minitornado, and spin the lifeless cuttlefish like a top. She hoped it wasn\u0026rsquo;t an omen.\nAt first, they saw little change in Mac, but over the course of the next twenty-four hours, the changes became more visible. Brent, Annette, Jack, and Kyle had taken turns watching over the tank as the day turned into night and then back into day. Early in the previous evening, the separation between Mac\u0026rsquo;s legs was no longer visible, and by the evening, they could clearly see the nubs of flukes and fins emerge along the tail, now nearly two meters long.\nAs the morning sun began to leak into the room from the skylights in the shed above, they could see that Mac\u0026rsquo;s tail was nearly complete, but that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the most dramatic change. His overall coloring had changed, every inch of his skin had changed, not just his new tail. His entire body, from the top of his forehead to the bottom of his flukes, was a near uniform, light mocha brown. Joy was still pale and white, her hand resting on his now dark torso. His hair was still dark brown, as it had been before, though now it hung, as with all the other mers, down past his shoulders in thick, slightly curling waves.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you think has happened?\u0026rdquo; Jackson asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I have no idea,\u0026rdquo; Annette answered. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re just going to have to wait and see.\u0026rdquo;\nA few more moments passed, then a terrific spasm gripped Mac\u0026rsquo;s body, and his brown tail flashed with energy as it arced above his head. Multicolored bioluminescence sparkled along his fringes. Joy stopped humming, her hand flying from Mac\u0026rsquo;s side as though she had been shocked. Mac seemed paralyzed in a circular position, his arms now stretched out over his head nearly touching his flukes. His eyes snapped open, and then his entire body shimmered and disappeared.\n\u0026ldquo;What the hell!?\u0026rdquo; snapped Brent as he stood quickly and rushed over to the tank. \u0026ldquo;Where did he go?\u0026rdquo;\nJoy appeared to be confused as well, and Brent rapped on the glass, which startled all the fish in the tank.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t do that,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said, joining him at the tank.\nJoy looked at the worried expressions of everyone outside the tank, and then back at Mac, who had relaxed in the water. She shook her head and realized that she was sensing Mac with her proto-mer senses and not really seeing him at all. In fact, when she blinked her eyes, she realized that she could barely see him at all. Only his eyes, which were facing her, were the only features clearly visible to her.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s happening, Mac?\u0026rdquo; she asked, bubbles rising from her mouth.\nMac felt the grip of the final paralysis of his transformation ebb from his body. He had been conscious the entire time, over twenty-six hours, but he had been unable to move or communicate with Joy. More importantly, he hadn\u0026rsquo;t been able to focus on his own change; he had been a helpless passenger as the siren cells and parasites reshaped his body. There was something deeply disturbing about his helplessness, but his long military training had kicked in, and he focused simply on feeling his heartbeat, and the sensations of his gills fluttering in the water. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite like breathing, but there were enough similarities that it allowed him to remain sane.\nThere had been some pain as his bones reshaped, and the feelings of compression along his ankles and feet were still a vivid memory. He wished he had been able to look down, but his body was caught in a seizure from which he couldn\u0026rsquo;t break free. Now, his body was overwhelming him with new sensations and feelings. He could sense energy around him, which he supposed were his now fully functional mer-organs sending his brain information. He could feel the pressure of the water over his tail, along his fins and flukes. His fins and flukes felt different from his legs, and the sensation of \u0026ldquo;legs\u0026rdquo; had totally disappeared.\n\u0026ldquo;Mac, can you hear me?\u0026rdquo; he heard Joy ask him.\nHe turned his attention outward and looked out at the humans standing outside the tank, and then at his lover floating nearby, and then down at his tail. His brow furrowed, as he realized that while he could \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; his tail, that his tail was doing something rather extraordinary. He raised a hand before his face, and he waved it back and forth. He flipped it back and forth, palm out, palm in, several times. He watched as the latent image of whatever was behind him melted into what was in front of him along the surface of his skin. He tried it with his other hand, and then he tried to stop it from happening. Nothing changed. His own brain, he noticed, was filtering out the camouflage, and he could clearly see his own flesh. But he could also see that his skin had become like a television screen, and he felt slight sensations of movement along his skin as the images his skin was producing shifted and changed.\n\u0026ldquo;Mac?\u0026rdquo; Joy repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, bubbles incongruously appearing out of a mouth that suddenly appeared below his eyes. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m hungry, but I feel fine. This is cool.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why are you invisible?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, her voice tinged with awe.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not,\u0026rdquo; answered Mac. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m camouflaged. My skin is reflecting or reproducing or something \u0026hellip; whatever is on the other side of me, like a television screen, but I\u0026rsquo;m not doing this consciously.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s like the cuttlefish,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;The parasites must have done something, changing you in this way. I tried to focus on you, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s O.K.; it\u0026rsquo;s not your fault,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;I feel fine, really. But I can\u0026rsquo;t seem to turn it off. Can you see me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can still see you,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m being helped by my proto-mersenses, I think. Let\u0026rsquo;s check in with them,\u0026rdquo; she finished with a kick towards the surface.\nMac puzzled for a moment, wondering what he needed to \u0026ldquo;do,\u0026rdquo; and so he stretched his \u0026ldquo;toes\u0026rdquo; and watched as his flukes stiffened and spread. He \u0026ldquo;bent\u0026rdquo; his knees, and felt a very different reaction in his tail. He rolled his torso and hips into what he hoped was a stroke of his tail and unexpectedly discovered the full power of his new tail. He rose up too quickly and breached, his hips and pelvic fins rising into the air. When he broke the surface of the water, he could feel the air hit his skin like a slap across the face. He winced, and felt his face and the rest of his body react to the air. It felt like a layer of skin ripped up from his entire body, but without pain, sort of like after he had been sunburned as a child, and the tan peeled off. He fell back into the water and felt the strangeness disappear, and he sensed a commotion outside the tank. He gave a more gentle kick with his tail, and rose to the edge of the tank, now more under control. He felt the same \u0026ldquo;unsealing\u0026rdquo; sensation when his face broke the surface of the water. He also noticed that his hair did not immediately become dry, and he could feel the water drip from his face.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not hydrophobic,\u0026rdquo; he reported. \u0026ldquo;Like the other mers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We can see you!\u0026rdquo; Annette said, her eyes sweeping over the entire form of Mac as he hung from the side of the tank. \u0026ldquo;When you broke the surface of the water, your entire body flashed into view.\u0026rdquo;\nMac nodded and let go of the tank wall and sank again, immediately disappearing as soon as he was completely submerged. He surveyed his now photosensitive skin and marveled at how his body was refracting and polarizing the light from surfaces near him. He rose back to the surface, and it shut off dramatically.\n\u0026ldquo;Your skin cells are now chromatophores,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said. \u0026ldquo;You must have picked it up from the cuttlefish!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Infected, more likely,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said.\n\u0026ldquo;Chromotaphores?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Cells that can manipulate light,\u0026rdquo; Jackson explained. \u0026ldquo;Some mammals have them, but they don\u0026rsquo;t normally possess advanced chromatophores. Cephalopods and reptiles do. Those siren cells must be incredibly powerful to create that strong of a transgenic effect.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why do you think air affects it?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked looking at Mac\u0026rsquo;s otherwise normal looking skin in the air. \u0026ldquo;He doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like a reptile.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or a cuttlefish, thank goodness,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, grinning.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d have to guess,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said. \u0026ldquo;This whole thing is a bit out of my league.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then guess,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, looking down at him.\n\u0026ldquo;Normally metachrosis,\u0026rdquo; he began, stopping himself as he saw the arched eyebrows and cocked heads. \u0026ldquo;Um, the chromatic camouflage you\u0026rsquo;re apparently doing\u0026ndash;metachrosis\u0026ndash;bending the light to disguise yourself, is normally either a physiological mechanism, like in cuttlefish or octopus, they use a muscle to trigger the camouflage, or a chemical or hormonal one, like a chameleon, which is why they change so slowly. Muscles are quicker.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m not moving any muscles,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;At least none that I know about.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You might discover them later, but if yours turns out to be involuntary, like the chameleon, but fast, like the cuttlefish, then my best guess is that the camouflage is triggered electrochemically, facilitated by the slight conductivity of seawater,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said.\n\u0026ldquo;So, simply being in seawater makes me metachrosize?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that\u0026rsquo;s a proper form of that word,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said. \u0026ldquo;But sure, that seems to be as good an explanation as possible without further experimentation.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No one is experimenting on me today,\u0026rdquo; Mac said.\n\u0026ldquo;I like your guess,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;From what I remember in my lessons in Mer anatomy, we have organs that generate considerable bio-electric energy, some of which could certainly be harnessed to make chromatophores bend light. Because Mac\u0026rsquo;s skin doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be hydrophobic, like the other mers, an electro-chemical switch for metachrosis could help explain why.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why the brown skin?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Neutral color state for the chromatophores,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said with a nod towards the back of the tank. \u0026ldquo;Just like the cuttlefish.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Makes sense,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, feeling his own fingers as he rubbed them together. \u0026ldquo;I feel different, but not too different.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can I touch you?\u0026rdquo; Kyle asked, speaking for the first time.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; Mac answered. \u0026ldquo;Grab that ladder over there and grab a feel.\u0026rdquo;\nKyle retrieved the stepladder from the corner and opened it up next to the glass wall where Mac was perched. He carefully ascended the ladder and tentatively put a hand on Mac\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. He ran his fingers along the shoulder down to where the water lapped at Mac\u0026rsquo;s upper forearm.\n\u0026ldquo;Feels more human to me,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said. \u0026ldquo;Not like a fish.\u0026rdquo;\nMac rubbed his own hand along the same skin, feeling both the relative smoothness, given how youthful he had become, and the \u0026ldquo;normalcy\u0026rdquo; of what he supposed or remembered was human skin.\n\u0026ldquo;Yep,\u0026rdquo; said Mac in the same laconic tones. \u0026ldquo;It feels human to me too, though perhaps a bit like a dolphin.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yup,\u0026rdquo; agreed Kyle. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d agree with that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are those scales on your tail?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked, pointing as she looked. \u0026ldquo;There are several different textures, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the depth and layers like scales.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The mers didn\u0026rsquo;t have scales, per se,\u0026rdquo; Joy explained, glancing down at Mac\u0026rsquo;s tail as he curled it up between them. \u0026ldquo;But the coloring and patterns of their skin look scale-like from their waist down.\n\u0026ldquo;It does feel different,\u0026rdquo; Mac said as he reached down and ran his hands along his waist. \u0026ldquo;A slight difference in texture between my torso and my tail,\u0026rdquo; he noted.\n\u0026ldquo;Mer skin is more like dolphin skin than fish scales, but the tail has a different texture. But since mer skin is normally hydrophobic, we\u0026rsquo;re obviously going to be a different variety of mer. This will probably mean that we can\u0026rsquo;t swim as fast as the other mers,\u0026rdquo; Joy concluded.\n\u0026ldquo;We won\u0026rsquo;t have to,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;No one will be able to see us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the ocean,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;There will always be some predator that can see or sense you, sharks will detect your presence.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can handle a shark,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s humans that have me worried.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I guess you\u0026rsquo;re not human any more, eh?\u0026rdquo; Joy said.\n\u0026ldquo;I guess not,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;But as long as you think I\u0026rsquo;m handsome, I don\u0026rsquo;t care what I am.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re amazing,\u0026rdquo; Joy said as she kissed him. \u0026ldquo;Are you sure that everything else feels alright?\u0026rdquo;\nMac made to steal another kiss from Joy, but she waved him away and pointed to the rest of the tank. Mac reluctantly let go of the side of the tank and slid back into the water, disappearing before the human eyes. He stretched forward, backward, and side to side, and felt for the first time, his flukes and fins, running his hands along the fringes that trailed from those appendages. He gave a quick swim around the tank, and the humans could see where he was as the other fish reacted to his displacement of water as he swam by. He popped back into view next to Joy as he surfaced.\n\u0026ldquo;I feel great, and the fish can\u0026rsquo;t see me either,\u0026rdquo; Mac said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;This will make hunting easier. Speaking of which, I\u0026rsquo;m hungry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe how fast the metachrosis happens,\u0026rdquo; Jack said, his voice tinged with amazement. \u0026ldquo;Normally it takes a second or two to change each look, but when you swam around the tank, it was nearly instantaneous. It really was like you were invisible!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I could tell that the fish couldn\u0026rsquo;t see me,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;It was really weird, because I was actually trying to startle them, but some of them only reacted when they accidentally brushed up against me. I almost reached out and ate one, because I\u0026rsquo;m so hungry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then,\u0026rdquo; Joy said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;As long as you don\u0026rsquo;t feel any other ill effects, I think I can live with being brown in the air and invisible in the water. In fact, I can\u0026rsquo;t think of anything more perfect for a bunch of former spies,\u0026rdquo; she nodded at Brent and Annette.\n\u0026ldquo;There is a certain karmic justice here,\u0026rdquo; Annette agreed. \u0026ldquo;Are you sure that you feel alright?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What would we do if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked. \u0026ldquo;Would we leave him the only camo-mer in existence?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not what I meant,\u0026rdquo; Annette protested.\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m surprised by this development, but I\u0026rsquo;m no longer human, brown or not. I\u0026rsquo;d rather not be the only one who is like this for very long. However, I don\u0026rsquo;t want anyone else to join me without fully understanding what he or she is in for. Let\u0026rsquo;s just wait a day before we do you,\u0026rdquo; he said nodding at Joy.\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; she protested. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t stand being cooped up here another second!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But you could be trapped in something worse after you change,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;After I eat, let\u0026rsquo;s just run some tests, like hoisting me out of the water to see if the burning still happens. I don\u0026rsquo;t want you or Annette or Brent to be trapped into an existence we didn\u0026rsquo;t otherwise promise.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not waiting twenty-four hours, Mac,\u0026rdquo; said Joy with a tone that Mac remembered.\n\u0026ldquo;At least wait until we know if I can tolerate being in the air for any length of time,\u0026rdquo; Mac said.\n\u0026ldquo;It won\u0026rsquo;t matter to me what our circumstance will be,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m joining you today. Period.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Deal,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;Just get me some food, a few tests, and then you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re going to change too,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;It won\u0026rsquo;t matter to us either. One way or the other, we\u0026rsquo;re not going back to our old lives. A new life, with new capabilities, and the possibility of creating new life \u0026hellip; that\u0026rsquo;s all that matters.\u0026rdquo; Brent gave her a nod, and they both looked coolly back at Mac and Joy.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;m so glad my logic and reasoning made such a big difference,\u0026rdquo; Mac said.\n\u0026ldquo;So, do you want change?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, deflecting attention towards Kyle.\n\u0026ldquo;Me?\u0026rdquo; Kyle asked. \u0026ldquo;You asking me if I want to be a mer?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Provided that this particular species of mer isn\u0026rsquo;t too unattractive,\u0026rdquo; she continued, jerking her thumb at Mac.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, he looks alright,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said.\n\u0026ldquo;He looks a bit hungry,\u0026rdquo; Mac said grumpily.\n\u0026ldquo;Did Jackson explain to you what becoming a mer might mean?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yup,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said. \u0026ldquo;But we\u0026rsquo;re two men.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So are we,\u0026rdquo; Brent said, with a shrug for Annette. \u0026ldquo;Well, we WERE two men. He\u0026rsquo;s now a merman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a hungry merman,\u0026rdquo; Mac said with a tinge of anger in his voice.\n\u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;re not going to be a merman?\u0026rdquo; asked Kyle, looking down at Brent.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the plan,\u0026rdquo; Brent said.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;ll be a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, possessively putting her arm around her husband. \u0026ldquo;Like me, and we\u0026rsquo;ll still be mates.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And mates with me too,\u0026rdquo; Joy said.\nKyle looked from Mac, to Joy, to Annette, to Brent, to Jack. He shuddered. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think such an arrangement could work for Jack and I,\u0026rdquo; he said, stepping down from the ladder.\n\u0026ldquo;Then you need to scare up six women who you could trust to join you,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;Three each. Maybe one of those women you find could get me some food since no one here cares to help a guy out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Couldn\u0026rsquo;t we stay?\u0026rdquo; Jackson asked. \u0026ldquo;I mean, this has been our home and such for a long time. We could start our own colony.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In one of the busiest waterways in the world?\u0026rdquo; challenged Mac. \u0026ldquo;And so close to Washington, DC? In less than a week you\u0026rsquo;d be an experiment at Bethesda Naval or someplace Langley keeps secret even from me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, there\u0026rsquo;s that, I suppose,\u0026rdquo; Jackson nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d think we\u0026rsquo;d need to leave,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said. \u0026ldquo;If we changed, too much trouble to be had hanging around, people thinking how crazy Jack Baker turned himself into one of his own creatures and such. Besides, no cuttlefish in the Chesapeake.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can I eat the cuttlefish?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, well,\u0026rdquo; Jackson started. \u0026ldquo;Say, Kyle \u0026hellip; what do you think of my cousin Annie?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s right enough,\u0026rdquo; Kyle answered. \u0026ldquo;I was thinking we\u0026rsquo;d see about my niece Angela. She loves the sea and the environment, and such. Her father\u0026rsquo;s a bit of an asshole, and so she might be happy about changing things up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sure enough,\u0026rdquo; Jackson agreed. \u0026ldquo;But that still leaves four more.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Couldn\u0026rsquo;t we do with just two?\u0026rdquo; Kyle asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Mermen become uncontrollably competitive if there isn\u0026rsquo;t at least one of their own mates present,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, putting a hand on Mac\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. \u0026ldquo;If you had only one, and something happened \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;And that would be a problem?\u0026rdquo; Kyle asked.\n\u0026ldquo;A big problem,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;I can feel it now, with three of you in the room. It\u0026rsquo;s just a little twinge, but there\u0026rsquo;s something about all you unmated men that makes my heart race. Almost as much as my hunger makes me grumpy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll need to find some volunteers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We should recruit skills and expertise,\u0026rdquo; Jack said, looking at Brent, Annette and Joy. \u0026ldquo;People who can help the mer society grow.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now, you\u0026rsquo;re talking!\u0026rdquo; Annette said.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m talking here!\u0026rdquo; Mac thundered, startling everyone. \u0026ldquo;Good God! What does a merman have to do around here to get some food?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right, sorry,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said and headed back into the storage room.\n\u0026ldquo;How about you,\u0026rdquo; Mac asked Joy. \u0026ldquo;Hungry?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I could do with a bit of food,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m hungrier for the change.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Soon enough,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;Food first, a few quick tests, and then you change.\u0026rdquo;\n[Everything is set, all systems secure?] Pat asked, the pods arranged behind her, boosting her CHEW.\n[Yep!] Rose answered, her CHEW stronger over distances than any other mer, probably because she had invented and made all the tiaras that made CHEW communication possible. [The Device is set, secure, and probably won\u0026rsquo;t ever open now.]\n[So, making love at 1000 meters is something special?] Pat asked.\n[I guess you could say that,] Rose said.\n[How soon can we expect you back?] Pat asked.\n[We\u0026rsquo;re going to start the mapping and reconnaissance work today, so we ought to be back in about a week,] Rose answered. [We\u0026rsquo;re going to explore and have some fun.]\n[Your moms were worried about you and wanted to know how you\u0026rsquo;re doing,] Pat said.\n[When everyone is boosting CHEW, everyone can hear the conversation, right?] Rose asked.\n[Yes,] Pat said, hearing something playful in Rose\u0026rsquo;s CHEW. [What\u0026rsquo;s up, you have something to tell us, girl?]\n[Oh, nothing,] Rose said. [We\u0026rsquo;ll check in tomorrow morning, as ordered, kay?]\n[Alright, you scamp,] Pat said. [You\u0026rsquo;ll tell us the news upon your return, right?]\n[What news?] Rose demanded. [How do you know these things? God, we\u0026rsquo;re hundreds of miles away, but it was like you were watching or something.]\n[When you become a parent, you see and hear things from children differently,] Pat said.\n[Well, I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll find out shortly then, won\u0026rsquo;t I?] Rose said. [Talk to you tomorrow!] Her signal faded.\nThere was a brief pause as the mers gathered in formation along the northeastern edge of the island\u0026rsquo;s shelf processed the conversation. Pat shook her head as she recovered from the strain of long distance CHEW. Behind her, she heard Janice, Jaclyn, and Julie start squealing with joy.\nJoy watched Mac with her still developing mer-senses as he swam around the tank, his long body undulating gracefully as he sped past the fish who were clearly confused about what was disturbing their water. She admired the power visible in his tail, even as it was flashing the colors and textures of whatever he was passing before, her mer-senses able to help her see the rippling muscles as they worked beneath his skin. She remembered the first time she saw the mers. God, there had only been a few of them back then. Now, it seemed like mers were popping out the seafloor.\nMac passed by her closely, where she floated a few feet below the surface, keeping her still sensitive skin out of the air. Now that Mac had fully transformed, he could tolerate the air just fine. He had just spent the last two hours outside the tank, doing exercises and testing the limits of his physicality on dry land. He proved as graceful and powerful on dry land as he had in the water, and other than the relatively plain and uniform mocha coloring he now possessed, he seemed much like the mers back on Mermaid Island.\nJoy remember how beautiful she thought little Sally-su-su had become as a mermaid. Well, she had been a beautiful little girl, why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t she make a beautiful mermaid. And Eric, he seemed a worthy mate for her little Sally. She remembered Eric\u0026rsquo;s royal blue tail and how beautiful all the mers looked with their many colors. She felt a twinge of regret that she now seemed doomed to be plain brown most of the time. On the other hand, she would be thousands of colors in the water, and perhaps they would learn to control this new feature like the cuttlefish did. She hoped so. Having grown up a plain Jane, brown eyed, brown haired girl, she had been looking forward to the dramatic beauty she thought she might become when she became a mer.\n\u0026ldquo;You ready?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked as came up next to her, finished with his testing of his body and reflexes.\n\u0026ldquo;Born ready,\u0026rdquo; Joy replied.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s my line,\u0026rdquo; Mac joked. He rose up, his metachrosis snapping off as the air hit his fingers as they grabbed the edge of the tank. \u0026ldquo;You guys ready?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yup,\u0026rdquo; Kyle answered from behind a camera. \u0026ldquo;Ready for posterity!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It still freaks me out when you do that,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;Bamn! you\u0026rsquo;re visible. Poof, you\u0026rsquo;re not.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When you transition, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see him all the time,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, her face appearing next to his. \u0026ldquo;Mer-senses are the best.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You haven\u0026rsquo;t seen anything yet,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;When your mer-senses are fully functional you\u0026rsquo;ll see; it\u0026rsquo;s amazing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then let\u0026rsquo;s do it,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, letting herself sink beneath the surface of the tank.\nMac let himself sink as well, taking a moment to marvel, again, at how beautiful Joy was now that she\u0026rsquo;d filled back out after the parasites nearly killed her. They kissed, Joy pressing the full length of her body into his, her toes only reaching halfway down his much longer tail. Mac tugged on his new vent muscle, releasing his newly enlarged penis, and Joy backed away, watching it emerge.\nIt felt strange to him, telescoping out from his body, feeling the stiffness both extend down into his tail and outward through his penis. Joy sank down some more, her long brown hair floating upwards like a lion\u0026rsquo;s mane. She looked Mac in the eye as she slid her lips over the end of his enormous penis. Mac focused his mind on the transformation, on same coloring and configuration he had. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if the same seizure would overwhelm either him or Joy, but all the other mers had been able to affect their final coloring, and he wanted his new pod mate to truly be his mate, his match.\n\u0026ldquo;Make me your mermaid,\u0026rdquo; she said, looking up at him.\nJoy put her mouth back over his penis and stroked him hard with her hands, willing Mac to give her the siren cells she needed for her transformation. She swirled her tongue around the fat tip, and then sucked hard again. Mac\u0026rsquo;s eyes rolled back in his head, the speed, and force of his arousal surprising him. He felt a gathering of energy deep in his tail, and then it rose up violently, shooting into Joy\u0026rsquo;s mouth. Joy, expecting a somewhat normal orgasm felt overwhelmed by the volume that flooded her mouth.\nShe maintained her grip and her composure, and swallowed it down. It tasted much the same as she remembered, slightly salty, musky, not exactly tasty, but not horrific. Mac was moaning in pleasure as she felt her mouth fill again as Mac shuddered through another mighty pulse and the energy in her own body began to build. Another pulse, nearly as strong and as filling as the first two filled her mouth again, and she felt a tingle arise in her legs. Another pulse, this one weaker and smaller, but now her body began to move on its own, her legs beginning to stiffen. A final pulse and Mac\u0026rsquo;s moans turned into a tone, a hum.\nJoy felt her arms draw away from Mac\u0026rsquo;s penis of their own accord, and she saw Mac\u0026rsquo;s body sink to be even with her own. She could feel energies forming throughout her body as the siren cells and parasites gathered energy for her final transformation. She saw Mac reach out and touch her waist, and the two of them began spinning gently, the other fish in the tank repeating their earlier behavior. She tried to move or blink, and found she could not. She hoped that her face wasn\u0026rsquo;t frozen in a grimace, and felt her legs tighten even further, her toes pointed straight down at the bottom of the tank. She held Mac\u0026rsquo;s gaze, or rather, she realized that he was holding hers, and she focused on his eyes and the sound of his humming.\nMac could feel the urge to hum while the white-hot orgasm still ripped through his body. A mer orgasm was a thousand times more powerful than a human one, he decided. He sank down and put a hand on her waist, feeling the dramatic indent between her waist and wide hips. He focused on her Nj eyes let himself be guided by the powerful forces now surrounding both of them, humming a deep tone that felt natural and right. He noticed the bubbles begin to rise, and soon a wall of bubbles surrounded him and Joy.\nOutside the tank, Annette, Brent, Jack, and Kyle watched as the powerful forces overtook the two figures in the water. The bubbles were thicker and more forceful than when Mac had changed. The bubbles actually made it easier to keep track of Mac, as they shimmered around the edges of his otherwise invisible body. They could see Joy more easily despite the thicker bubbles, and her transformation seemed to be happening much more quickly. Within a few hours they could already see her tail forming, and within a mere twelve hours, she was gripped with the final spasms of transformation, looking very much like Mac. None of the four humans left the room, seemingly compelled to witness her entire transformation. As Joy released herself from the arched pose, she too snapped out of view, her skin bending light to hide her.\nAs the bubbles dissipated, the four humans outside the tank could no longer really see the two camouflaged mers. They waited for a few minutes, hoping they would surface.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s going on?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Transformation copulation,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;When a new mer is created there is an overwhelming urge to mate, and it affects all the other mers within CHEW distance.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What nonsense are you talking here?\u0026rdquo; Kyle asked. \u0026ldquo;What the heck is a chew distance?\u0026rdquo;\nInside the tank, while Annette brought Kyle up to speed on mer behaviors, Mac and Joy underwent the instinctual forces to mate after transformation. They were stroking each other madly, running their mutually photosensitive limbs and tails along each others' tail, enjoying the frenetic build of their sexual union. When Mac finally pushed into her, it surprised neither of them of the wild gyrations of energies playing along their bodies. The ignition of their internal bioluminescence combined with the light bouncing and bending around on their skin made each of them look like a mer-shaped package of fireworks.\n\u0026ldquo;Look!\u0026rdquo; Annette said, pointing to the center of the tank.\nAs the amazed humans watched, they could see two mers clearly in the act of copulating, their bodies flashing with light and energy. They appeared to the humans as mer-shaped bottles of light, colors and patterns and flashes of all kinds zipping across their skins as they stroked back and forth together. Joy\u0026rsquo;s arms were around Mac\u0026rsquo;s neck, Mac having a firm hold on Joy\u0026rsquo;s hips, and their pelvic fins slapping together with each long stroke. All four of them felt their own lust rise, but no one moved, mesmerized by the beauty and passion they could see in the tank.\n\u0026ldquo;This \u0026hellip; is \u0026hellip; amazing,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, feeling a throbbing core of pleasure beginning to rise up from her newly positioned womb.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, tightening his grip on her hips, and stroking even faster. In moments, both clutched each other as a massive mutual orgasm rocked their bodies.\nOutside the tank, Annette grabbed Brent\u0026rsquo;s hand and dragged him from the room.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t care how old you are,\u0026rdquo; she said. Brent threw a smirking grin back to Jack and Kyle as he was dragged, quite willingly, from the room.\nKyle gave Jack a long look.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t even think it,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\nIf a buyer had walked into the port cabin, looking to buy The Johanna, he or she would have been impressed with how neatly the room had been dismantled. Normally, when someone trashes a room, they tend to throw things around, discard useless pictures, wall coverings, plastic molding, or bits of carpet. The two occupants had carefully picked apart the entire stateroom, without any tools, and still hadn\u0026rsquo;t found a way to make a weapon worth talking about or finding a way out of the room without alerting their captors. One reason why the room was so neat was that neither man possessed the physical ability to break anything, so each item they had pried loose or broken away from the wall had been done with leverage and patience, rather than brute strength.\nMalaki lay on the bed while his son lay on the floor. They had spent the better part of a day trying to make a rope out of the bedsheets, and when Peter had come into the room to give them dinner, he had effortlessly taken it from them. The loss of all that work and effort, and the fact that the bed now lacked sheets, had made all their efforts seem completely pointless. Malaki fumed at the helplessness that had overtaken him. He cursed the weakness of his own body, and he cursed the weak creature that his son had turned out to be.\n\u0026ldquo;Tomorrow we try the carpet,\u0026rdquo; he said with a sigh.\n\u0026ldquo;Tomorrow you can go fuck yourself,\u0026rdquo; his son said back.\nThree days ago, he would have backhanded the youth for such talk. Two weeks ago, he would have sent one of a dozen men to go beat the shit out of the impudent son of a bitch. But today he couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring himself to do more than retort, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s these creatures that will fuck you, not me.\u0026rdquo;\nTorro didn\u0026rsquo;t argue, but he rolled towards the wall, gathering the pillow his father had tossed from the bed under his head, and closed his eyes hoping everything would go away, or be different, or just stop.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t turn your back to me!\u0026rdquo; Malaki said. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t let them do this to your own father!\u0026rdquo;\nI wish that I was the one doing this to you! Torro thought to himself, but he only said, \u0026ldquo;Leave me alone!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you want to die?\u0026rdquo; Malaki asked. \u0026ldquo;Is that what you want?\u0026rdquo;? \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t care,\u0026rdquo; Torro said, and he meant it. \u0026ldquo;There are worse things than death.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There is nothing worse than dying,\u0026rdquo; Malaki argued, trying to rouse his son to some level of action.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Torro agreed. \u0026ldquo;Living without honor is worse than dying.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Putanginamo!\u0026rdquo; Malaki said to his son. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t know what honor is.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck you, too! You killed my mother,\u0026rdquo; Torro said. \u0026ldquo;You have no honor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t kill your mother, your brother\u0026rsquo;s killed her,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said. \u0026ldquo;You were there!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She was trying to protect me from bullies at school,\u0026rdquo; Torro said. \u0026ldquo;The headmaster wasn\u0026rsquo;t her lover! He raped her when she tried to get him to do his job! No one listened to me, I was only ten. No one ever listens to me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Your mother dishonored me and our family,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said. \u0026ldquo;She deserved to die.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You practically ordered Manalo to kill her, and then you wanted to protect your murderous sons,\u0026rdquo; Torro said. \u0026ldquo;You are the one who has dishonored the family.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You worm, you shit! How dare you question my honor! I will kill you!\u0026rdquo; Malaki sputtered, trying to raise himself from the bed.\n\u0026ldquo;Just like you killed her?\u0026rdquo; Torro said. \u0026ldquo;Well, go ahead. I don\u0026rsquo;t care.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Living like a worm is worse than no honor,\u0026rdquo; Malaki said. \u0026ldquo;You have become a worm.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have always been a worm!\u0026rdquo; Torro said.\n\u0026ldquo;I am not and never will be a worm!\u0026rdquo; Malaki said. \u0026ldquo;I am a man, and I will always be a man. I will live like a man and die like a man.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good for you,\u0026rdquo; Torro said.\nMalaki wanted to keep yelling at his son, force him to come up with some plans to fight or escape or something, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t raise his head from the bed. How could this worm be his son? There had to be some drug or something that they were putting in their food that was doing this to them, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t smell or taste anything unusual. He had tried not eating anything for a day, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to work. Maybe they were putting something in the water, but if they were, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t see it or taste it.\nWell, today confirmed a growing suspicion; his youngest son detested him. Malaki now knew that Torro hated nearly everything about him, and that he blamed Malaki for his mother\u0026rsquo;s death. Malaki let that thought hit the center of his being. His own son was now an equal enemy to him as his captors. As he fumed about his son, he heard someone fiddle with the door, unlocking it from the outside. A moment later, the door opened.\n\u0026ldquo;Hungry boss?\u0026rdquo; a somber Sudhish asked as he entered with two bowls and to water bottles.\nMalaki wanted to sit up, leap off the bed, and beat the crap out of his former assistant, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t seem to gather enough strength to sit up, let alone leap from the bed. Sudhish ignored him, putting the two bowls and two water bottles on the one bedside table that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been dismantled.\n\u0026ldquo;These will wait until you\u0026rsquo;re hungry enough to eat,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said.\n\u0026ldquo;You happy now,\u0026rdquo; Malaki spat. \u0026ldquo;Are you happy now that you\u0026rsquo;re free and I\u0026rsquo;m helpless?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll never be free of you,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said, his face full of sorrow. \u0026ldquo;Your men killed my sister, and I helped you do it. I didn\u0026rsquo;t stop you. I\u0026rsquo;ll never be free of this burden.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And so you gloat over me now?\u0026rdquo; Malaki said, wishing his limbs would fill with adrenaline so that he could grab the small Indian man, use him to force his own release from this hell. As it was, it took the entire sentence for Malaki to sit up, and even then, he felt weak in the wake of the effort.\n\u0026ldquo;Gloat?\u0026rdquo; Sudhish challenged. \u0026ldquo;That would require me to care what you thought in the first place,\u0026rdquo; he spat back at his former boss, turning on his heal, and locking the door after he left.\nMalaki let himself fall back into the bed. He knew that soon his hunger and thirst would drive him to eat. He was sure that the food or the water was drugged, because he always seemed to get enough energy to eat. It was the same pattern; eat, feel weaker, grow stronger, grow hungry and thirsty, eat, and so on. These people were good, too. They were only giving him and his son enough to survive, thus keeping them perpetually thirsty and hungry, so they were always needing food or water, and thus staying weakened by the drugs they had obviously mixed into the food or water or both. Damn them!\nHe reviewed, again, the past three days, the past three hellish days. First, those sea creatures had stabbed him with some sort of weapon and paralyzed him and all his bodyguards, Anjo\u0026rsquo;s as well. How stupid he had been! So little research into what was happening. So focused was he on finding and punishing his sons that he had completely misread the situation in Davao. Then, he had been thrown onto this boat, where he had slowly pieced together information to surmise that he was the accidental prize to a rescue mission focused on the girls and not his own capture. He knew that he and his son were heading for somewhere called Mermaid Island, and that something would happen there. He was pretty sure that whatever was going to happen there, he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like it.\nHe struggled to sit back up. He knew he needed to get his son\u0026rsquo;s food over to that side of the bed so that Torro, his now confirmed enemy, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to get near him. It took him five minutes, but he managed to get the bowl of fish stew, it appeared to be, and the small bottle of water, to the far side of the bed. He lay back down and waited for enough strength to return so that he could satisfy his own now raging thirst and hunger. He cursed the need that drew him to eat and drink, and cursed the food and drink that caused him to curse.\nHe had never felt such despair or helplessness in his life.\n\u0026ldquo;I, ah, didn\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;d find you out here,\u0026rdquo; Jack said as he sat down on the dock next to Brent.\n\u0026ldquo;Annette said she had to share some girl talk with Pat on the radio,\u0026rdquo; Brent said, running his hands through his brown hair that was streaked with gray. \u0026ldquo;I figured she needed some privacy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Those two in the tank don\u0026rsquo;t seem to need much privacy,\u0026rdquo; Jack said, looking out at the bay, watching a single sailboat tack against the wind off to their west. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. Both good looking kids, too. Of course, if I looked that good, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t care who walked in on me in the middle of \u0026hellip; you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Those two in the tank are both older than I am,\u0026rdquo; Brent said.\n\u0026ldquo;Right, keep forgetting,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;But you too, eh? Younger soon enough?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I guess,\u0026rdquo; said Brent, his voice tight with emotion.\n\u0026ldquo;No?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked. \u0026ldquo;Not a mermaid, then?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, Jack, my old friend,\u0026rdquo; Brent said, slapping Jack on the back, \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t use many words, but you\u0026rsquo;re always direct.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yup,\u0026rdquo; Jack nodded. He waited for a few moments, both of them sitting in silence.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not gonna laugh at me, are ya?\u0026rdquo; Brent asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Nope,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. A few more moments passed as the sunlight dappled on the dark, gray water. The sails on the distant sailboat snapped and cracked as the boat turned and made another tack against the wind.\n\u0026ldquo;Annette made it clear to me that she was going to be a mermaid no matter what,\u0026rdquo; Brent began. He stuffed his nervous hands into the pockets of the light jacket he had thrown on to go outside. \u0026ldquo;And that she wanted to be with her old friends, together. Joy, Mac, and me, and there was only one way to do that, and, well, it just seemed like everyone expected that I would be the third mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nobody asked you?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Not really,\u0026rdquo; Brent answered. \u0026ldquo;Not in any real way. I suppose they didn\u0026rsquo;t have to.\u0026rdquo; He paused.\n\u0026ldquo;Why not?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to sound ungrateful for your help and friendship over the years, but what has this got to do with you?\u0026rdquo; Brent challenged.\n\u0026ldquo;You already lost five bucks,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;You want to lose more?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yea,\u0026rdquo; Brent said, mollified. \u0026ldquo;You might have to make the same choice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not the same one,\u0026rdquo; Jack argued. \u0026ldquo;But a similar one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. They both sat in silence again for a few moments.\n\u0026ldquo;So, why didn\u0026rsquo;t they have to ask you?\u0026rdquo; Jack repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Haven\u0026rsquo;t you ever wondered about it yourself?\u0026rdquo; Brent asked.\n\u0026ldquo;About becoming a mermaid?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked. \u0026ldquo;No, not ever.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;What about having tits?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah,\u0026rdquo; Jack said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t every 13 year old boy? Of course, I didn\u0026rsquo;t think about wearing tits, just having \u0026lsquo;em close by.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean you never thought about what it would feel like to actually have tits?\u0026rdquo; Brent asked, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;Nope,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;Honest.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Huh,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;I guess I must be weird.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nah,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m the wierdo, trust me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;I still wonder \u0026hellip; you know \u0026hellip; what it would be like.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. They sat in silence again. \u0026ldquo;Did you ever pretend?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, yes,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;But only once, and I was like twelve or something. But it sticks with you, you know, the memory and the curiosity.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;What did you do?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;God,\u0026rdquo; Brent sighed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a former Navy man! You trying to embarrass me or something?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nah,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just curious. Seriously.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter a moment of silence, he said \u0026ldquo;I borrowed my older sister\u0026rsquo;s bra. I stuffed it with athletic socks and then put on my own tee shirt and just, you know, walked around. It was sort of weird, but sort of exciting.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;It do much for you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not really,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;I was just experimenting. Being with a real girl with real tits makes all the difference. Those were much more exciting than those socks and a tee shirt. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to first base with anyone until I was sixteen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;Me too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And the rest, you know?\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;Not just tits, I mean, the whole package\u0026ndash;top to bottom. Because women sure look like they\u0026rsquo;re having fun, you know, when they have those big, long, orgasms.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I suppose,\u0026rdquo; Jack agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;And more than one,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;That would be interesting; to have more than one orgasm at a time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And that\u0026rsquo;s interesting enough to become a girl?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked.\n\u0026ldquo;A mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Brent said. \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I think so. But it still scares the crap out of me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yup,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;I can see that.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter Rose had spilled the beans via CHEW about her pregnancy, Ann and Kate had giggled for nearly an hour, knowing that their moms were going crazy for more information and teasing Rose for being so clever. Rose made it clear that it was an accident, but she secretly enjoyed the torture both Janice and Jaclyn were undergoing as well. In the next twenty-four hours, Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pod had surveyed two new atolls, one of which had a natural spring. They had found and marked a dozen or more shipwrecks, mostly from World War II. Rose had taught both Ann and Kate how to \u0026lsquo;paint\u0026rsquo; using the polymerization technique, but everyone agreed that Rose was the only artist among them. Ann and Kate proved able to make polymerized sculptures, however, and could even make mer-bands, and with testing, they found that the ones they made were just as effective as the one\u0026rsquo;s Rose had fashioned.\nNearly twenty-four hours after their conversation with Pat they discovered a field of debris floating in the ocean. The wreckage looked so fresh that they decided to investigate. The seafloor was far, far below them, but there was evidence of what looked like a plane crash floating over a wide area. After an hour or so of searching, Rose spotted the raft. On investigating, they discovered that the raft had a small group of humans in it. They were all unconscious, severely dehydrated, and near death.\nThey towed the raft to the atoll they had just catalogued the day before, the one with the spring, and they hoped that would be enough. But after a closer examination, the mers discovered that only mermaid milk could save them. At first, they were reluctant to interfere, but Rose convinced them that life was too precious, and that while they might condemn the humans to join them as mers, they had an obligation to save them.\nThey quickly gave each of the humans the life-saving draught of mermaid milk, but the two survivors who fed from Rose had received milk from a pregnant mermaid, more powerful and concentrated than her sisters\u0026rsquo; milk. Once the humans regained consciousness, the mers spent the better part of two days helping them prepare for survival on the small atoll. Some of the humans seemed eager to accept the full gift of the siren cells. But the others were reluctant to consider being mers.\nRose found an ally in the group, and she hatched a plan for time to work its magic, rather than forcing the issue with logic or reason. The siren cells would do their work, and time would heal all wounds. The mers left without deliberately crushing the hopes of those who hoped to return to the \u0026ldquo;civilized world\u0026rdquo;, and offered a promise that they would come back to check on them in the future.\nThey continued on their mission to map and chart the area\u0026rsquo;s resources and landmarks, and then started their return trip to Mermaid Island.\n\u0026ldquo;This is Bartholomew Kolbert, how can I help you?\u0026rdquo; the Connor\u0026rsquo;s lawyer and CFO of the Marine Mammal Institute answered the phone briskly.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you Mr. Kolbert,\u0026rdquo; the reedy tenor voice responded. \u0026ldquo;My name is Jackson Baker, and I believe you have my portfolio before you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yes, Mr. Baker,\u0026rdquo; Bart answered. \u0026ldquo;The fax came through just fine. Most impressive, but I have to give you my honest professional advice, and that is I\u0026rsquo;m not likely to be much help on the east coast. I\u0026rsquo;ve been based in California my entire career. You would be far better off using a real estate lawyer based in the East to handle your transaction. I can refer you to one of my partners in Washington or northern Virginia if you like.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I understand and appreciate your professional ethics and advice,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said. \u0026ldquo;However, I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked to tell you that you should open Appendix T before we proceed further.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t understand: Appendix T?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. Hank Connor,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said into the phone. \u0026ldquo;He was your client, and he has asked me to tell you to open Appendix T.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; yes \u0026hellip; have you actually heard from Hank?\u0026rdquo; Bart asked. \u0026ldquo;I mean, I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard from him in several weeks.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have only been told to tell you to open Appendix T,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m afraid that I cannot say more until after you have unsealed those documents.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How am I to know that your request is legitimate?\u0026rdquo; Bart asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. Kolbert,\u0026rdquo; Jackson began. \u0026ldquo;If my portfolio isn\u0026rsquo;t enough, nor is the scope of my business I wish to have you supervise enough, than I hardly know what else I might say to convince you that my request is legitimate.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hank should have given you some sort of information that would help you make contact with me,\u0026rdquo; Bart suggested, trying to remain professional. \u0026ldquo;Do you have anything that might help me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Janice told me that you are the only one they could trust not to follow them to their island because you hate the water,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said.\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. Baker,\u0026rdquo; Bart said, his tone changing. \u0026ldquo;It will be my pleasure to handle your business, but you will allow me to unseal Appendix T and get up to speed on what Mr. and Mrs. Connor\u0026rsquo;s wishes actually might be.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I expected no less,\u0026rdquo; answered Jackson. \u0026ldquo;I look forward to hearing back from you shortly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I will contact you at this number as soon as I am able,\u0026rdquo; Bart said.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Kolbert,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said, hanging up the phone.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re really going to do this, aren\u0026rsquo;t you,\u0026rdquo; Annette said.\n\u0026ldquo;When have I ever gone back on my word?\u0026rdquo; Jackson challenged as he swiveled in his chair, facing his old friend.\n\u0026ldquo;Never,\u0026rdquo; she answered. \u0026ldquo;Speaking of which, I\u0026rsquo;ve got to head downstairs. You going to watch?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t miss it for the world,\u0026rdquo; Jack answered, rising.\n\u0026ldquo;What about the phone call?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;There is an extension in the viewing room,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said with some exasperation. \u0026ldquo;I entered the 21st century at the front of the pack.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;I keep forgetting that you were one of the most eminent technologists in the country. Around here, you just look like another weather beaten oysterman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yup,\u0026rdquo; Jack said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;Makes things easier if you blend in.\u0026rdquo;\nTogether they walked from the Baker house kitchen, down the basement steps, through the secret door, and down into the viewing room for the aquarium.\n\u0026ldquo;They back yet?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked Brent, who was lying on the cot.\n\u0026ldquo;The arming light for the outer locks just turned off, so they should appear in a few seconds,\u0026rdquo; he said with a nod towards the console near the seaward side of the tank.\nKyle entered from the machine room, \u0026ldquo;Everything\u0026rsquo;s fine, just like you designed it years ago. That system will last for five hundred years, even if global warming raises the sea level a full meter.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a shame to be selling it,\u0026rdquo; Jack said wistfully.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll be selling it to yourself, in a way,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;Once this island becomes part of the Marine Mammals Institute, and you being one of those marine mammals, you\u0026rsquo;ll still be here to fix the system if it needs repairs.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And putting up with getting poked and prodded and studied?\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d rather not.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll get poked and prodded by Pat and her fellow scientists on Mermaid Island if you go there, you can count on that!\u0026rdquo; Joy said as she popped into view, Mac shimmering next to her a second later.\n\u0026ldquo;Land Sakes, Woman!\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;You took a half year off my life! Don\u0026rsquo;t do that again!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry about that,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, her long body hanging from the top of the glass wall. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll wait to speak until after my camo turns off.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Make a hole,\u0026rdquo; Mac said as he dipped down into the water. The four humans all scattered from the center of the room just as Mac launched himself from the water, pulled himself into a tuck position, and gently rolled in a forward flip that he held as he rolled onto the floor below for another full rotation. He opened up into a cheesecake pose, one hand under his head, the other propped on his hip, his long tail perfectly straight, and his flukes vertically rising into the air.\n\u0026ldquo;Show off,\u0026rdquo; Joy said as she hoisted herself up onto the top of the glass, gracefully turning her hips and swinging her tail into the room. She then slid down the glass, letting her tail guide her into a graceful slide across the floor. The water still clung to her body offering lubrication, until she barreled into Mac causing him to spin into her. He caught her in his arms and rolled so that she was pinned beneath him.\n\u0026ldquo;You love me,\u0026rdquo; Mac said grinning like a teenager.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I do,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, pulling him into a kiss.\n\u0026ldquo;Get a room,\u0026rdquo; Brent joked.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t need a room,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, rolling off Joy, her beautiful brown body still dripping with water. \u0026ldquo;We just need water and no one can see us.\u0026rdquo;\nJoy sat up next to Mac, her now larger breasts swaying as she did.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s just incredible,\u0026rdquo; said Annette, her eyes shining. \u0026ldquo;You both look so amazing, so powerful. I can\u0026rsquo;t believe it\u0026rsquo;s only been a day since you both changed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It is pretty incredible,\u0026rdquo; Joy agreed, pulling her wet hair past her ears. \u0026ldquo;Though I envy the other mers' hydrophobia, this wet long hair is a pain in the ass.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You no longer possess an ass,\u0026rdquo; Mac joked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, then what do you call this?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, rolling onto her side, showing off her still very shapely posterior, her dorsal ridge now bisecting two large muscle masses that still looked exactly like a human girl\u0026rsquo;s rear end, and a particularly beautiful one at that.\n\u0026ldquo;Beautiful, that\u0026rsquo;s what I call that,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, giving it a wet slap. Joy squealed and rolled back into a sitting position. \u0026ldquo;But that,\u0026rdquo; he continued, pointing to a spot about halfway down her tail along the front, \u0026ldquo;is your new ass.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, that\u0026rsquo;s my sphincter,\u0026rdquo; Jay said, still pulling tangles from her hair. \u0026ldquo;An ass is the part of your body upon which you sit. My ass is still there,\u0026rdquo; she said pointing to her the back of her hips. \u0026ldquo;My sphincter is the only thing that moved here,\u0026rdquo; she waved her hand down her front. \u0026ldquo;Now, you have to move over there,\u0026rdquo; she told Mac, pointing to a spot along the far wall. \u0026ldquo;I have work to do,\u0026rdquo; she announced, rolling her shoulders so that her breasts moved seductively.\n\u0026ldquo;Does it feel different, your sphincter, I mean?\u0026rdquo; Kyle asked, then blushing realizing the intimacy the question suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;Not in any way I think I could describe,\u0026rdquo; Joy said ignoring Kyle\u0026rsquo;s discomfort. \u0026ldquo;I was never much for the backdoor to begin with, and now it\u0026rsquo;s even less important to me as an erogenous zone. But these,\u0026rdquo; she continued, hefting her breasts, watching a bit of milk ooze from each nipple. \u0026ldquo;These are much more interesting than they used to be.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They are bigger too,\u0026rdquo; Annette observed. \u0026ldquo;Will that happen to me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t you talk to Pat on the radio about the strategy for today?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t talk much about me, mostly about Brent, remember?\u0026rdquo; Annette said.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yes. Right. Well, how big they might be has a lot to do with what Mac is imagining,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;So, what do you want?\u0026rdquo; she asked, turning to her pod-mate who had scooted over to the far wall.\n\u0026ldquo;Breasts are just as interesting to me as they always were,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;But as you can see from Joy, I was never into freakishly large breasts.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a relief,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. She noticed that her husband had become very quiet. \u0026ldquo;You O.K.?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, sure,\u0026rdquo; Brent said without much conviction.\n\u0026ldquo;You sure?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t sound sure.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine,\u0026rdquo; Brent said, with more bravado. \u0026ldquo;So, how should we do this, or rather, what is it that I have to do?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are being very brave,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, looking at her husband of many years. \u0026ldquo;I promise you that you\u0026rsquo;ll be very happy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know. And I do love you,\u0026rdquo; Brent said, looking, and feeling, every inch the frail, old man he appeared to be. \u0026ldquo;I just don\u0026rsquo;t know if I can \u0026hellip; if I can \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, don\u0026rsquo;t worry,\u0026rdquo; said Annette. \u0026ldquo;The first part is easy. We both feed from Joy.\u0026rdquo;\nBrent glanced down at Joy\u0026rsquo;s beautiful breasts, her dark brown nipples extended, with the mermaid milk that was oozing from the tips in stark, white contrast.\n\u0026ldquo;That shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too difficult,\u0026rdquo; he joked as he sat down on the other side of Joy, glancing over at Mac to make sure he was still against the wall.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad you approve,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, her young face smiling at her old friend. \u0026ldquo;How often do you get to play with another woman\u0026rsquo;s breasts while your wife watches and not get in any trouble, eh?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There will be no playing, just feeding,\u0026rdquo; Annette said with mock anger. \u0026ldquo;Got it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Got it,\u0026rdquo; Brent said, feeling some of the tension leave his body. \u0026ldquo;So, how long will this take?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;Pat seemed to think it might be anywhere between three days to three weeks. We don\u0026rsquo;t have the actual Moon Pool, though this tank is lovely, Jack. We don\u0026rsquo;t have the tiaras that Rose makes, which speed things up, but we do have a steady supply of mermaid milk, and two mers with fully developed mer-organs to focus their energies on our transformation. I guess we\u0026rsquo;ll just have to find out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just lean back and let me cradle your head,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Annette will be right next to you.\u0026rdquo;\nBrent turned onto his back, letting Joy support the back of his head. She brought him to her breast, and he took the nipple into his mouth and began to suck. Immediately, a stream of warm, sweet, milk gushed into his mouth, and within seconds he could feel the tingling effects of the siren cells as they began their work on his body. Annette\u0026rsquo;s head brushed against his own as she began feeding on Joy\u0026rsquo;s other breast, and Brent felt his body relax some more.\nJoy sighed with contentment, the wash of hormones released from feeding flowing through her body. It felt so good, so satisfying to feed someone. It was even more satisfying to do two at once! She could feel the milk flowing from her body, her breasts becoming less full. For several minutes, the room was silent except for the gentle sounds of sucking and drinking.\nBrent felt the flow slacken, and as it stopped, he gave Joy\u0026rsquo;s nipple one last kiss, whisking away a final droplet of milk. As he pulled back from her breast, he laid his head on her tail, just below her pelvic fins, and watched as Annette finished her transformational meal, her gray-blond hair silvery in the morning light filtering down from the skylight above. When Annette pulled away, Brent felt a hand on his leg. He turned and saw that Mac had stealthily moved to his side, and had grabbed him. His stomach lurched, and he reflexively kicked his leg, but Mac held on and pulled Brent to him, his head thumping on the floor as it fell from Joy\u0026rsquo;s lap.\n\u0026ldquo;What the fu\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo; Brent said before Mac clamped his hand over Brent\u0026rsquo;s face, silencing him. Mac quickly wrapped his other arm around Brent\u0026rsquo;s torso and drew him into a bear hug, pinning his arms at his sides. When Brent kicked his legs, Mac wrapped his tail around them, tightening his hold on Brent like a boa constrictor. Brent tried to scream, but his mouth was securely covered by Mac\u0026rsquo;s strong, brown hand. He didn\u0026rsquo;t expect Mac to be so strong. God, he was strong!\n\u0026ldquo;Shush,\u0026rdquo; Mac said softly. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll be fine, don\u0026rsquo;t struggle.\u0026rdquo;\nKyle and Jack watched with shock on their faces. The scene reminded both men of an antelope in a lion\u0026rsquo;s jaws, the life and death struggle of the antelope contrasted with the power and confidence of the lion. Brent\u0026rsquo;s eyes showed both his terror and his effort as he struggled against Mac\u0026rsquo;s unrelenting embrace, his entire body straining and jerking. But Mac was unshakable. Time seemed to slow to an agonizing pace, and Brent could feel a fiery tickle that ran up along the base of his spine before sputtering out at the base of his skull. After a few more seconds, Brent gave one last great heave and then finally stopped struggling, lying limp in Mac\u0026rsquo;s arms. Annette scrambled from Joy\u0026rsquo;s side to embrace her husband.\n\u0026ldquo;You are so brave,\u0026rdquo; she said, tears in her eyes. \u0026ldquo;I love you so much,\u0026rdquo; kissing his forehead.\nBrent\u0026rsquo;s eyes softened as his wife kissed him, and Mac took his hand away from his face, but kept the other arm firmly about his waist. Mac brought his arm around Annette, and hugged her next to Brent. Joy salamandered over to the trio, and laid her upper torso over Brent\u0026rsquo;s, her breasts pressing into his chest, her face before his.\n\u0026ldquo;You are very brave,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, and kissed him gently on the lips.\nBrent felt the kiss melt across his lips like warm chocolate, and his body seemed to fall into Mac\u0026rsquo;s as Joy pressed down on him. He recognized a twinge of desire for the strong male body holding him, even as he was suddenly jealous of the warm fullness of Joy\u0026rsquo;s youthful breasts as they pressed against his own flat, old, chest. Joy\u0026rsquo;s tongue snaked into his mouth as he felt Annette kissing his shoulder and neck, and Brent decided that the feelings that were building in his body were good ones, and she embraced them. She fought a joyful duel with Joy\u0026rsquo;s tongue, which the mermaid energetically returned.\n\u0026ldquo;See,\u0026rdquo; said Joy as she broke from the passionate kiss, her own face flush with desire. \u0026ldquo;I told you that you would be fine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now that\u0026rsquo;s a bonnie lass,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, releasing her from his grasp. He reached around all three girls and brought them into a group hug.\n\u0026ldquo;I like that,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, snuggling into Mac\u0026rsquo;s shoulder, kissing the top of her head.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you like?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Bonnie,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, tilting her face up and drawing her into a kiss. They kissed a long soulful kiss, while Mac stroked her short, brown and gray-speckled hair. They separated from the kiss, her eyes watery with emotion.\n\u0026ldquo;Bonnie?\u0026rdquo; she asked, sounding it out for herself. \u0026ldquo;Bonnie,\u0026rdquo; she repeated. \u0026ldquo;I like that too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Bart,\u0026rdquo; are you alright?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn asked, clicking on the radio\u0026rsquo;s send button.\n\u0026ldquo;Hank \u0026hellip; er \u0026hellip; Jaclyn?\u0026rdquo; Bart stumbled.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Bart, that\u0026rsquo;s right, Jaclyn,\u0026rdquo; she repeated, smiling at the rest of her pod as they enjoyed the surprise and amazement Bart was showing.\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously, right?\u0026rdquo; Bart continued. \u0026ldquo;You turned into a girl?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, I turned into a mermaid, Bart,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;A real, live mermaid. Now, I need you to pull it together, buddy. I\u0026rsquo;ve given you all the keywords, you know it\u0026rsquo;s real, so let\u0026rsquo;s get it together!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Jaci, go easy on the man,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;His heart is strong, but it\u0026rsquo;s not shatterproof.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And Janice, is that you?\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;Your voice sounds different.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;m a mermaid too,\u0026rdquo; Janice answered. \u0026ldquo;Our voices are even prettier live than over the airwaves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a mermaid too?\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;But \u0026hellip; what \u0026hellip; how \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re still married, technically,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll understand when we send you more information.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Both you and Hank \u0026hellip; er \u0026hellip; Jaclyn \u0026hellip; mermaids!\u0026rdquo; Bart said, shocked.\n\u0026ldquo;As are all three of our kids,\u0026rdquo; Janice said. \u0026ldquo;Even Robbie is now a mermaid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;This is incredible.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;So, can you do it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do what?\u0026rdquo; Bart asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Establish my new legal identity and assemble a group of experts to serve on the board of trustees for the MMI,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;I would imagine that the second part is easier than the first.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right. That,\u0026rdquo; Bart said, still stunned. \u0026ldquo;I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s probably a good thing you signed over all power of attorney to me. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure we could get your new sex changed pretty easily, but your change in species might be more problematic. We\u0026rsquo;ll have to make you public knowledge to someone. I\u0026rsquo;ll do what you say, of course, but the American government is not under any obligation to recognize mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know we have a long, hard road ahead,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn agreed. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m still me, and I still plan on running both the MMI and our foundation. I\u0026rsquo;m glad to hear that I can depend on you, my friend. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what I would do without you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know either,\u0026rdquo; agreed Bart. \u0026ldquo;But if your foundation keeps growing like this, I mean \u0026hellip; this is just incredible. You were already really, really rich, but when we add the Wainwright assets and the Baker estate and trust, assuming the this deal goes through on Taylor Island, well then\u0026ndash;Christ!\u0026ndash; only the Gates Foundation will have more assets than we do!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, that even impresses me,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;I hope that that amount of money can solve a thorny identity problem.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it can\u0026rsquo;t hurt,\u0026rdquo; Bart agreed. \u0026ldquo;It will open a lot of doors, but some doors can\u0026rsquo;t be pried open. I mean, imagine what Focus on the Family will have to say about you and the MMI!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve already imagined, but you do what you think is best. We trust your judgment,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;And you\u0026rsquo;re welcome to come for a visit any time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, no! Not me,\u0026rdquo; Bart said with a laugh. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll happily stay a landlubber and keep your affairs here nice and tidy. This job pays very well, thanks to you and your generosity, but I\u0026rsquo;ll stay on dry land.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to give the radio over to Pat, and she\u0026rsquo;s going to dictate some stuff we need you to purchase for us, and she\u0026rsquo;ll also detail how we need it delivered,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;We can be patient on the identity problem for the moment, but it puts you in a precarious position, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How so,\u0026rdquo; Bart asked.\n\u0026ldquo;If something were to happen to you, the entire foundation could go into probate,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve made provisions for that, actually, a long time ago. I have a group of like-minded men and women who know I\u0026rsquo;m protecting an environmental group from exploitation. That group has been named executors of all my business and legacy accounts. A few of them will be tapped for the MMI Board. You\u0026rsquo;ll be as well protected as you can be, legally at any rate.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s at least a relief,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;Thanks, and here\u0026rsquo;s Pat.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wait,\u0026rdquo; Bart interrupted.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m still here,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said.\n\u0026ldquo;Technically, you are in Kiribati,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;And while MMI owns the island, thank you very much, you and your family, regardless of your sex or your species, are there illegally.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m aware of that,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;I was hoping that you would be able to solve that issue as well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;I will do my best, but there are two issues here: the first, is that we may have an easier time with our trans-species citizenship once I get you in Kiribati legally. The second is that there are probably others there in your position, yes?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, over Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. \u0026ldquo;Many of us are not here on a visa or other legal authority.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought as much,\u0026rdquo; Bart.\n\u0026ldquo;Is this a problem?\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Everything is potentially a problem,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;And money is a near universal cure for most problems. We\u0026rsquo;ll take this slow, but we have some big work to do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I will be guided by your excellent advice, my friend,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;You just tell me what you need me to do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve given me most of your legal documents for you and your family in Appendix T, which I suppose stands for tail, right?\u0026rdquo; asked Bart.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;Sorry for the pun.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s fine,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll need to get similar documents for everyone else, and that will take time and money.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Both of which you have,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;ll need your say so to and the list of your people to start that process. I can keep things out of the public eye for a long time, but not forever. You\u0026rsquo;re going to have to come up with a coming out party of some kind.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re working on that, Mr. Kolbert,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Here, you might as well take over Pat,\u0026rdquo; said Jaclyn. \u0026ldquo;You have my say so, Bart, and Pat will give you that list of stuff, and all the information you need,\u0026rdquo; she finished as she moved aside to let Pat have the microphone.\n\u0026ldquo;Hello Mr. Kolbert,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;I suppose you\u0026rsquo;re a mermaid too,\u0026rdquo; Bart joked. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got that same bell thing going on in your voice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, we are all mers here, or will be shortly,\u0026rdquo; Pat said thinking of Harold. \u0026ldquo;One of the things we\u0026rsquo;re ordering today, with your help, is a better satellite up-link for telecommunications, Internet and such. The next time we talk, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yes,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;Well, mermaid or not, please call me Bart. All of Hank\u0026rsquo;s, ah, er, Jaclyn\u0026rsquo;s friends should call me Bart.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, Bart,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;You ready for the information?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pencil\u0026rsquo;s sharp, and ready to go,\u0026rdquo; he answered.\nThe stars twinkled in their multitudes above a perfectly white, sandy beach that curved like a scimitar around a small lagoon. Behind the beach, a single cone of a small volcano rose up dramatically from the small jungle that encircled it on three sides. The scene might have looked like a painting of a perfect little paradise to someone hovering overhead, but no airplane was visible in the vast expanse of the peaceful, night sky. The small island looked and felt like it was the only inhabited place in a universe of ocean.\nAssembled on in the middle of that arching beach was a large group of mermaids and mermen, their many colors visible even in the starlight. Intermingled among this colorful and beautiful throng were a smaller group of humans, and in the center of everyone, two men were trussed up together, each bound to the other, their legs outstretched in opposite directions. Both men seemed physically tired to the point of exhaustion, but their minds were alert and their hearts were beating in terror.\nThey had been on the beach since late afternoon, sharing stories. The first to go were the mers, many of them speaking, sharing the tale of how they got there, and what had happened to them. Harold Matthews, who had spent the longest among mers while still being a human, went next. Several of the mers noted the interest two of the captive girls seemed to show in the handsome young man. Then each of the rescued girls shared their brief tales, then Sudhish, and then the human members of the rescue team. By now, it was late evening; the sun had been gone from the sky for about an hour. Only two more people had yet to share their story. The two men lying trussed up in the center of the group.\nOne of the mermaids took off a utility belt she was wearing, salamandered over to the two men, and put her hand over the younger man\u0026rsquo;s forehead. He started to say something, but a single glance from the mermaid stopped him. She looked at him for many minutes, studying his face, never moving her hand from his head.\nThe boy noted that her skin was impossibly smooth and her touch was gentle. Her face was mesmerizing, beautiful, and captivating, and the boy could not look away from her. She had hazel eyes that sparkled rich hues of color from within and long auburn hair. Nestled within her thick, luxurious hair was a sparkling tiara that went just across her forehead just below her hairline. It lay flush to her skin, perfectly fitted to her individual skull, and it looked as though it had been woven from thousands of tiny strands of wire, though no wire he\u0026rsquo;d ever seen sparkled and shimmered with color and light like these did. In the center of the gleaming, silvery diadem was an ornamental peak that lay flat against the mermaid\u0026rsquo;s forehead, and it looked like folds in a blanket, but more complex, like an Escher drawing. Along each temple another ornamental weaving depicted a staff encircled by intertwining snakes.\nThe artistic and medical contexts of the symbols were lost on the young boy, but he marveled in the beauty and power the crown seemed to give to the mermaid. Her sea green tail had pink highlights, marking her as the apparent sister to one of the other mers who looked much like her. However, this mermaid had an extraordinarily gentle manner about her, and her eyes seemed to pierce right through the young man\u0026rsquo;s soul.\n\u0026ldquo;I want you to answer my sister\u0026rsquo;s questions slowly and honestly,\u0026rdquo; she said to him. \u0026ldquo;Do not lie, I will know.\u0026rdquo;\nThe young man, barely twenty-one, nodded.\nThe other mermaid who almost looked like her twin, salamandered closer, settling her tail along the other side of the young man\u0026rsquo;s legs. The boy noticed that this mermaid\u0026rsquo;s tiara lacked any ornamentation at her temples, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to suggest that this mermaid was less important than the others. He could tell that this one was the lead mermaid. She crossed her arms under her considerable breasts and gave the young man a severe look.\n\u0026ldquo;Your name is Torro Dimaunahan, correct?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\nThe young man said \u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; softly.\n\u0026ldquo;The man behind you is your father, Malaki?\u0026rdquo; Pat continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Torro repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you know where your other brothers are?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you know why you are here?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Your people brought me here,\u0026rdquo; he answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you know why we have brought you here?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s something my father has done,\u0026rdquo; he said with some venom.\n\u0026ldquo;Keep your fucking mouth shut, you idiot,\u0026rdquo; Malaki hissed.\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck you,\u0026rdquo; Torro retorted. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll tell these people anything they want to know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t seem to like your father much,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, looking at her sister Bridget to see how Torro was doing. Bridget gave her a wink that told her Torro was being very truthful at the moment.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s a bastard, and he deserves to die,\u0026rdquo; Torro spat, despite his venom induced lethargy.\n\u0026ldquo;I very much agree with you,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;But why do you feel that way?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He killed my mother,\u0026rdquo; Torro gasped. \u0026ldquo;I have sworn revenge,\u0026rdquo; his words tinged with both anger and sadness. \u0026ldquo;I have sworn it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I will kill you, you bastard whore-son!\u0026rdquo; Malaki spat.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not going to kill anyone,\u0026rdquo; Pat said casually. \u0026ldquo;And if you cannot be quiet, we will put the gag back on. You threatened Sudhish, remember? Do you understand that all we ask is that you wait your turn?\u0026rdquo; Malaki was silent. \u0026ldquo;I said, do \u0026hellip; you \u0026hellip; understand?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked with deadly seriousness.\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck you!\u0026rdquo; Malaki said.\n\u0026ldquo;Why is it that everyone in your organization always says the same thing? John, my darling, would you do the honors?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked in a cheery voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course my dear,\u0026rdquo; John said, salamandering over to Malaki and effortlessly slipping a gag over his mouth and securing it behind his head. Malaki\u0026rsquo;s outburst was muffled behind the gag, and he gave in a few seconds, knowing that the mers wouldn\u0026rsquo;t release the gag a second time.\n\u0026ldquo;Much better,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Now, where were we, oh, yes, Torro wants to kill his father. How very Greek.\u0026rdquo; She looked at her sister again.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s telling the truth,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. \u0026ldquo;Pulse, breathing, pupils, skin temperature, everything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about your heart?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked. \u0026ldquo;What does your heart tell you, my sister?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Torro is as much a victim as Emma, Sudhish, or any of the others,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. Pat nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;Torro, what else can you tell us of your father?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked. Behind Torro, Malaki again struggled weakly against his bonds and screamed into his gag. Torro waited for his father to give up, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t have to wait long. Malaki could not keep up his tirade under the influence of mermaid venom and slumped against his son.\n\u0026ldquo;My father looks like a successful business man; politically connected, sending all his sons to the best universities money can buy, but he actually runs one of the largest crime syndicates in the world,\u0026rdquo; Torro said. \u0026ldquo;His organization runs under the cover of a legitimate business exporting trinkets and wood to the West, but what he really does is import and export weapons, drugs, and prostitutes. You already know about the Basra\u0026rsquo;s and their story, and the Thompson\u0026rsquo;s story and how Alberto was my father\u0026rsquo;s number one man. But he\u0026rsquo;s worse than that. He kills people as a business practice, as a hobby, just for fun. He killed my \u0026hellip; my \u0026hellip; mother when I was very young as an example to his sons, my older brothers mostly, to show us what happened to anyone who disobeyed him. She \u0026hellip; she \u0026hellip; she tried to protect me from a beating; that was her disobedience. She fought to protect me, and he \u0026hellip; he \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Torro stopped, trying to regain control of his emotions.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s awful,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed. \u0026ldquo;Go on,\u0026rdquo; she encouraged.\n\u0026ldquo;He killed her because she loved me,\u0026rdquo; Torro said, barely holding it together. \u0026ldquo;She loved me \u0026hellip; he killed her! He must die!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Torro, we believe you,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, looking at his face earnestly. \u0026ldquo;But we are working very hard on not killing people. Do you think you could let justice take its course and not kill your father?\u0026rdquo;\nTorro looked from Bridget to Pat and then to the surrounding mers and humans he could see. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to stem the tears that had arisen unbidden. Finally, he could bear it no longer, and sobbed out, \u0026ldquo;My mother \u0026hellip; it was my mother \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; have \u0026hellip; sworn.\u0026rdquo; He now sobbed uncontrollably.\nBridget moved in closer to the boy, and gathered him into her arms, pressing his head into her shoulder and breast. She held him while he gasped out great, heaving sobs of mourning. No one spoke, but one could hear several of the mers and humans choking back their own tears. Many had lost loved ones, and the wrenching sounds of honest loss were impossible to ignore. After many minutes, Torro calmed down and stopped sobbing. Elise salamandered over to her pod-mate and handed her a strip of cloth from the medical utility belt that all the mers in James' pod wore. Bridget used it to clean the boy\u0026rsquo;s face.\n\u0026ldquo;We should untie the boy,\u0026rdquo; Elise said to Pat, who nodded in agreement. Together they released Torro from his shared captivity with his father. He collapsed into Bridget\u0026rsquo;s embrace and curled into a ball.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you going to do?\u0026rdquo; Debra asked as she joined her pod-mates in comforting the boy.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not going to do anything. WE are going to share responsibility for any justice we undertake,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. She turned to the older, still human, Emma who was surrounded by the surviving Basra\u0026rsquo;s, Sudhish, Rani, and Vidya. \u0026ldquo;What do you wish to have done?\u0026rdquo;\nEmma said nothing, her eyes full of hatred. She looked over at Sudhish, and he nodded, an unspoken agreement passed between them. Sudhish looked over at his old boss, and then at his two sisters, and finally returned to Emma\u0026rsquo;s disfigured but gentle face. \u0026ldquo;Death is too good for him,\u0026rdquo; he spat.\n\u0026ldquo;We could force him to join his sons,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Even if he joined his other sons as a dolphin,\u0026rdquo; said Rani, her eyes hard and cold. \u0026ldquo;I could not live in the same waters with such a creature.\u0026rdquo; Emma, Vidya, and Sudhish nodded vigorously in agreement.\nMalaki Dimaunahan listened to the conversation with growing horror and despair. He knew he was going to die, of that much he was certain. But how was he to die? He feared some kind of transformation the most. It was almost surreal when the mers had called up his former sons to the beach, watching the small pod of dolphins frolic in the shallow surf, and trying to understand that two of the creatures were actually his sons. Impossible, but then so too were mermaids. They were all around him, and he could not escape the possibility that they could actually have transformed his sons into dolphins.\nAnything but a mere beast, a food source! No, he must die the death of a man, but how? He was kept weakened by their venom (at least he now knew what was done to him), and he could barely stand. He tried to shut out the argument that was rising in intensity around him to come up with a plan for taking some sort of control of the situation. How he wished that, like Alberto\u0026ndash;that crafty son of a bitch\u0026ndash;he had a hidden weapon on his body. At least he could take his son with him in death, and maybe a few of these hideously beautiful creatures.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not comfortable with killing a captive,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;I want being a mer to mean something different, maybe even better, than being human. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to become a society that regularly kills humans!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The number one predator of humans is humans,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s not be too romantic about what it might mean to be mer or human. Life is pretty messy, and it shares more similarities across species than differences. Someday, the most dangerous thing to a mer might be another mer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I hope not,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not what I imagined or hoped for when all this started.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I hope not either,\u0026rdquo; John said, putting his arm around his pod-mate. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m just saying it\u0026rsquo;s possible.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pat, I\u0026rsquo;m confused,\u0026rdquo; Danni said, laying the sleeping Freya next to her sister Maureen and salamandering to her pod-mate. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between not killing Malaki and The Device?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Danni!\u0026rdquo; Pat said, surprised and angered by her own pod-mate\u0026rsquo;s challenge. \u0026ldquo;Please, not now,\u0026rdquo; she pleaded, pointing to their captives and new guests.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Danni said softly but firmly, \u0026ldquo;we must talk about it now. It\u0026rsquo;s been hanging over everything for a long time, and no one here is leaving this island. They will all join us, in one form or another, or die. You know that to be true. It\u0026rsquo;s safe to talk about.\u0026rdquo;\nPat looked at Phoebe and saw her other pod-mate nod in agreement. She looked behind her at Galina and Alexis, and they both nodded as well.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, we will talk about it,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;No one stopped Petra, Gail, and Xing when they killed Alberto,\u0026rdquo; Danni argued. \u0026ldquo;There was justice there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Vengeance is never justice,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not saying Alberto didn\u0026rsquo;t deserve to die, but we killed him because he killed Michael, not because we were serving some higher purpose.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And what higher purpose should we be serving when we are confronted with someone who kills us to get what he or she wants?\u0026rdquo; demanded Gabriel in a low voice. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t we deserve to be able to protect ourselves? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that the primary purpose of The Device?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, but The Device isn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to kill anyone,\u0026rdquo; Pat argued. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a fail-safe.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If that device represents safety, then we have already failed,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not saying you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have done it, but Pat, you have to understand that we should be trying to work towards a solution wherein the thing we do as soon as we can is to dismantle and destroy that horrific device because we won\u0026rsquo;t need it anymore.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I agree, absolutely!\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;And that\u0026rsquo;s why we\u0026rsquo;re trying to build a society here that is better than merely our instincts.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Love is an instinct,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, looking at her pod-mates. \u0026ldquo;I think we should try to live up to our instincts, and not try to be better than them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Galina is right,\u0026rdquo; Danni argued. \u0026ldquo;What is greater than the power of love? That\u0026rsquo;s what binds us all together. We can call it mer-bonds, or part of our CHEW, or just plain old love, but none of that matters. Love is the same no matter how it occurs, and no matter in what brains it occurs! Love is greater than that damned device and its life-ending chemical reaction.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Love is also a chemical reaction,\u0026rdquo; Galina said. \u0026ldquo;In our brains \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s true.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t care if love is a post card from outer space!\u0026rdquo; Danni argued. \u0026ldquo;It is still something that happens to us. It\u0026rsquo;s real. It actually happens, especially if it is a chemical reaction. Those chemicals had to be released and mixed together for a reason. Love is the reason. Love is real. Love changed me from a failed, miserable, drug-runner into a loved and loving person, a mother! Don\u0026rsquo;t you see, we need to be guided by the love we share, both when it\u0026rsquo;s romantic and wonderful and when it is dangerous and dark.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The Device isn\u0026rsquo;t merely a chemical reaction, and neither is love,\u0026rdquo; Pat argued. \u0026ldquo;Both are complex, and both are real. But so too is the threat that the world will not allow us to live in peace, or that we\u0026rsquo;ll be overwhelmed by those who would exploit us or enslave us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But our strategies, our plans, should still be based on love,\u0026rdquo; Danni said. \u0026ldquo;This is a truth I know; it\u0026rsquo;s a truth you, and Phoebe, and John have taught me. But mostly it\u0026rsquo;s a truth that Freya, Cynthia, and Maureen have taught me \u0026hellip; taught all of us. Can\u0026rsquo;t you see that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s right,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said, still stroking Torro\u0026rsquo;s head. \u0026ldquo;Love is the answer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But I don\u0026rsquo;t know what that means,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;What answer to slavery, murder, prostitution, or China simply attacking and overwhelming us can we find in love? Love couldn\u0026rsquo;t even save Christ from being killed or his message being twisted into the most violent forms of hate and murder the world has ever known. I mean, good god, look at our brother.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Your brother?\u0026rdquo; asked Michael. \u0026ldquo;Who is your brother?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Our brother,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Cory is a Christian Fundamentalist who lives in Kansas. He\u0026rsquo;s not as bad as Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church, but he\u0026rsquo;s close.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s bad,\u0026rdquo; agreed Michael. \u0026ldquo;Phelps is a nut.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sadly, Cory might be one too,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. \u0026ldquo;But he and other religious fanatics who act like him aren\u0026rsquo;t guided by love. He is guided by fear; fear of punishment, fear of eternity, fear of exclusion.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, how can we be guided by love?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;When someone or something doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand or share in the basic force of love, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t tolerate it. You have to give love to receive it,\u0026rdquo; Bridget finished with a nod to the boy she still held. \u0026ldquo;It can be a form of love to kill something or someone who threatens you and those you love.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But isn\u0026rsquo;t that exactly what our fanatical brother says?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, exasperated. \u0026ldquo;Homosexuals, Muslims, non-believers, Lady Gaga, whatever! He says they all threaten him.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If he kills one of them, then he is a threat,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. \u0026ldquo;If he doesn\u0026rsquo;t, he\u0026rsquo;s just a pain in the ass.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t understand the line, once you kill someone, like we are contemplating doing\u0026ndash;\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Like we already have done!\u0026rdquo; Danni interrupted.\n\u0026ldquo;How is it that we cannot say that the person who loved that person cannot say that they killed one of us out of love?\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s always the heart of the moral problem,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said.\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck you is never a response made with love,\u0026rdquo; John said, indicating Malaki. \u0026ldquo;I know you want us to become a more perfect society, better than human, but I think everyone is right. We cannot reform or save the human race, and while we can force individuals to be changed,\u0026rdquo; looking over at Liga who nodded slowly in recognition of John\u0026rsquo;s compassion in this argument. \u0026ldquo;We must acknowledge that identity death is still a death. It\u0026rsquo;s still killing someone. We didn\u0026rsquo;t kill the cells that constituted Manalo, Abao, and that other guy, but we killed their identities.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So what are you saying?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I think that love is our highest good, and we do not seek to kill others, even if they hate us,\u0026rdquo; John answered, slowly salamandering over to his mate. \u0026ldquo;But when they have killed, and not because we have bodily threatened them, we are justified in eliminating further threat to our loved ones and to our people.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I just don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel right.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Killing never feels right,\u0026rdquo; John agreed, putting an arm around his beautiful pod-mate. \u0026ldquo;This is probably a good thing for both humans and mers. If we ever get to the point where killing no longer troubles us, we are doomed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, what do we do?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, lost and afraid, putting her head on John\u0026rsquo;s shoulder.\n\u0026ldquo;We sleep on it,\u0026rdquo; John said. \u0026ldquo;Nothing needs to be done right now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about the boy?\u0026rdquo; Bridget asked.\n\u0026ldquo;If you won\u0026rsquo;t let me kill my father,\u0026rdquo; Torro said, lifting his face from Bridget\u0026rsquo;s chest. \u0026ldquo;Then you must kill me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not killing anyone tonight,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said. \u0026ldquo;Right? That includes you. If you can\u0026rsquo;t promise not to harm your father, at least until we say so, then we will have to tie you up again. Do you understand?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You might let me kill my father?\u0026rdquo; Torro asked, sitting up straighter.\nBridget looked to Pat and the others.\n\u0026ldquo;We might,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, shaking her head sadly.\nFour hours after their first feeding, Annette and Bonnie both felt twenty years younger. Both still looked, more or less, like they normally did, but they felt wonderful. There were alone, the four of them, on the small, wind-blown island. Kyle had taken The Slipper and Jackson back to the mainland. They were going to finalize some documents for Bart Kolbert and to meet with some of their old friends, relatives, and a few others. They joked that it was a fishing trip on dry land. Annette and Bonnie had taken a walk outside, while Mac and Joy had swum out the tunnel and surveyed the water around the island. After about an hour of exploration, they joined Bonnie and Annette at the dock. The two humans bundled against the cold, sitting on the end of the dock, and the two mers, naked in the dark water of the bay at their feet.\n\u0026ldquo;My flukes are actually touching the bottom,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s only about eight feet deep here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I can just reach it,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, her chin just clearing the choppy water.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe you\u0026rsquo;re not freezing!\u0026rdquo; Annette exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;It makes me cold just to look at you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The water is cold,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;We can feel it. It just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me cold. I mean, I don\u0026rsquo;t feel cold myself, even though I can feel that the water is very cold.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How is that possible?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked. \u0026ldquo;Cold is one of my biggest pet peeves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mer-organs,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s amazing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t all women cold?\u0026rdquo; Bonnie teased.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll be one shortly,\u0026rdquo; Annette shot back. \u0026ldquo;Then we\u0026rsquo;ll see who hogs the covers!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We won\u0026rsquo;t be human long enough for that to happen,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said ruefully.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll be one before you start to transition to mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;So you\u0026rsquo;ll have at least one night as a full-fledged girl.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ha,\u0026rdquo; Annette said.\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of which, what\u0026rsquo;s our schedule?\u0026rdquo; Bonnie asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We should head back in,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;Every four hours, just like a baby.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure?\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I thought it was once a day.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It was when you were there,\u0026rdquo; Annette agreed. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;ve been talking to Pat every day for the past week, and the new data suggest that each dose does its major work in the first few hours. The body can tolerate the next dose in about four hours.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that a good idea?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked. \u0026ldquo;I mean, we\u0026rsquo;re a bit different from the mers out west.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re still mers,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t prove it to you, but I just know it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, several of the mers fed more than once a day,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, \u0026ldquo;Starting with the second group of mers who didn\u0026rsquo;t use the original goop Pat invented but drank from Danni and Pat themselves.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I guess I didn\u0026rsquo;t know that,\u0026rdquo; Joy said.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m all for speeding it up,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s really weird to feel one way in here,\u0026rdquo; she said tapping her head, \u0026ldquo;and to look a different way out here,\u0026rdquo; she finished waving her hand over her still male body.\n\u0026ldquo;That must be awful,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thousands already deal with it,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said, thoughtfully. \u0026ldquo;I never thought about LGBT people before, but this experience has really opened my eyes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I suppose it would,\u0026rdquo; Annette agreed. \u0026ldquo;My, what an amazing journey we are undertaking. Let\u0026rsquo;s continue, shall we?\u0026rdquo; she said, standing up.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll see you in a few,\u0026rdquo; Mac agreed, and he and Joy ducked below the dark water and disappeared.\n\u0026ldquo;We shall,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said, standing up and taking her wife\u0026rsquo;s hand. \u0026ldquo;As long as we\u0026rsquo;re together, I won\u0026rsquo;t care what I look like.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If only more people were like you,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, giving him a peck on his cheek.\n\u0026ldquo;I wasn\u0026rsquo;t always like me,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said. \u0026ldquo;Mermaid milk is probably one of the most powerful things on the planet. I was a Navy man, remember? This is still strange for me, but I feel now like it must happen. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be Mac\u0026rsquo;s pod-mate and your lesbian lover shortly, and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing that will stop it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s hope so,\u0026rdquo; Annette agreed, and they walked towards the house.\n\u0026ldquo;Goodnight, Mom,\u0026rdquo; Rikki, Cleo, and Emma said in unison as they turned into the shallow surf and disappeared into the water. Emma Henderson watched the dark waves crash along the shore, waiting for her three daughters to join MuSu, who waited beyond the breakers for his pod-mates. After only a few seconds, my goodness those girls can swim fast now, she thought, they appeared next to their handsome mate and waved goodbye one more time. Emma waved and turned back towards the huts that were nestled along the line between the jungle and the beach. She felt a tug of anger as she glanced at the hut where Malaki lay shackled to the wall, wondering if she should break their collective promise and simply kill him where he lay.\nNo, she shook her head. Life should be sought, not death. Death would come, eventually, to all of us, no need to add her energy to its power. She instead continued her slow walk towards the hut she had been assigned. As she passed by the hut the Basras shared, she heard a sob. Poor Sudhish, he was really struggling. She changed her course and entered their dark hut.\n\u0026ldquo;Emma?\u0026rdquo; Rani asked as she entered.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s me,\u0026rdquo; she replied as she lowered herself next to the girl she had often cared for over the past few months. They could all see one another dimly in the far-away light of the stars, and Vidya held Sudhish in her arms as he buried his face in her tee shirt. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sudhish,\u0026rdquo; Rani said. \u0026ldquo;He wants to kill Malaki.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who doesn\u0026rsquo;t?\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s going to be a long line for that one. But why is he crying?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sudhish?\u0026rdquo; Rani prompted. \u0026ldquo;Please, tell her.\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish lifted his face from his sister\u0026rsquo;s embrace and turned to Emma. Even in the darkness, Emma could tell that Sudhish looked awful. The last few days had sucked the life from his eyes and face, and he looked like the hollow shell of a man, a small man, where the slightest breeze might blow him away. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m failing at keeping my honor,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;How are you failing to keep your honor?\u0026rdquo; Emma asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Because I cannot break my promise to the mers, and so I must allow this man who dishonored my family and killed my sister to live another day,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;I fail at everything I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to do, and I failed to keep my loved one alive. I failed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So did I,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;So did I.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But your girls are alive!\u0026rdquo; He protested.\n\u0026ldquo;My husband, their father, and the only man I ever loved, is not,\u0026rdquo; Emma said simply. She bowed her head and fought to control her own emotions.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; but \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he stopped, looking intently at the small woman before him, her disfigured face visible in the darkness. He suddenly felt smaller and even worse.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry about your husband,\u0026rdquo; he said, subdued. \u0026ldquo;But my parents, my sisters, and my country expected me to protect my sisters. Your husband died protecting you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That may be right,\u0026rdquo; Emma agreed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll try to honor his sacrifice, but Geeta died protecting you and your sisters. You should honor her sacrifice.\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish thought about that for a long moment. He looked at his two sisters and then back at Emma. \u0026ldquo;My sisters have said much the same thing,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Your sisters are wise,\u0026rdquo; Emma agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;They also say I should honor Geeta\u0026rsquo;s sacrifice,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Then you should,\u0026rdquo; Emma agreed. \u0026ldquo;How will you honor Geeta\u0026rsquo;s sacrifice?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I cannot without help,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Will you help me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course, I\u0026rsquo;ll help you, if I can,\u0026rdquo; she reassured him.\n\u0026ldquo;My sisters have told me of your courage, your kindness, and your compassion,\u0026rdquo; he began, sitting up straighter. \u0026ldquo;You are the strongest person I have ever met.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not any of that,\u0026rdquo; Emma protested.\n\u0026ldquo;You are the strongest person I have ever met,\u0026rdquo; he repeated. \u0026ldquo;You can help us. If I was to become a merman, I could not be with my sisters. It would be taboo. I would fail at being a merman as I have failed at being a man. But since I have failed to fulfill my duties as a brother and a man, I can try to honor my sister\u0026rsquo;s sacrifice by becoming her. I could fulfill her destiny, and then I could be with my sisters. Our parents are dead, and we have no one left to us in the world. Will you become our merman?\u0026rdquo;\nEmma\u0026rsquo;s mouth dropped open. She stared back at the three Basras in shock and surprise. Of course she knew now, as did the Basras, about the stories of the other mers, particularly Michael, Gail, and Gabriel. Gender was very plastic with mers, and so she realized that she really could become their merman.\nThe question was: did she want to? She looked carefully at each of them in the darkness. Their eyes were all wet with emotion; they had talked about this already! She had to admit that Rani and Vidya were beautiful young woman, and Sudhish was an elegant young man, if a bit small for her taste. But if he was more like his sister, who was a beauty to be sure, and Emma herself was more like her husband \u0026hellip; her heart nearly broke at that thought, and she brought her fist to her mouth to stop a sob.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said, misunderstanding.\n\u0026ldquo;No, no,\u0026rdquo; Emma reassured him, drawing upon the strength and steel that had gotten her this far. \u0026ldquo;It wasn\u0026rsquo;t you or your request. I just \u0026hellip; my husband, of me taking his place, honoring his sacrifice. He is \u0026hellip; was \u0026hellip; such a good man.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;His goodness is easily seen in his wife and three children,\u0026rdquo; Rani said.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you,\u0026rdquo; Emma said, deeply moved. \u0026ldquo;Actually, for a while, I had completely forgotten that ANY man could be good.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can you be our good man?\u0026rdquo; Vidya asked. \u0026ldquo;You have a heart we trust, and Sudhish cannot bear the thought of continuing to fail as a man. He wants to succeed as a woman.\u0026rdquo;\nEmma thought deeply about what they were asking. She tried to imagine herself a young mermaid, making love to one of the other men she had met. Her stomach lurched again, worse than before. No, she could not be a mermaid to any man. She could become a merman for them!\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; she said, a tear sliding down one of her burned and scarred cheeks. \u0026ldquo;I will become your merman.\u0026rdquo;\nAnnette and Bonnie watched as Mac and Joy acrobatically flipped from the tank to the floor below. They were both laughing like teenagers, giddy with their abilities and stamina, and both Annette and Bonnie felt a twinge of jealousy from Joy getting all the attention. Joy positioned herself next to Mac, facing him, but her hips even with his mid-tail fins. Annette scrambled to one side and flipped to her back while Bonnie went to the other and lay across Mac\u0026rsquo;s tail to position herself under Joy\u0026rsquo;s other breast. Mac positioned his tail so that Bonnie\u0026rsquo;s butt was in the middle of his tail, fully supported, so that she could relax as she fed.\nBonnie lay for a moment on her back, and watched as Annette latched on and began feeding. She looked up and saw the fullness of Joy\u0026rsquo;s breasts, and watched as milk began to sympathetically leak from the unattended nipple. She raised her head and took the fat nipple in her mouth, began to feed, the sweet milk filling her mouth in a constant stream. As she continued to feed, she could feel Mac shifting under her, feeling muscles in his tail clenching and releasing. She wondered what he was doing until she felt a pressure release under her butt and heard Mac sigh as he released his stiffening penis from his vent. A thrill ran up her spine as she realized that the massive cock she had seen when Joy transformed was now sticking up in the air inches from her left hip.\nA brief, internal struggle raged through Bonnie; should she or shouldn\u0026rsquo;t she. She would, she decided, and reached down with her left hand, keeping her lips fastened to Joy\u0026rsquo;s breast, and groped for Mac\u0026rsquo;s cock. She found it, and felt it jump as she touched it. She wrapped her fingers around it, and discovered that it fit nicely into her still male (mostly) hand. She gave it a squeeze of acknowledgement and then returned her hand to the side of Joy\u0026rsquo;s breast, giving her full attention to draining her milk.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, hello there,\u0026rdquo; Joy said dreamily, the hormones from the feeding affecting her. \u0026ldquo;What brings this on?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you kidding?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked. \u0026ldquo;Watching one of the most beautiful women I\u0026rsquo;ve known breast feeding two other women who are going to become some of the most beautiful women I\u0026rsquo;ll know is \u0026hellip; is \u0026hellip; alright by this solider!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;One of the most beautiful women?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked playfully.\n\u0026ldquo;Sally\u0026rsquo;s mother,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, his cock dropping a bit.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Sorry. We\u0026rsquo;ll do our best to be worthy of her memory, won\u0026rsquo;t we girls?\u0026rdquo;\nBoth Annette and Bonnie broke from drinking, gave their assent, and then returned to drinking. Bonnie dropped her hand and gave Mac a few squeezes and strokes, restoring his cock to full attention, and then refocused on her task at Joy\u0026rsquo;s breast. After a about ten minutes, they had drained Joy, and both of them sat up,\n\u0026ldquo;Dessert?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said, taken aback. \u0026ldquo;OH! Yes, I think we should!\u0026rdquo;\nBonnie turned onto her knees and positioned herself at Mac\u0026rsquo;s hips, just below his pelvic fin. She grasped his rampant cock with her right hand and stroked it slowly.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s so smooth and soft,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;And yet so hard.\u0026rdquo;\nJoy indicated to Annette to give her some room, and she flipped herself around, giving Annette equal access to Mac\u0026rsquo;s cock, rolling her hips as only a mermaid can so that her torso remained vertical even with her tail extended out behind her.\n\u0026ldquo;You should start focusing on us,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;Changing us as you like.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, watching Bonnie who was still strongly resembled Brent, stroke his long cock. \u0026ldquo;Well, my dear Annette, for you I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ll do anything. You and Joy were both gorgeous, and so I\u0026rsquo;ll just let you get younger. Bonnie, on the other hand, well I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we can\u0026rsquo;t choose hair color and the like,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re all going to be brown, brown skinned, brown eyed and brown hair. But you can choose body type. Annette was the short, blond bombshell, and I was the tall, striking brunette. What should Bonnie become?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What does Bonnie want to become?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Bonnie doesn\u0026rsquo;t care,\u0026rdquo; she answered. \u0026ldquo;This was never my idea in the first place, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure that it will be wonderful when I\u0026rsquo;m finished.\u0026rdquo; She seemed mesmerized by Mac\u0026rsquo;s cock, and she never took her eyes from hit as she talked. \u0026ldquo;Just pick, but make it so all of you will like me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re all going to love you, my dearest,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;I think you should give Bonnie Joy\u0026rsquo;s height and stature and my curves and hips.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That sounds like a great plan,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, and he furrowed his brow as he focused on Bonnie\u0026rsquo;s head.\n\u0026ldquo;Oooh,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;I can feel that \u0026hellip; wow.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s it feel like?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pressure,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said. \u0026ldquo;But not bad \u0026hellip; like a gentle press of the hand, only from the inside.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We should feed from Mac,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;It speeds things up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We aren\u0026rsquo;t moving fast enough?\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said. \u0026ldquo;Look what I\u0026rsquo;m doing \u0026hellip; and this morning \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, dear, I know,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, her eyes playful. \u0026ldquo;But you could be doing more, like this,\u0026rdquo; she said as she lowered her lips to Mac\u0026rsquo;s cock. She gave the large head a kiss, then a lick, and then she stuffed as much as she could into her mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, yessssss,\u0026rdquo; moaned Mac.\n\u0026ldquo;See?\u0026rdquo; Annette asked as she let it pop out.\nShe reached down and covered Bonnie\u0026rsquo;s hand with her own, and then pushed the cock towards Bonnie. Bonnie lowered her own head to Mac\u0026rsquo;s cock, and drew him into her mouth. He was huge, and salty, and musky, and male! Her senses were overwhelmed with both the feeling and the smell of what she was doing. She sucked as hard as she could, swirling her tongue around the head, moving her hand up and down along his shaft. Mac moaned again. She redoubled her efforts, using both hands and bobbing her head. His great shaft throbed in her hands. She sensed Annette kissing Mac\u0026rsquo;s hips, fins, and stomach, while she urged him to release his siren cells so they could feed. Mac moaned again, and a great spurt exploded into her mouth. Bonnie gagged, swallowing at the same time, and sputtering. She lifted her head, keeping her hands moving along his shaft, and felt a second spurt splash on her face and chin. Annette quickly covered his cock with her mouth and took the next spurt in her mouth, the fourth spurt splashing on her face and chin as she choked down hers.\n\u0026ldquo;God, that was amazing,\u0026rdquo; Mac sighed, spent.\n\u0026ldquo;It was,\u0026rdquo; Joy said breathlessly as she watched Annette and Bonnie kiss and lick each other\u0026rsquo;s faces, cleaning up the mess.\nAt first, the changes were subtle. When Kyle and Jackson returned from the mainland they hardly noticed any changes. By the third feeding later that evening, Annette and Bonnie both looked and felt years younger. Bonnie had stayed close to Mac for the entire day, allowing him to focus his mer-senses upon her as much as possible. Having given herself as intimately as was yet possible to Mac with a second blow job, Bonnie\u0026rsquo;s internal struggle with her gender change had evaporated. Not only could she feel her connection to Mac, Joy, and Annette grow throughout the day but also her desire to truly to be the perfect mermaid-mate to all three of them.\nShe was going to be a mermaid! She also marveled at how her love for\u0026ndash; and from\u0026ndash;Annette felt more powerful and needful than ever before. Throughout the day Annette stayed by her side, celebrating each change as they noticed them. Annette also teased Bonnie when she was caught drooling over the chiseled outline of Mac\u0026rsquo;s pecs, ogling the dimples at the top of her own ass, or losing herself in the amazing kaleidoscope of hazel, brown, gold, and black that were Joy\u0026rsquo;s new eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;So, what are you thinking?\u0026rdquo; Bonnie asked Mac as she stroked his mid-tail fins, watching them twitch as she tickled them. Her belly was full from their third feeding, and she could feel the siren cells move throughout her body.\n\u0026ldquo;Your body,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m working hard.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; she said, looking across Mac\u0026rsquo;s tail to where Annette and Joy sat entwined in a gentle, but thorough hug. \u0026ldquo;I can feel it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Still a pressure?\u0026rdquo; asked Annette.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said. \u0026ldquo;More like a slow, internal massage now. It\u0026rsquo;s like I can almost feel the siren cells moving around inside me, moving stuff around. I\u0026rsquo;m probably imagining it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe not,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not changing as dramatically as you are, my love, but I can still feel the effects. It does feel like something moving within me, but gently, not intrusively.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, exactly,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said. She closed her eyes and tried to imagine what she would finally look like. The earlier description made sense to her, Annette\u0026rsquo;s dramatic curves, and Joy\u0026rsquo;s height, but she couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine her face. Her old face still adorned her visage, and she could not banish it from her imagination. \u0026ldquo;What will my face look like?\u0026rdquo; she asked, turning to look Mac in the eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Close your eyes,\u0026rdquo; he said. She did. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re already changing, you know. Remember those Vargas pinups from our youth?\u0026rdquo; She nodded, a smile creeping across her lips. \u0026ldquo;Remember how the brunettes all seemed to have a more knowing look than the blonds or redheads?\u0026rdquo; She nodded again, noticing that her hair fell in front of her face for the first time as she did. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the look,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s sort of a mishmash in my mind, but you get the picture.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That will work for me,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said, seeing the image in her mind\u0026rsquo;s eye.\n\u0026ldquo;Me too,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;Especially since we\u0026rsquo;re all going to be brunettes anyway.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uuhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie moaned, putting a hand on her lower abdomen.\n\u0026ldquo;You alright?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked. \u0026ldquo;Should I stop?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said, grimacing. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s my hips, they hurt.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Water,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s all get in the water and get the weight off of Bonnie\u0026rsquo;s bones. This happened with all the other mermaids who were men.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to move,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said. \u0026ldquo;Just let me be. It will be fine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;re just too stubborn for your own good,\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re getting in the water now. You should also take off those clothes. They aren\u0026rsquo;t going to fit in a little while.\u0026rdquo;\nBonnie shot her wife an irritated glance, \u0026ldquo;That is exactly why I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to go into the water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, come on,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been naked for the past few days. You might as well get used to it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnnette untangled herself from Joy and stood up, crossed to Bonnie and held out a hand. \u0026ldquo;Come on, upsie-daisy.\u0026rdquo;\nBonne got on all fours, and everyone could see the change in her hips, they were getting wider. She reached for Annette\u0026rsquo;s hand slowly drew herself up. She stepped back from Annette, looked at the tall, glass wall she was going to have to climb, and sighed.\n\u0026ldquo;Clothes,\u0026rdquo; Annette said as she shucked her own.\nBonnie pulled her shirt over her head and dropped it, and then released the belt on her pants, which she could clearly see no longer fit. She looked up and suddenly noticed that all eyes were upon her. She looked down at herself, and noted the changes everyone could see now that she was naked from the hips up. Her waist had risen and shrunk in diameter, her hips were wider, though in a boyish way, and her nipples were now peaked, little domes on her otherwise flat chest. Her body hair was largely gone, and her fingers and feet looked smaller and thinner. She fumbled with the catch, but when her pants were undone, she ran her fingers along the top of her pants, feeling frisky. Despite her pain, she turned around, pushing her changing ass towards the others. She wiggled her hips as she pushed the pants and boxer shorts down and then stepped out of them, naked.\n\u0026ldquo;Ta Daaaa,\u0026rdquo; she said as she twirled back around.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my,\u0026rdquo; Annette said.\nBonnie\u0026rsquo;s hands flew to her crotch and chest, feeling suddenly embarrassed.\n\u0026ldquo;No, no!\u0026rdquo; Annette said. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re beautiful.\u0026rdquo; She crossed to her husband and took Bonnie\u0026rsquo;s arms away from her changing body. \u0026ldquo;Like a teenage girl \u0026hellip; with short hair \u0026hellip; and a crooked nose.\u0026rdquo; She gave Bonnie a playful kiss on her nose. \u0026ldquo;Now, up and over you go.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wait a sec,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, salamandering over to the edge of the tank and he coiling his tail underneath him. He waited for Joy to do the same, and then he grabbed hold of her hips. She nodded, and he heaved her upwards as she pushed up with her tail. She easily reached the top of the tank and in a continuous motion, pulled her hips up over her shoulders in a perfect pike position and then rolled forward into the water with a splash. A second later, Mac did the same thing.\n\u0026ldquo;You can stop drooling over how strong he is,\u0026rdquo; Annette teased. \u0026ldquo;You go first,\u0026rdquo; she waved to the ladder that now leaned against the glass wall on the far side of the room. She watched Bonnie ascend the ladder slowly and somewhat painfully and then tumble into the water, and then she followed.\nMac caught Bonnie in his embrace, effortlessly holding both their heads above the water, his pelvic and mid-tail fins waving back and forth, his flukes nearly still. Joy did the same thing for Annette. After a few moments of silence, Bonnie spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;You were right. This does help.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Mac, give her your full attention!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said, \u0026ldquo;Change me!\u0026rdquo;\nThe next morning, the mers and humans gathered on the beach once again. Pat watched as Torro emerged from the jungle, Maja and Antonia helping him as he walked on unsteady and weakened legs. He was having some difficulties in recovering from the effects of several days of mermaid venom, and now that they understood his story more fully, everyone seemed to take a liking to the troubled young man. He was still Malaki\u0026rsquo;s son, but he was as much a victim as anyone else. The two teen-aged girls were surprisingly strong and resilient, Pat thought, as she watched them mother Torro. She wondered if that was the start of a pod.\nShe turned to watch Harold Mathews and Michael Thompson drag Malaki down to the center of the gathering mers and humans. He was now actively struggling against his bonds and cursing his captors in a steady stream of invectives in at least three or four languages. Neither Harold nor Michael seemed to show any great concern for either Malaki\u0026rsquo;s comfort or his curses. Michael casually brought out the gag Malaki had worn the previous evening, and on Malaki\u0026rsquo;s next fuck you, he slipped it over the smaller man\u0026rsquo;s head. Pat smiled as Malaki\u0026rsquo;s next string of invectives was lost in the gag as Michael tightened it firmly.\nShe looked over again at Torro and wondered why he seemed to be having such a hard time recovering when his father seemed nearly completely recovered. She watched as the two girls gently guided Torro down to the sand, seeing how he reveled in the attention. Ah, Torro \u0026hellip; not such a difficult explanation as to his medical state. Pat smiled; Torro could probably use some positive attention, but she called Bridget over to join her. She watched as both Maja and Antonia fussed over Torro, surprising her by how innocent the three of them seemed. There didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be any sexual tension among them. Torro wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a bad looking young man, slight though he was, and Maja and Antonia were both beauties, despite the wear and tear each of them wore in their eyes. Strange, she thought to herself.\n\u0026ldquo;I would love to be certain that Torro\u0026rsquo;s recovery is delayed only by his desire for attention,\u0026rdquo; she said to Bridget as her sister drew near. \u0026ldquo;See if you can make sure he\u0026rsquo;s actually doing alright without embarrassing him in front of his new friends.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You got it, Sis,\u0026rdquo; Bridget said, waving Elise to join her. The two of them salamandered over to Torro and the teenagers and started talking to them.\nPat then noticed Emma and the Basras all leaving from the same hut. All four of them seemed to have recovered dramatically over night. Even in clothing that wasn\u0026rsquo;t their own, each seemed more confident than they had the previous evening. Even Sudhish, whom Pat had thought would take days or weeks to pull himself out of morning for his sister, seemed to be smiling and happy. There was a closeness among Emma, Rani, and Vidya that seemed different from the previous day. She studied Sudhish, fearful that he was thinking of becoming the pod-leader for his own sisters. No, he wasn\u0026rsquo;t sending any of those vibes, she decided. She\u0026rsquo;d find out after they let Malaki have his say.\nShe glanced back to check in on Danni, Liga, Petra who were currently wrangling the children. The three of them were relaxing in the surf, their tails facing the open sea, watching the children as they tumbled and frolicked in the shallow water. Maureen had fed strongly this morning, Pat mused, and she could still feel her nipples throb. Her daughter was only two months old, but she was already acting like a two or three year old human. Maureen and her sisters were babbling words and nonsense nearly non-stop, swimming and salamandering nearly everywhere, and eating like horses. Pat looked back a Malaki, and thought how much of a danger he, and so many others, might pose to her daughters. She sighed, resigned to the wisdom and primal justice of simply protecting the ones you love. Malaki showed no signs of reforming, and unlike Liga, it was not likely to be easy to change him into a loving mermaid.\nShe squared her shoulders and salamadered over to where Malaki lay trussed up in a sitting position on the sand. She looked down at him, her eyes only eight centimeters higher than his, mind you, but it was eight centimeters, and asked, \u0026ldquo;Are you ready to be questioned?\u0026rdquo; Malaki let loose another muffled string of curses, and Pat waited for him to finish. \u0026ldquo;Well, we\u0026rsquo;ll give it a shot regardless.\u0026rdquo; She reached behind him and untied the gag, letting it fall to the sand.\n\u0026ldquo;You slimey manggagaway!\u0026rdquo; Malaki roared now that he could. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll see you roast in hellfire before I answer any of your questions.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A witch am I?\u0026rdquo; Pat said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;Ironic, but I guess it\u0026rsquo;s o.k. since I invented the goop that changed your sons into dolphins. You can call me a witch.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a whorish sirena without a soul,\u0026rdquo; Malaki continued. \u0026ldquo;Bruha! Pokpok!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sticks and stones,\u0026rdquo; said Pat brightly. \u0026ldquo;Just let me know when you\u0026rsquo;re ready.\u0026rdquo;\nMalaki kept up a steady and creative stream of curses and sexual assaults for the next ten minutes. Pat simply smiled and let him rant and rave, marveling at Malaki\u0026rsquo;s capacity for anger and name-calling. When he finally stopped, she waited a full minute, daring him to start back up.\n\u0026ldquo;Malaki Dimaunahan, you have been accused of murder, extortion, prostitution, drug trafficking, bribery, and crimes against humanity,\u0026rdquo; Pat said with an official voice. \u0026ldquo;How do you plead?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Putanginamo!\u0026rdquo; he spat.\n\u0026ldquo;A fuck you in any language is still a fuck you,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;John?\u0026rdquo;\nJohn salamandered over and reinserted the gag as Malaki protested loudly. When he was finished, he gave Malaki an energetic thump on the back that nearly knocked him over and said, \u0026ldquo;Well played, asshole.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In the absence of any reasonable testimony from the accused, can we agree to let yesterday\u0026rsquo;s accounts from Emma, Sudhish, Rani, Vidya, Maja, Antonia, and Torro stand?\u0026rdquo; she asked the throng. Everyone gave his or her assent.\n\u0026ldquo;What should be his punishment?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked. After a moment of awkward and heavy silence, Emma finally said, \u0026ldquo;Death.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Unfortunately, we don\u0026rsquo;t have any hemlock handy,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;So, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to decide how we are to do this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Torro said. \u0026ldquo;Do not kill him. I wish to honor my mother.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do you wish to do that?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked. \u0026ldquo;Wait, YOU don\u0026rsquo;t want to kill him?\u0026rdquo;\nTorro stood up, showing a remarkable recovery from the mermaid venom in the last few minutes. He walked over to his bound and gagged father, squatting before him. His father met his gaze with unabashed hatred. He looked into Malaki\u0026rsquo;s eyes for several seconds before turning away.\n\u0026ldquo;I think his greatest fear is to no longer be a man,\u0026rdquo; Torro began. \u0026ldquo;A man as he understands such a thing to be. I think that his version of a man is an abomination, and I have no wish to continue to be my father\u0026rsquo;s son. My father should be punished, yes. But first, he should witness his only remaining son become a woman, and then a mermaid. The last of his line will disappear from the face of the earth, and my mother will be remembered in my new form. I want this vision to torment him for the rest of his life.\u0026rdquo;\nPat took a deep breath. She had underestimated this young man, and she saw how elegantly Torro met both the need to escape from and to punish his father in this course of action. She salamandered over to him and took his hand.\n\u0026ldquo;Justice guided by love,\u0026rdquo; she said, giving him a squeeze. \u0026ldquo;Welcome to our Island, Torro.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Please, no longer am I his son,\u0026rdquo; he answered. \u0026ldquo;Please call me Valencia. That was my mother\u0026rsquo;s name.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Welcome, Valencia,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\nThere was a pause as the two of them simply looked at one another, and then they realized that something had changed. Both the mermaid and the boy turned to look at Malaki, who was both silent and still for the first time that morning. His eyes were wide with shock, wonder, and horror as he stared at his son.\n\u0026ldquo;Good for you, Valencia,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;You finally got him to shut up.\u0026rdquo;\nThe past two and a half days had brought about dramatic changes on Taylor\u0026rsquo;s Island, the Baker homestead. In the house above, Jack had completed the paperwork to hand over the title and deed to his land to the MMI.\nHe and Kyle had assembled a list of six people who added essential skills or knowledge bases to the mer population and who were willing to embark upon an adventure with precious few details other than the promise of vitality and a fresh start. They had just finished up the last of the paperwork as dusk settled over the island and were headed down to the tank.\nIn the tank below, Annette and Bonnie had fully revitalized to their midtwenties, developed gills, and had webbing up to their second knuckles. As they stood in front of the tank wall, naked, they compared themselves in their reflections in the glass. Annette was fully restored to her blond bombshell status, a petite and curvy woman with generous hips and slender shoulders.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yup. Liv Lindeland,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said as he and Jackson entered and took in the scene.\n\u0026ldquo;I can see it now,\u0026rdquo; Jack agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Annette is far prettier than that old hag,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, his chin resting on his hands at the top of the glass wall.\n\u0026ldquo;What about me?\u0026rdquo; Bonnie asked into the reflection in the glass wall. \u0026ldquo;Who do I look like?\u0026rdquo;\nThe two men looked at the dramatic beauty into which the former navy man had been transformed. Bonnie\u0026rsquo;s long legs were both graceful and powerful, and they supported a lovely heart-shaped ass that was neither too wide nor too narrow. Her waist was dramatically smaller, however, which made her hips look wider than they were. Above her small waist hung two perfect breasts, which would have done a bullet bra justice. Her face had a strong chin, elegant neck, generous smile, large expressive eyes, dramatically arched eyebrows, and a thick mane of curly brown hair.\n\u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t rightly say,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said, adjusting his pants.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s like a pin up right out of memory,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\n\u0026ldquo;She reminds me of Irish McCalla,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll bet that was a favorite of yours when you were a kid,\u0026rdquo; she said to Mac.\n\u0026ldquo;Now that you mention it,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, appraising the beauty below.\n\u0026ldquo;Sheena of the Sea! I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I should be jealous or madly in love,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, looking over her former husband.\n\u0026ldquo;Please choose B,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said, her voice dripping with the promise of pleasure.\n\u0026ldquo;We better get you two in the tank before Jack and Kyle have a meltdown,\u0026rdquo; Joy said from her perch on the top of the glass wall.\nBonnie looked over her shoulder, giving the two men a very knowing and deliberate Lauren Bacall look.\n\u0026ldquo;You boys need anything?\u0026rdquo; she asked. Both men just shook their heads, not trusting their voices.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then, if you are ready my dear,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie motioned to Annette that she could climb the ladder first.\nJoy gracefully slipped back into the tank as the two girls climbed in after her. Kyle and Jack both felt the sexual tension in the room dissipate, and they shared a grin of embarrassment. They watched both girls feed from first Joy and then Mac. After they shared the fruits of Mac\u0026rsquo;s enormous orgasm, they both grew stiff and assumed the transformational position. Bubbles started to roil around them.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s that?\u0026rdquo; Kyle asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Mac and Joy, they\u0026rsquo;re humming,\u0026rdquo; Jack answered, transfixed by the beauty and power of the scene before him.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said, looking at the skylight above. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not humming.\u0026rdquo;\nJack looked up as well. The evening sky was clear and bright in the skylights several stories above their heads. The slowly growing sound of helicopter blades beating the air broke the sound of soft, harmonic humming.\n\u0026ldquo;That sounds close,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said.\n\u0026ldquo;Too close,\u0026rdquo; Jack growled. He glanced over at the tank. The mers and proto-mers were all spinning gracefully in the center of the tank, and the fish were performing their usual merry-go-round accompaniment. They were oblivious, and he was going to do whatever it took to keep it that way.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you think we should do?\u0026rdquo; Kyle asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, but I don\u0026rsquo;t like it,\u0026rdquo; Jack said as he walked over to a wall panel near the pump room. He opened a panel and flipped down a computer screen and keyboard. He waited for the computer to boot up as they both listened to the choppers get closer and closer. They could now hear the faint whine of marine motors.\n\u0026ldquo;They got boats too,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said. \u0026ldquo;This is big.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seems so,\u0026rdquo; Jack agreed, focused on the computer screen. It finally loaded, and his fingers flew over the keyboard. After a few seconds, a Homeland Security page appeared and asked for a password. Jack typed one in, and hit enter. Another page loaded, and he scrolled down and entered a code in one of the search bars. A new page loaded, and he scrolled down the list that appeared.\n\u0026ldquo;Dang it,\u0026rdquo; Jack said, as though he had forgotten bread at the grocery store. \u0026ldquo;I shoulda known.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Shoulda known what?\u0026rdquo; Kyle asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I should have been more circumspect in contacting the MMI,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\n\u0026ldquo;Hows that?\u0026rdquo; Kyle asked.\n\u0026ldquo;A multi-million dollar transfer of assets and property to an multinational entity,\u0026rdquo; Jack said, closing that window and opening another. \u0026ldquo;Done by a man who has a national security clearance and a past relationship with the CIA.\u0026rdquo; He entered another set of passwords into a new screen and waited for it to load. \u0026ldquo;Probably should have thought that one out more.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yup,\u0026rdquo; Kyle agreed, peering over his shoulder trying to see what Jack was doing. \u0026ldquo;Spilt milk, I suppose.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yup,\u0026rdquo; Jack agreed. He glanced over his shoulder at the tank. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell if Annette and Bonnie were progressing faster, but he knew that they were going to take longer than he likely had. The computer chirped, and he turned to look at the screen. A video display showed four views from the house along each of the cardinal directions. Nothing showed in the screens until Jack\u0026rsquo;s fingers flew over the keys, altering the filters on the cameras. As the green tinted images came into focus, they could see two military grade helicopters with no marking and two naval river patrol boats without marking, coming in from the west.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not good,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said, seeing the video.\n\u0026ldquo;Seal it off, and don\u0026rsquo;t let anyone in unless it\u0026rsquo;s me,\u0026rdquo; Jack said as he turned away from the computer and headed for the passageway up to the house.\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; Kyle stopped him. \u0026ldquo;If this is as bad as it looks, then you are more likely to get me out of a jam that I am to help you. I should go up there. I\u0026rsquo;ll say that I\u0026rsquo;m just watching the place until you get back. I\u0026rsquo;m just a local, and I can play the dumb card for a good long while. They can try to tear this place apart, and eventually they\u0026rsquo;ll get tired.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Annette isn\u0026rsquo;t the only person who knows about this tank,\u0026rdquo; Jack said heavily. \u0026ldquo;Some one will know about it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but it will take several days to pry the place open if you seal it up,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said. \u0026ldquo;Right? That\u0026rsquo;s the way you designed this darn place.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You sure?\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;You might be risking \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Damn sure,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said. \u0026ldquo;Just don\u0026rsquo;t let me rot in some cell for very long.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;Well \u0026hellip; um \u0026hellip; \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;None of that,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said, brushing past him. \u0026ldquo;Just seal it up. I\u0026rsquo;ll see you in a bit.\u0026rdquo; He turned to go.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;You probably have a few minutes; destroy and shred as much paper work as you can, but don\u0026rsquo;t wait too long, so as you don\u0026rsquo;t look like you were doing it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, yup,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said. He marched out of the room and up the passageway and then into the basement of the house.\nAs soon as the indicator light showed that the basement door was secure, Jack returned to the computer and brought up a new screen. He entered a user-name and password, and then started to select a series of options from a long list of radial buttons. He brought the video screen back to the front, calculated how much time he had, and then returned to the other screen, scrolled to the bottom of the page and selected an override button. He scrolled through the long page, checking each of the options the computer had entered automatically. He sighed and hit \u0026ldquo;enter.\u0026rdquo;\nDeep within the pump room a series of hydraulic valves clicked open, allowing pressurized oil to feed into the reinforced hoses connected to those valves. After a moment, at the juncture of the ceiling and the bottom of the false chicken shed above, a nearly two foot thick slab of iron and concrete began inching across the opening. The top of the slab was covered in old hay and sawdust, dried chicken poop, and some rusting tools. A few seconds later, a thick iron door that needed no camouflage began sliding horizontally across the entrance to the passageway, sealing off that route.\nJack moved to his left and opened the panel that controlled the sea locks on the filter and access tunnels and flipped a switch, lowering two sets of iron gates, ones at the very end of the tunnels camouflaged to look like the rocks and mud of the bed of the bay, and a second set near the mid-points of each tunnel were simply iron bars that allowed the water to pass but nothing larger than a crab. When the indicator lights showed that the room was sealed, he returned to his computer and opened yet another window.\nHe entered another user-name and password, composed a short message, and then added several email addresses to the blind-copy-send field. He launched a tracer program and keyed it to the message, and then sent the message, watching the tracer program\u0026rsquo;s window track its progress. When he saw that the message had made it to the public server at the University of Maryland, he closed those programs, opened a new window, and logged onto his local network. He locked down all the computers in the house above in safe mode but left them running. He returned to the video feed and checked the progress of the approaching helicopters and boats. Satisfied there was nothing else he needed to do, he walked to the cot, sat down, and returned his attention to the majestic and beautiful vision of a double mermaid transformation.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/changes-in-paradise15/","tags":["mermaids","transgender","transformation"],"title":"Changes in Paradise: Part 15 - Camouflage, Connections, and Chesapeake"},{"categories":["Mermaids"],"contents":"Mac\u0026rsquo;s Pod on Taylor\u0026rsquo;s Island completes, the three \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; pods on Mermaid Island begin their changes, the world comes another step closer to discovering the mers.\nI used to be a man, Bonnie thought as her legs stiffened and her arms lifted away from her sides. She remembered a similar swirling of energy within her body when she started her change in gender a scant three days previously. Then, it started as a tiny tingle that grew more powerful, shifting her mental state so thoroughly that it surprised her even though she was ready for the change. Now, the changes were still surprising, and the feelings encompassed her entire body. If a Navy man had to become a woman, it\u0026rsquo;s best she be a mermaid, Bonnie thought with irony.\nShe felt frozen, her eyes locked with Annette\u0026rsquo;s, but sensing Joy and Mac as they hummed and stroked her body. Bonnie saw the spark of awareness in Annette\u0026rsquo;s immobile eyes, her mouth frozen in a post-sexual smile, and she imagined her own face looked quite similar. She knew her body was spinning, propelled by the shimmering embrace of thousands of tiny bubbles as the microorganisms began their work.\nAlthough unable to move her body, she felt every inch of it. The energy from Mac and Joy\u0026rsquo;s mer organs pressed on her like a heavy blanket, covering her entire body. There was a sweet eroticism in that pressure, knowing she was unable to resist their invisible touch. It seemed similar to the first moment when she capitulated in Mac\u0026rsquo;s embrace, feeling the power and control radiating from his body while it squeezed out from her own. Wrapped in his arms on the floor of the tank viewing room, the powerful energies overwhelmed and transformed her emotional and sexual feelings. Now, floating and spinning in the tank, the changes were merely physical.\nMerely, she thought with a silent laugh! The changes were stretching; almost pulling her legs, as they prepared to merge. Her hips were also stretching painfully, her pelvic passage opening wider so that one day she might carry a baby mermaid through to term. Slowly, her slim Vargas girl hips expanded closer to Annette\u0026rsquo;s generous proportions, but the wash of siren cells flowing through her body quickly overwhelmed the discomfort from her hips. Her already generous breasts expanded, the rising bubbles caressing her firm, round flesh as they flowed past her developing curves.\nShe had no sense of time passing. She only knew that her body kept changing. The pressure in her legs eased as the skin between them dissolved while her muscles wove themselves together in new configurations. A series of sharp, quick jabs of pain accompanied the shifting of her leg bones into the segmented, single limb of a mermaid. She couldn’t feel the new connections growing between her knees or ankles, only the blanket of pressure continuing as new fins pushed out from her elbows, hips, and former knees. Her feet began to spread out into the classic fantail flukes of a mermaid. In her lower torso, her womb expanded as her vaginal opening moved forward and a bit lower to the surface of her tail.\nAlthough she couldn’t look anywhere else other than Annette’s eyes, she sensed both her own and Annette’s hair growing longer. Her lover’s hair turned brown, like her own, she thought. Ripples of energy raced over her entire body as her skin cells transformed into chromatophores that would keep her hidden. Finally, a great spasm gripped her, an intensely pleasurable stab forcing her body into a backwards circle, her new flukes arching up behind her, quivering over her head. She blinked and her camouflage snapped on\u0026ndash;all over her body\u0026ndash;and finally, she relaxed in the water.\nHer mer-senses came on-line, like eyes growing used to light after a long period of blindness. It took a few seconds, before sensing her three pod-mates, as well as hundreds of fish sharing the tank, but she focused on the power and clarity of Annette’s, Joy’s, and Mac’s signals in those first moments. Her heart swelled as she plumbed the depths of this new connection, feeling the warm and colorful energy crackling through her entire body.\nShe looked down at her long tail, her new fins slowly brushing back in forth, her body’s autonomic systems keeping her steady and balanced. Her impressive breasts partially blocked her view, but because of her camouflage, they mostly looked like the bottom of the tank. She glanced up at Annette and recognized that while she could see her mate clearly, Annette’s skin was also broadcasting the fish, rocks, and fauna behind her in the tank.\nAs she looked at the shimmering beauty that Annette had become, Bonnie felt a new power wash over her and intense need rose up from her new womb. Heat flared up in both her chest and her tail as her bioluminescence flickered to life for the first time. Annette’s body responded as well, and they both turned towards Mac. Joy positioned herself along one of his fins and ran one hand along his magnificent cock. Annette swam over to the other fin, smiling at Bonnie, and pressing her own vent over Mac’s vibrating fin.\n“You’re technically the virgin here,” Annette said. “You should have the honor.”\nUnconsciously, Bonnie reacted to Mac’s powerful body, her fins pushing her towards him without thought. He reached out and guided her hips towards his, stopping her when his penis softly speared her still opening vent. He moved her hips in gentle circles, stimulating her body, sending her need higher and higher. Bonnie’s flukes caressed Mac’s lower tail, feeling overwhelmed by the sensuousness of the tactile perception of her flukes fluttering against something. Joy and Annette ran their fingers lightly along Bonnie’s shoulders, arms, elbow fins, and pelvic fins, sending additional thrills of energy across her twitching and quivering body. Bonnie grabbed Mac’s face and kissed him deeply, thrusting her tongue into his mouth, instinctively curling the ends of her flukes around his tail to bring her hips into his.\n“Uh, uh,” Mac said playfully. “Not yet,” he teased her, keeping her hips back but rotating them in smaller and smaller circles, keeping the head of his cock outside her vent.\nAs her need grew, Bonnie’s breasts filled with pressure. She pulled herself to Mac again, this time forcing the head of his penis into her canal before Mac could stop her. She growled and arched her hips towards him, forcing another inch inside her. The stretching felt wonderful and she wanted more, deeper, NOW.\nBut Mac was too strong. He kept her at bay, and started rotating her hips again. She cried out in frustration, but he silenced her with another kiss. She hungrily kissed him back, still struggling to force more of his cock inside her. She felt another inch slip in, and then she felt a tightness, a hitch in her canal. Her virginity. She really was a virgin!\nMac pulled his head back and looked down at their union. One either side of them, the two mermaids were leaking milk into the water, each building towards their own orgasms. Bonnie looked down as well, feeling three inches of mer cock inside her and seeing another seven or eight inches left to go. Her insides quivered at the thought of all of that moving into her.\n“Ready?” He asked, his eyes full of love and gentleness mixed with need and lust. Bonnie nodded, as her face was a mask of lust too.\nMac kept his hands on her hips and drew himself nearly out of her vent, then paused, their eyes locked. He waited a brief second and then pulled her hips forcefully, slamming into her with a thwack. All three mermaids vocalized in unison. Bonnie barked in pain, which quickly dissolved into passionate moans while Annette and Joy grunted as Mac’s fins vibrated sharply in their vents. Mac pulled out slowly and slammed back in, Bonnie moaning deep in her throat, feeling every inch as it slipped out and then slammed back into her. Mac’s rhythm increased steadily until her breasts let down and milk began pouring from her nipples. Bonnie vocalized constantly and could both see and sense the bioluminescence race across all four of them. Bonnie never felt anything so consuming and passionate in her life. Joy erupted first, grunting out her orgasm, jerking with each individual spasm. Annette was next, her orgasm rolling over her in continuous waves, her body quivering like a tuning fork.\n“Yesssssss,” Mac groaned as he gushed into Bonnie, feeling each pulse racing up his penis and unleashing itself within her new vagina.\nMac’s first hot splash deep inside her body surprised Bonnie. A mermaid could feel something that deep inside her! Then her own orgasm erupted, her body going rigid as Mac stroked in and out a few more times, sending pulses of semen into her tight, tense body. On his third stroke, an enormous spike of pleasure turned her body into jelly, and she collapsed onto Mac, her womb throbbing and thumping as the rest of her flailed limply. Mac pressed his body to hers, and her throbbing vent squeezed out one more pulse from his cock.\nIt took many minutes before Bonnie could recover, and when she did, she discovered herself still impaled on a rigid and ready merman’s cock.\n“My turn, my dear,” Annette said, pushing gently at Bonnie’s hips, causing Mac to slip out of her vent.\n“Yes, my love,” Bonnie said, barely able to move of her own accord.\nJack divided his time between the video feeds from his computer and the amazing sight of the transformation of the two mermaids. A few minutes after the transformation began, he watched the helicopters hover and disgorge a group of commandos, and swarm over his island, little blobs of green pulsating on his computer screen. They surrounded the house and outbuildings while one of the two boats pulled up to the northeast side of the island where another group of commandos jumped from the boat into the bay. They scrambled up the grassy shoreline a few moments later and fanned out, forming a perimeter along that side of the island. At the same time, the other boat pulled alongside The Slipper and vomited more commandos who swarmed up the dock, fanning out to form a similar perimeter on the other side of the island and surrounding anyone in the house or outbuildings, cutting them off from any escape.\nUnless they could swim out a tunnel, of course.\nThe audio and video feeds hidden around his island tracked the progress of the raid. Kyle walked outside as soon as the troops dropped from the sky and immediately lay down on the ground, his hands outstretched over his head. Three men grabbed him quickly and cuffed, frisked, and then hustled him down to the boat at the dock. Jack had no idea what they were saying, but he hoped that Kyle was doing fine. More than that, he hoped Kyle shredded most of their notes from the last two days. He didn’t want any of their potential recruits to get sucked into this mess.\nIn the meantime, the black-clad commandos continued to swarm over the entire island and into every room of his house. The basement passway to his hidden, underground tank remained undiscovered, but Jack knew that wouldn’t last forever. The helicopters flew away, presumably returning to whence they had come, probably Quantico, Jack thought. The men then began a more thorough and methodical search of the island, the outbuildings, his house, and its furnishings and effects.\nHe cringed when he saw his computers and other equipment, including the short wave radio with the dial still set to its last frequency, hauled out to the military boats. Two more boats arrived while the search continued. One was a similar looking military boat while the other looked like a civilian yacht, but Jack knew better.\nAfter a short while, the three military boats took on all of the commandos and departed, presumably with Kyle still aboard. Seven men left the yacht, all of them in overcoats and carrying black cases of various shapes and sizes. Jack smiled, the screen on his computer looking very much like a bad action movie. Sometimes the spooks acted exactly as Hollywood expected. The men marched up to the house and began unpacking their equipment.\nJack opened yet another screen on his computer, got past his own security, and then initiated a series of protocols making most of their electronic gadgetry useless, overwhelmed by countless sources of electronic emissions, 90% of them bogus, buried in nearly every nook and cranny of the house and island. There was a slight hitch in the lights in the tank viewing room as the protocol initiated, but so slight that the men in his house did not see it.\nAs night gave way to morning, the men above kept up with their fruitless scans of the island. They knew something was here, but with so many of their devices overwhelmed by so many false sources, they had resorted to old-fashioned searching. They went from room-to-room, tapping and knocking on walls, floors, and furniture. Jackson wished he had installed some sort of active defense on his island, sleeping gas or something.\nHowever, his interest and attention was mostly on the tank, watching the two newest mers blossom within the veil of bubbles roiling around them. As dawn approached, the two new mers winked out of view. They then provided the most spectacular, and erotic, light show Jack had ever seen. A light show repeated, with changing partners, three times. It was nearly 9 AM in the morning before the mers snapped back into view, their heads and hands lined along the top of the glass wall of the tank.\n“Got any food?” Mac asked.\nJack nodded and went into the storeroom, returning with a case of MRE’s.\n“Perfect,” Mac said. “I love military food.”\n“I hate military food,” Bonnie said, taking one of the packages anyway.\n“What’s with the ceiling?” Joy asked as she ripped open the mylar bag of her MRE.\n“We have visitors,” Jack said. “They took Kyle, all my computers, the radio, everything.”\n“A family matter?” Asked Annette her new voice silvery and shimmering like Joy’s voice.\n“Unusual for the Company to act against a domestic target,” Jack said. “I can’t be sure, but it has a military feel to it.”\n“With your estate donated to the MMI, might that make you a non-domestic target?” Annette asked.\n“No,” Jack answered. “The MMI is legally based out of San Francisco, which despite what some conservatives think, is still part of the US.”\n“What’s the status?” Mac asked, looking up at the thick slab above their heads.\n“We are sealed in, for the moment,” Jack said, walking over to the wall console. “There are seven men topside. I’ve rendered their electronic surveillance and search devices useless. They are currently moving room-to-room searching by hand.”\n“Estimate?” Mac asked.\n“Later today or tonight, maybe,” Jack said. “If they find the passageway, they won’t gain access. It would take a bunker bomb to open this place up, and they can’t risk one of those in the middle of the Chesapeake.”\n“Recommendations?” Mac asked.\n“We wait,” Jack said. “I’ve asked some friends for help, including Mr. Kolbert, which I hope was adequate warning to him that the game’s afoot.”\n“I hate waiting more than Bonnie hates military food,” Joy said, watching her new sister-wife grimace as she choked down her food.\n“He says he won’t eat,” Bridget reported. “I suppose this is his way of taking control of the situation.”\n“How long will he stay alive if he is successful?” Pat asked.\n“Depends on how much water he drinks,” Bridget said, drawing on her pod’s medical knowledge gained thanks to mer bonding. “Without water, in this heat, he wouldn’t last more than three or four days. With water and without food, I’d say about four or five weeks. But I don’t think he can do it. He seemed unable to resist food and water on the boat.”\n“Well, we can force him to drink water,” Pat observed. “So that Valencia’s wishes that Malaki should be witness to her transformation can be fulfilled.”\n“Yes, that’s easy, even without fancy medical equipment,” Bridget said. She turned towards Malaki’s hut, took a few tentative salamander steps in that direction and then looked back over her shoulder. “You know, he really is a nasty little man.”\n“I know,” Pat said.\n“I probably wouldn’t have said this a year ago, but we really are doing the right thing,” Bridget said.\n“Thanks, sis,” Pat said, moved. “That means a lot to me, actually.”\nPat watched her sister salamander out of the shallow water, back up the beach, and into the small hut where Malaki was a prisoner. A moment after she entered, a colorful and creative stream of swear words and curses competed with the sounds of the gentle surf in which Pat rested. The sound of someone gagging on water choked off a particularly loud curse, followed by more coughing, then by more curses, then followed again shortly with another fit of gagging and coughing, and so on.\nPat smiled and shook her head at the man’s stubbornness. She looked down the beach towards the southern arm of the lagoon where MuSu’s pod lay gathered around Emma senior and the Basras. Pat saw Emma explaining something to her mother, perhaps the mechanics of mer transformations and changing genders. Pat’s heart fluttered a bit as she remembered the separation she and Danni endured to get Gabriel’s pod started. Ah, Michael, she thought, he was a good man, but now Gabriel was an excellent leader to his pod. Three tiny mermaid tails fluttering across her own as her pod’s daughters swam over and around her tail interrupted her musings.\n“Come here, you!” she cried as she reached for Maureen.\nHer daughter wriggled away from her grasp, and Pat’s mer organs sensed the giggles erupting from the tiny mermaid. Freya popped up out of the water and flipped onto Pat’s lap. She looked up at Pat with toddler eyes, shining with mischief and excitement, her Shirley Temple curls bouncing around her angelic face. She made a face at her aunt, and then flipped back into the water to chase her sisters. Pat felt a tug on her fluke fringes and scooped up little Cynthia who was trying to tickle her pod-mother.\n“What have we said about pulling on fringes?” Pat asked with a playful but serious tone.\nCynthia, now cradled in the bowl created by Pat’s curled flukes, made a play to pull on Pat’s fringes again.\n“Uh, uhhh, no pulling,” Pat said, flipping the little mermaid up into the air and back into the water.\nThe little mermaid squealed with delight as she splashed back into the surf. Pat couldn’t help laughing at the little squirmer’s antics. A second later, Phoebe, Danni, and John surfaced just beyond the breakers. All three little mermaids made a beeline for their father.\n“I feel someone tickling me,” John said. “I wonder who it could be?”\n“Three guesses,” Pat said, admiring her handsome mate.\n“Here, give this to the babysitter,” John said, handing a bag of collected food to Phoebe. He smiled and then ducked under the water to play with his children.\nPhoebe and Danni glided up to Pat and then flipped over and sat on either side of her, the three mermaids all facing the sea. Phoebe handed Pat the bag having an assortment of oysters, sea grasses, and one small bonefish.\n“We’ve already eaten,” Phoebe said. “You enjoy.”\n“Thanks,” she said, opening the bag and nevertheless sharing a few of the oysters.\nThe three ate in silence, listening to the wind, surf, and the occasional coughing fits from Malaki. The early morning sun sparkled and danced on the lagoon’s gentle waves, a calm occasionally broken by the eruption of a tiny mermaid arcing across the surface, trying to avoid her father’s tickling. The three mermaid mothers finished eating and unconsciously assumed the same position, their arms behind their torsos, their tails stretching into the shallow surf, their long hair cascading down their back, the long ends floating hydrophobically on the surface, their tiaras flashing in the morning sun, while the surf sparkled and danced gently all around them.\n“Does it bother you that we have to constantly forage for our food?” Danni asked.\n“No,” Pat said.\n“Don’t you miss tables, knives and forks, cooked food, and waiters?” she persisted.\nPat thought for a moment. “Sometimes, but fresh food is really good, and there’s something honest about catching it yourself.”\n“Or having your pod-mate catch it for you,” Phoebe said.\n“Will we ever farm the ocean?” Danni asked.\n“Eventually,” Pat said.\n“Really?” Danni asked.\n“There’s going to be nine or ten billion people on the planet pretty soon, and unless we develop a sustainable way to farm and trade with the landlubbers, we mers are going to be in trouble,” Pat said.\n“I don’t want to be a farmer,” Danni said.\n“No one will make you be a farmer,” Pat said, smiling.\n“I’m just saying,” Danni said, pulling a lock of her hair forward and twirling it in her fingers. “I won’t be a farmer.”\n“I think we can find people who do,” Pat laughed. “What do you want to do?”\n“Love you guys,” Danni answered. “It’s a lot of work to love a couple of scientists. You work late, leave me with the kids a lot, and then there’s John to keep happy.”\n“So, where exactly is the hard work part,” Pat asked. “Oh, nevermind,” she said seeing Danni’s smirk. She turned to Phoebe. “When do you think Alexis and Galina will be done testing the samples that Harold collected from the hot tub this morning?”\n“Probably not too much longer,” Phoebe answered. “While we wait, why don’t we join John and the children?”\nPat tossed the empty collection bag on the sand behind her and then doubled forward and sprang into the waves.\n“I’ll take that as a yes,” Phoebe said as she swung her tail behind her and wriggled herself into deeper water, Danni right behind her. Soon, the entire family was cavorting in the sparkling waters of the lagoon.\nBart Kolbert rubbed his chin as he read the email from Jackson Baker, his eyes narrowing as he read the message. He pushed himself back from his desk, laced his fingers behind his head, craned his head back to look at his favorite thinking spot on the ceiling, and let out a loud sigh. For a man he had known only a few days, Mr. Baker was making his life far more interesting than was desirable.\n“What’s up boss?” his secretary asked from the next room.\n“In a minute, Lucia,” he said, keeping his attention fixed to the ceiling. He glanced back towards the laptop on his desk, confirming that the email was, in fact, real, and yes, he had read it correctly. He returned to his study of the ceiling. After a few moments, he closed his eyes.\n“We’re going to need to make some calls,” he said loud enough for Lucia to hear him. “We have a problem.”\n“Don’t we always have a problem,” she responded, walking into the room.\nLucia Washington was a short, energetic, young woman with dark, flashing eyes and a toothy smile. Her mixed African-Anglo-Mexican heritage was visible in her generous lips and short, curly dark hair, which hung in ringlets about her face. She was working her way through college, taking night classes at the local community college, and Bart hoped she would one day achieve her dream of going to law school.\n“That’s why people get lawyers,” she said.\n“What’s the status of that special order we put together the other day?” he asked.\nLucia took out her smart phone and opened an app. When it launched, she entered an authorization code and then waited. She looked up at Bart. “It shipped today. Is that the problem? We sort of fudged the dates on the bill of lading for that.”\n“Nah … it might be, but I don’t think so,” he said. “It’s going out by air right now and then by ship?”\n“Yes, should be in Tuvalu in a few hours, and man, that cost us some serious cash,” she said.\nShe looked back down at her app. “An agent will pick it up at Funafuti International Airport and then take it to the MMI by tramp cargo. It should get there late today or early tomorrow, depending on weather.”\n“It’s tomorrow there already,” he said.\n“Oh, yea,” she said. “I forgot. Well, it should be there in 6 to 10 hours from now; will that work for you?”\n“Lucia, how long have you worked for me?” Bart asked, sitting up and facing her.\n“Three years,” she answered.\n“You know about our confidentiality requirements, of course,” he said.\n“Yes, of course,” she answered.\n“Yes, you do,” he said, rubbing his chin again. “You’ve been one of my best executive assistants, if not the best one I’ve ever had.”\n“Thank you, sir. I do my best,” she answered, sitting slowly in the chair facing him across the desk. “This sounds like a very big problem.”\n“Yes,” he sighed. “I might be brought in for questioning.”\n“Oh, no!” she said, straightening up. “That shipment wasn’t illegal, was it?”\n“No, it wasn’t. But I won’t be brought in because of something I’ve done that’s illegal,” he reassured her. “I’m pretty sure that I’m not personally in trouble. However, the work that we’ve been doing on the Marine Mammals Institute has hit the radar of some of the security agencies for the Federal Government.”\n“Why would Homeland Security care about dolphins?” Lucia said.\n“Actually, they have no idea what they are dealing with, and neither do you. It’s time I told you the truth about the MMI,” he said. “When I’m done, you will tell no one except the people whom I authorize to discuss these details, and if I am taken in for questioning, you will contact these people immediately. Do you understand?”\n“Yes, sir,” she answered. “What is the problem with MMI?”\n“How do you feel about mermaids?” he asked.\n“Mermaids, sir?” she asked.\n“Mermaids, yes,” he said. “You know, stuff like this,” he pulled out a copy of News of The World from his desk.\nThe supermarket tabloid showed lurid pictures of pop stars on the beach or drunkenly leaving clubs and claims of alien abduction. In the bottom right hand corner was the headline, “Mermaids kidnap prostitutes!” There was a picture of an elderly Filipino woman pointing towards a commercial looking house with a dock out the back.\n“Mermaid and alien abductions! Yeah, right. Where, exactly, are you going with this, sir?” she asked, looking at him as though he had suddenly sprouted a second head.\n“What if I told you that mermaids were the marine mammals that the institute was actually for?” he asked.\n“Are you crazy?” she asked. “I mean, that’s crazy. Mermaids. Shit, mermaids. Wait … you’re serious, aren’t you?”\n“Very,” he said, folding his hands on his desk. “Real, live, honest-toGod -mermaids. In fact, although few people know it, this story is actually true, but they didn’t kidnap the prostitutes, they rescued them.”\nHe pushed the tabloid across his desk to his stunned assistant. She looked at the picture and then the text next to it, and then back at him.\n“Fuck!” she said softly. “Shit, oops, sorry. I mean … seriously? Mermaids?”\n“Like a heart attack,” he answered.\nShe looked at him for several seconds, searching for the clue that he was kidding. “No kidding, for-real mermaids?”\n“For real,” he said.\nShe looked at the tabloid, and then back at him.\n“You mean some of this stuff is true?” she asked. “Like, Men In Black was for real?”\n“Alien stories, as far as I know, aren’t real, but this one is, though no one seems to believe that poor, old woman,” he answered.\n“Holy shit,” she said, reading the short article. “They attacked people?” she asked.\n“Bad guys only,” Bart answered. “I actually know some of them; or rather I used to know them before they were mermaids.”\n“You mean they weren’t always mermaids?” she asked.\n“Yes, they were people just like you and me. They’ve discovered a way to become mermaids and mermen,” he answered.\nLucia’s jaw literally dropped to her chest. Bart had to stifle a grin. He waited.\n“They BECAME mermaids?” she asked.\n“Yes, it’s a long story, and not important to what we have to do now,” Bart said. “I’ll explain it all later.”\n“You’d better,” she said, trying to gather her wits together. She sat up, struck with a thought.\n“Then why are you their lawyer?” She asked. “I mean, you can’t swim and you hate the water.”\n“That makes me perfect, because I will never be tempted to join them,” he explained.\n“Oh, that makes sense, I guess,” she said. She put her chin in her hands again, drumming her fingers along her lower lip. She sat up again.\n“This is gonna be a shitstorm, isn’t it?” she said, her eyes wide. “A for-real shitstorm of media, black helicopters, and crazy shit.”\n“Exactly,” Bart said.\n“Sorry about the swearing, boss. You just rocked my world,” Lucia said.\n“Don’t worry about it. Hell, I may even let one or two slide out, myself,” he said with a small laugh. “So, here’s what I need you to do … “\n“Well, it is not possible to be sure,” said Galina, looking around at the assembled mer community gathered on the beach in the midday sun. “This is science, right. We need to test on a live subject to be more certain.”\n“And we’re ready for testing?” Danni asked.\nPat nodded, “Yes, the colonization of the hot tub is stable, with the microorganisms staying dormant until they’re triggered by the enhanced superoxide radicals that type II siren cells excrete as metabolic waste. We’ve confirmed that it’s the presence of the ESRs that trigger the cascade of the micros and siren cells into a transformative critical mass.”\n“If only we could stop the siren cells at that stage, we could solve a lot of problems for the transgendered community,” Debra said, smiling at Trixi.\n“Nah,” Trixi said. “Being a mermaid is much better than being a meremaid. ”\n“What’s a type II siren cell?” Peter, the retired chemist, asked. “Are they different cells or do they change roles over time?”\n“They change based on environmental conditions, we think,” Pat answered. “The siren cells function like a stem cell, and so depending on epigenetic or environmental influences, they can become nearly anything. Type I siren cells do cellular repair, which is why we fully restore our health. We don’t actually become younger, as our cells are merely repaired so that they function at optimal levels once again.”\n“Cells are merely repaired,” Peter said. “That’s an incredible understatement.”\n“Probably,” Pat agreed. “Type I Siren cells are nothing compared to Type IIs, however, which are triggered when hormonal shifts in the subject dramatically raises or lowers the levels of prolactin.”\n“Isn’t that one of the hormones that associated lactation?” Peter asked.\n“Yes,” Phoebe answered, jumping in. “This is one reason why mermaids constantly lactate; we have higher levels of prolactin than normal females. But prolactin is in both sexes, and it is the hormone that also reinforces relaxation and submission.”\n“So, it’s not the merman semen that triggers the change?” Sandi asked. “I thought you told us it was; or was it that it would make the change go faster?”\n“We thought so too, originally,” Pat admitted. “But we’ve discovered that the trigger is internal to the changing body, not external to the source of siren cells, which is actually just like the original painted shellfish from which the original goop was created. God, that seems like a lifetime ago, now.”\n“Seems like only yesterday to me, my dear,” John said.\n“So, there’s no difference between siren cells found in mermaid milk and merman semen?” Peter asked.\n“Not any functional difference,” Phoebe said. “Remember that the siren cell’s baseline is a female configuration, which is why all our children are female, just like those fish. When prolactin levels spike or dip, that’s what triggers the change in sex.”\n“So,” Peter said, putting his chin in his hand in the classic ‘thinking’ pose. “A high level of prolactin would trigger a reinforcement of\u0026ndash;or a return to\u0026ndash;the female baseline. Therefore, an act of submission or retreat big enough would trigger a male to female transition in an otherwise normal human male.”\n“Exactly,” Pat said. “And since humans culturally construct oral sex with men as submissive, the subsequent spike in prolactin triggers further change.”\n“So what about the reverse, female to male?” Gabriel asked. “What happened to me?”\n“Prolactin levels drop dramatically when you’re feeling aggressive or powerful, and testosterone, also present in both sexes, spikes,” Phoebe said. “Mers can probably go between sexes more or less like a toggle switch, but the switch to male only happens when there are enough siren cells present, and a huge shift in prolactin levels occurs.”\n“Enough?” Peter asked.\n“Low levels of siren cells tend to be limited to Type I activities,” Pat answered. “Change to or reinforcement of the baseline doesn’t seem to take many siren cells, it just takes time. A little dab will do ya.”\nAfter an awkward pause, Phoebe said, “I told you no one would get that.”\n“Anyway,” Pat continued. “Major changes, like female to male and human to mer, require an abundance of siren cells. However, once a siren cell is present, you will someday be a mer, and probably a mermaid.”\n“So, if there are lots of siren cells, but no change in prolactin, what happens to a man?” Peter asked.\n“That’s one of the things we want to find out,” Pat said.\n“We believe that more siren cells cause a faster Type I effect, but no other change,” Galina said.\n“And what about the tail colors, shapes, sizes, what changes all that?” Gabriel asked.\n“Oh, those are the epigenetic effects of our mer organs,” Phoebe says.\n“Which means you still don’t know,” Gabriel said. “That much I know from my lovely Galina.”\n“Yes,” Pat admitted. “We still don’t know.”\n“And and Type III siren cells the ones that achieve the ultimate transformation into mers?” Peter asked. “What triggers that change?”\n“Yes, Type III’s are the ones that take us from human to mer,” Pat said. “We’re still nailing down the particulars, and we learn more with each transition. The major factor, we believe, is a superabundance of siren cells; that’s why we must feed before we can transition into mers, whereas changes in age and to the female sex are more or less inevitable, once a single siren cell is introduced.”\n“But all this is hypothesis, right?” Peter asked.\n“Pretty good hypothesis,” Galina said haughtily.\n“But we still need confirmation under controlled conditions,” Pat agreed.\n“And that is where we come in,” Peter said, waving his hand over the humans who were sprinkled among the mers. “We’re going to be your test subjects.”\n“If you’re willing,” Pat said.\n“I’m willing,” Valencia said.\nBill Tatnall, Assistant Director of the Electronic Surveillance and Intelligence Command Center of the Central Intelligence Agency stood stiffly at attention in the office of his boss. He only had two more years until retirement, and he was counting the days already.\nTo a casual observer, Bill Tatnall looked like computer nerd, an old computer nerd, but a nerd nevertheless. His clothes looked like they’d been slept in and his hair hadn’t seen a comb in several days. He was a big man and unused to standing for very long. Between the unexpected physical work he was doing and the stress of being called before his boss, he was sweating like a whore in church. Behind him were at least half a dozen other officers and agents who were equally nerdy and equally uncomfortable.\nSusan Perelli, a petite woman with severe, though attractive, features, tapped a pencil on her desk, gazed at Agent Tatnall over her vintage cat-style reading glasses, watching him shift uncomfortably before her. Other than the flinty glint in her eyes, one might easily mistake her for a timid librarian.\n“Didn’t anyone think to simply call?” she asked rhetorically. “This is an intelligence agency, after all. Doesn’t anyone gather intelligence anymore?”\n“It wasn’t our raid,” Bill said, almost apologetically. “I don’t know how we missed it, though. In retrospect the electronic chatter was pretty thick.”\n“Not good enough, Bill. I’ve got my boss demanding answers yesterday,” she said, irritated. “The stupid idiots over at NSA or the Pentagon, I can never tell who does what these days, have a politically problematic prisoner who apparently doesn’t know anything. But no one over there will return any of my calls, and my own elite team has no idea how a military raid on one of our own operatives in his own civilian residence\u0026ndash;a civilian who is now missing, I might add\u0026ndash;could have happened under our noses.”\nBill shifted his weight again as his boss put her face in hands, resting her elbows on her desk. She thought for a few minutes and then raised her head.\n“First priority is to get those goddamn NSA fucks off Taylor’s Island,” she said. “When you and I were there a few years ago, didn’t Jackson mention something about being able to survive nearly any physical or electronic attack? I’ll bet that Mr. Baker will reappear once they leave him alone. I mean, he’s one of ours, for fuck’s sake. Why didn’t they just call us?”\n“Tribes,” Bill said, sensing a break in the tension, running his fingers through his greasy hair. “Fucking tribes.”\n“I’ll get started on tracking down the chain of command and try to get the cowboy who authorized this raid to back down,” Susan said, grabbing her phone. “I want the rest of you to figure out what we missed that would have told us an operation on this scale was happening in our own backyard.”\nEveryone heard the command in her voice and began to leave.\n“Bill,” she said, halting his exit. “Find out everything you can about who has the prisoner and why, see if we can’t find a way to pry him loose.”\n“It’s that friend of Jack’s, right?” Bill asked. “The guy with the boat?”\n“Yes, that’s him,” Susan said. “I wish I had remembered that earlier. Mr. Kyle Johnson of Hopkins, Virginia. Maybe he’s a vet or something. Let’s embarrass the shit out of those idiots.”\n“You got it boss,” Bill said, turning to leave the office.\nSusan watched him retreat to his cubicle. She often felt like a mother hen to her brood of misfits and hackers, constantly tending to their quirky needs, hurts, and slights, all the while herding them back to the task of making the world safe for democracy. Someone had attacked one of her brood, and she wasn’t going to put up with that. She dialed the phone.\n“The Office of the President, please,” she said. “I’d like to speak to Miriam Danders, please.”\nSometimes the best way to find something out was to call up an old friend. Of course, it helped if your old friend was secretary to the chief of staff for the President of the United States.\n“You’ve never even had a speeding ticket?” the Navy JAG officer asked, increasingly frustrated with the taciturn old man across the table from him.\n“Ah, nope,” Kyle Johnson answered, secretly enjoying the obvious stress the young man was under.\n“And you have no idea why Mr. Jackson Baker’s property was raided by … um … our security forces?” the young man asked, flipping nervously through the too thin file folder in his hands.\n“Nope,” he answered.\n“Is there any other information you can share? Sir, you’ve known Mr. Baker for nearly 50 years. Surely you can provide me with some information that will help us settle these issues,” Officer Eldridge Jones said.\n“Known him for 58 years, since we was both five years old,” answered Kyle.\n“Fifty-eight,” Jones wrote on the otherwise blank page in his notebook.\nThe young officer shook his head, amazed he had gotten any information from his prisoner. Deciding on a new tack, he straightened up, and looked Kyle in the eye.\n“Do you have any questions for me?” he asked.\n“Ah, nope,” Kyle answered.\n“Nothing?” Officer Jones asked again. “You haven’t asked any one of the people who have questioned you why you were brought here or what’s going on. Why not?”\n“Would me knowing change anything?” Kyle asked with a wry smile.\nJones furrowed his brow, trying to formulate an answer. There was a knock at the door, and Jones put down his pencil, rose and walked to the door, opening it a crack.\n“A word, Lieutenant?” a feminine, though authoritative voice asked from the hallway.\nThe young JAG officer straightened to attention, walked back to the table, put the file, his notebook, and his pencil in a slim attaché case, and then walked back out into the hallway, closing the door behind him. Kyle remained motionless in his chair, as he had for the past eighteen hours since his arrival at this navy brig. After five minutes of silence, another officer walked into the interrogation room in which Kyle had spent most of his day.\n“Mr. Johnson?” he asked rhetorically.\n“Ah, yup,” Kyle answered, looking up.\n“I’m Captain David Pomo,” he said, extending a hand. Kyle rose and shook it. “I’m sure you have lots of questions, but I’d like you to come with me. It seems that there has been a serious breach of national security which has caused this unfortunate incident to occur.”\n“Shit happens,” Kyle said laconically.\nThe captain looked at his charge humorously, reappraising him.\n“Yes, sir. All the time,” he agreed. “We have some necessary paperwork to fill out, and I am afraid that I’ll have to ask you to sign a confidentiality agreement before I can release you.”\n“You want me not to talk about it?” Kyle asked.\n“Yes, sir,” he answered, opening the door to usher him out.\n“Don’t like talking much anyway,” Kyle said as he walked out the door.\n“Yes, sir. We’ve noticed,” the officer said, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips.\nMichael Thompson stood on the forward deck of The Johanna, watching the retreating tramp merchant ship disappear to the north. He glanced back at Peter and Leonard and watched as they secured the lines and nets that Wong and Tuo’s pods ran around the forty-foot container floating off the stern. The massive, rust red box was nearly as long as The Johanna, but only the top few inches of the shipping box appeared above the surface of the waves.\n“Do you think they bought our story?” Liz asked, watching the ship as it grew smaller and smaller.\n“No. They probably think we’re drug smugglers or something,” Michael said. “It was a Somali ship, and so they probably deliver questionable things all over the globe. I’m sure they think we’re doing something illegal.”\n“Will that be a problem?” Liz persisted.\n“Let’s hope not,” Michael said, watching as the mers made a final loop around the box. “Jaclyn’s lawyer was supposed to take care of everything.”\n“Mr. Kolbert,” Liz nodded. “He was very good at settling up my assets. I’m sure we’ll be fine.”\n“Let’s hope so,” Michael agreed.\n“All set!” Tuo shouted. Peter and Len both gave him a thumbs up.\n“Inflate the bladders,” Michael shouted back to the mers. The colorful pods both disappeared under the waves, and a few seconds later, the massive container rose in the water, supported by inflated air bladders secured by a web of nets and ropes. When the box was nearly halfway out of the water, and drafting nearly the same two meters as The Johanna, Michael shouted, “Alright Liz, all ahead by half.”\nThe engines throbbed, the ropes snapping and creaking as The Johanna pulled the massive container back into the lagoon, which was too shallow for the cargo ship. Michael watched Liz gently guiding both the yacht and the container through the shallow gap in the reef into the pristine lagoon they were now calling home. Peter and Len cast off the ropes as Liz swung the boat back out towards the sea. From behind the container, the water roiled madly as the mers pushed the container from behind like a massive, organic, outboard motor. The box grounded slowly onto the sand of the beach, about ten meters away from the high water mark in the sand.\n“I hope they packed everything in watertight containers ,” Len said. “Otherwise we’re about to ruin a bunch of electronic equipment.”\n“Yea, it’s too bad we don’t have a crane or something,” Peter said.\n“I hope this place never gets a crane,” Tuo said, his breath coming in great gasps while recovering from the effort of trying to push the box further up onto the beach. “Mer power is all that we’ll ever need.”\n“I wish I could agree with you,” Pat said, surfacing next to him. “We’ll probably need all kinds of power if we are to survive the next few months.”\n“I just don’t think we should have a crane,” Tuo said. “It would ruin the lagoon.”\n“Don’t worry, my fine merman,” Pat said, waving Galina, Alexis, and Phoebe forward to start supervising the unloading of the goodies sent by Bart Kolbert to the MMI. “We’ll never put a crane on this island.”\n“Alexis, don’t carry anything heavy, you hear me?” Pat said watching the beautiful pink and white mermaid dash into the now open container, with water sloshing about inside the box.\n“I’m not due for six more months,” Alexis’ voice echoed from within the container. “I’ll be fine.”\n“Where’s Eric when I need him,” Pat asked rhetorically.\n“Over here,” he said, surfacing along with Sally right next to the container. Sally had her eyes fixed on Alexis and her work inside the container.\n“There are just too many mers in the lagoon to keep you all straight,” Pat complained. “Will you please keep an eye on your mate?”\n“I’ll keep an eye on her, because she’s beautiful,” Eric said. “But I might as well order the moon to alter its orbit rather than try to get Alexis to change her mind once she’s made it up.”\n“Not helping,” Pat said with good humor.\n“Don’t worry,” Eric said. “I’ll keep her safe and healthy, but nothing will slow her down. Alexis knows how desperate Sally is to learn what’s happening to her father.”\n“I know,” Pat said. “Me too.”\n“That’s why we’ll have the new and improved satellite up-link working in no time!” Eric said before he ducked inside to join Alexis.\nPetra, Xing, and Gabriel sat in the surf on the north side of the lagoon, watching the commotion surrounding the unloading of the container. Nearby, Danni and John watched over their three children who were playing with Michelle and Bao, and Liga who was nursing Mari. Petra watched as her tall, scientifically inclined pod-mate glanced over a plastic covered paper in one hand while pointing to the mixed assemblage of mers and humans who sorted through those items slated for the caves and those staying topside.\nPetra felt a twinge of guilt watching Galina working with all the others, so many mers and humans toiling together to drag tightly sealed cases up the beach or back out into the surf all strung together in a long chain. She caught Gabriel giving her a long look from where he lay with his tail in the water, his upper torso on the wet sand.\n“I saw that,” he said. “You’re just as important to all of us as Galina, so don’t start feeling guilty that you’re over here with the kids.”\n“Sometimes, mer senses are just too sensitive,” Petra complained. “I can’t keep anything to myself anymore.”\n“Not me,” Gabriel said. “I wouldn’t trade feeling your love the way that I can for all the privacy in the world.”\n“You always know exactly the right thing to say,” Petra said, feeling that special love rising throughout her body. “I love you.”\n“I love you too,” he said as he lay back on the sand, stretching his three-meter long body. “I’m not feeling guilty. Someone has to be over here to protect everyone.”\n“Don’t work too hard,” Petra teased, flipping a bit of sand at him with her pelvic fin.\n“Gotta keep myself ready, energy in reserve,” Gabriel continued, closing his eyes, surveying the lagoon with his mer senses.\n“How long do you think they’ll be gone?” Liga asked as she switched her daughter from one breast to the other. Liga’s pod-mates\u0026ndash;Eric, Sally, and Alexis\u0026ndash;were already halfway up the mountain, along with Peter, getting ready to install the newer and more powerful, solar powered satellite dish and up-link near the top of their extinct volcano.\n“The last time anyone was up there, other than Harold, was about four months ago when Trevor and Rose helped Alexis and Galina set up the gun controls,” Petra said.\n“She was still Robbie back then,” Liga said. “Has it really been that long since a mer went up the mountain?”\n“It’s a long way to salamander,” Petra said. “I only remember Galina going up there once, but she was fine. It did take all day, though. Don’t worry, Eric and Sally know what they’re doing, and Alexis … “\n“Is Alexis,” Liga finished. “She is so stubborn.”\n“She’ll be fine,” Petra said. “I didn’t slow down until my ninth month, and then only just a little. She’s not even showing yet, and so she will be fine.”\n“I just worry,” Liga said.\n“You’re a mother; it’s required,” Petra said with a smile.\n“Yes,” Liga said, looking down at her tiny daughter. “I am.”\n“I wish I had thought of that,” Jack said, watching another camera go off line. The seven men searching the house and island for clues as to Jack’s whereabouts were putting electrical tape over camera lenses as they discovered them. They were intent on depriving him of information. Fortunately, for Jack, they only discovered about half of the tiny devices embedded in rocks, trees, bricks, walls, floors, and ceilings. Nevertheless, they would win that battle with enough time. “Well, eventually we’ll be blind,” he reported, turning towards the mers who were lying together in a erotic heap the middle of the floor. “Can someone give me a break? I gotta go.”\n“I’ll watch,” Bonnie said, extracting herself from her pod mates. She salamandered over to the wall console and pulled herself up onto the stool that Jackson had put there for the mers to perch. Once she was sitting, she curled her tail around the base of the bar stool and turned her attention to the screen. Jackson went into the storage room where an emergency commode sat in one corner. After a moment, he returned to the viewing room.\n“They still haven’t figured out the basement yet,” Annette said encouragingly. “Maybe they won’t?”\nJack shrugged.\n“Maybe we should sabotage their boat,” Mac said.\n“No, that would only bring an intensified response,” Joy said. “As much as I hate waiting, I would hate to see a return of those soldiers. They would tear this place apart until nothing was left.”\n“Hey, something is happening,” Bonnie said, pointing to the screen.\nJack walked over to the computer, looking over Bonnie’s shoulder, noting how her thick hair was now dry and smelling of salt-water and flowers. He was tempted to caress her shoulder and hair, but instead forced his eyes to the computer screen. Although they had lost visuals on about half the house, he could see that the activity had changed from searching to packing.\n“They look like they are packing things up to leave,” Bonnie said.\n“They won’t leave completely,” Jack said. “Either they will leave someone or a monitoring device.”\n“More likely both,” Annette said. “If they do leave, how secure can you make the island?”\n“I can find anything that is giving off a signal not one of my own,” Jack said. “But finding it and disabling it will tell them we’re here.”\n“They are going back to their boat,” Bonnie answered. “But I only count six men. I can’t see where the seventh man might be.”\n“I really wish I had a weapon handy,” Jack said. “All that’s down here are spear guns, which don’t really work well out of the water.”\n“We’ve got weapons,” Mac said, twisting his tail up, exposing his barb to Jackson. “Of course, it’s really only good close up, in hand-to-fin combat.”\n“Hand to fin,” Jack smiled. “I like that.”\n“The seventh man just got onto the boat,” Bonnie reported. “They are all leaving.”\n“Well, Jack … it’s your island,” Annette said. “What do you want to do?”\n“Wait,” he answered.\n“I know,” said Annette turning to Joy, “you hate waiting.” She blew her new sister wife a kiss, which mollified Joy a bit.\n“Alright Bonnie, my turn back at the computer,” Jack said. “While we wait, I’ll try to figure out if any of my calls for help are the reason why our guests have left.”\nValencia watched Harold and Michael drag her father from his hut and brought over to where she stood. Even now, nearly a full day later, she couldn’t believe what was happening to her life. Her life, she thought. Amazing. Although she was still a young man, she now easily thought of herself as a female. Incredible.\nShe thought about the progression she’d undergone. Only a few days ago, “his” only thoughts had been to kill “his” father and take as much money as possible to run away, hide somewhere and try to rebuild “his” life anew. But the mers had changed all that! She could rebuild “his” life completely and in a way that would cause his father humiliation and anguish. To become a girl, and then a mermaid!\nAt first, the idea grew out of anger at her father, but then it sweetened into something that could honor of her mother. Then, in the last twenty-four hours, the idea grew even larger, evolving into something more, something exciting, and something erotic. As a teenager, she never fantasized about being a girl, but now that it had happened, it became increasingly exciting to her. She reached down and adjusted the swim trunks she’d borrowed from the stash of clothing the mers no longer needed, trying to restrain her penis.\nAs she watched Harold and Michael drag Malaki towards her, she tried to imagine feeling attracted to Harold. Intellectually, she could understand why a girl might be attracted to the short, but well-built young man. Harold’s dirty blond hair was long and wavy, and uncut since he had arrived on the island. His face was handsome, a strong chin, a quick and easy smile, and clear blue eyes. His modest build was well proportioned and deeply tanned. Valencia saw it all, but there was no spark, nothing.\nShe looked back over at Maja and Antonia, relaxing after feeding from the mermaids. Even after only a few feedings, the changes in both girls were dramatic. When they first arrived, each girl, though beautiful in her own way, was haggard, worn, and beaten down. Their hair was dull and tangled, their eyes sallow and dark, and their skin bruised and pockmarked. Now, both were the picture of health and vitality.\nValencia’s cock reassuringly twitched as her gaze washed over the two shorter women. Maja was a petite Filipina, barely five foot tall (154 cm), with classic dark hair, dark eyes, and a slender figure. Antonia also had dark hair, but she was nearly five inches taller than Maja and had flashing green eyes and a generous, attractive pear-shaped figure. Her face was a classic, pale oval, reflecting many New Zealanders’ Celtic heritage.\nValencia looked over her own, still male body. She and Harold were both about five feet eight inches tall, and she wondered if she would become much shorter. Her gaze swept back over the two girls, and she imagined herself becoming a delightful mix of those two. She wondered what breasts would actually feel like, and she hoped she would get ones more like Antonia’s than Maja’s breasts.\nThe three of them started feeding from mother mermaids the previous evening to prepare for the afternoon’s experiment. Harold had not fed, which was also part of the experiment. Valencia could still taste the sweetness of Petra’s milk she finished drinking only a few moments ago. Her hands trembled as she touched her lips, remembering the feeling of that incredible breast pressed into her mouth, the large nipple gushing milk down her throat. She didn’t think she wanted breasts that big, but the thought was exciting.\nValencia looked again at Petra. Oh my, she thought to herself, Petra used to be a man! It was hard for her to believe that anything so powerfully female, so beautiful, so graceful, could have once been a man. Her cock twitched again.\n“Do you feel anything changing yet?” Maja asked, startling Valencia out of her reverie.\n“Not really,” Valencia answered. “You?”\n“Yes,” Maja answered. “I’m growing.”\n“You and Antonia are slowly maturing to about your mid-twenties,” Petra answered. “And your breasts and hips are growing more than they might have normally. Valencia was already in her twenties, so she won’t change much until the type II’s kick in.”\n“How much more will my breasts grow?” Maja asked, looking down at her tee shirt which was already tenting more dramatically since yesterday.\n“Hard to tell,” Petra said. “Part of the experiment you guys are undertaking is that you’re not bonding to a male yet. Normally that focus has some influence. Once you get to the mountainside tub, the changes will finish in only a few minutes.”\n“Only a few minutes, and I’ll be legal to drink in bars,” Maja giggled.\n“Yes, and then you’ll look twenty-five or so for many, many, more years,” Petra said.\n“How much influence can a male exert?” Valencia asked.\n“A lot, as far as we can tell,” Petra said. “But it doesn’t have to be a male; it can be anyone with mer organs. I was among a mixed group when I became exactly what I wanted to be.”\n“You wanted to look like that, I mean, the way that you do now?” Valencia asked her. “I mean you’re beautiful, but … um … wow.”\n“Yes, I know,” said Petra smiling and stroking one of her incredible breasts. “You’re too young to remember, but there was a nude model who looked like me back in the 1980s. I asked my pod-mates to help me look like her, and it worked.”\n“Valencia is still a male,” Maja said playfully. “Maybe you’re affecting my breasts?” She arched her slim body, pushing forward her small, but growing, breasts.\n“It could be anyone here,” Valencia protested. “And if you don’t stop teasing me, you’ll ruin the experiment,” she continued, pushing her penis back between her legs. “I’m trying to become your sister-wife, and you’re not helping.”\n“Maybe we are all affecting each other,” Antonia said, gently caressing Maja’s growing curves. “My breasts are growing too, but not as much as yours.”\n“Mermaids have larger than average breasts,” Petra said, still stroking her extraordinary examples. “After all, they have to do a lot of work.”\n“You didn’t need yours to grow,” Maja said to Antonia. “Yours were already beautiful.”\n“I never thought I’d think of myself as beautiful ever again,” Antonia said, smiling and looking around at the paradise in which she found herself. “I hated my body, and I hated my life.”\n“Me too,” Maja said. “I can’t believe we got rescued.”\n“I can’t believe we’re going to be mermaids!” Antonia said.\n“Tell me about it,” Valencia said, smiling at her future pod-mates. “I hope I turn out as beautiful as you two?”\n“You’ll be beautiful,” Antonia said. “It starts on the inside; that’s where it counts.”\n“Thanks, I’ll do my best,” Valencia said, a tear forming in her eye. “Is all of this o.k. with you two?” she asked.\n“What do you mean, O.K.?” Antonia asked.\n“You know, this whole changing and bonding thing,” Valencia said, looking down.\n“I can’t wait,” Antonia said.\n“Really?” Valencia asked.\n“Thanks to your dad, my life was over, ruined,” Antonia said without malice. “I thought for a long time that I would die, and there were times when I really wanted to.”\n“Me too,” Maja said, her attention drawn away from her breasts for a moment.\n“This whole … everything … is … so … unexpected, so amazing,” Antonia continued, waving her hand over the horizon. “It’s like a rebirth, a second chance.”\n“A baptism!” Maja said. “We have to go in water and everything to do it! We’re going to be reborn, baptized!”\n“Yeah, well, I suppose you could look at it like that,” Antonia agreed.\n“Sorry, I was raised Catholic,” Maja said. “But that sort of died after the fiftieth rape.”\n“Anyway,” Antonia said, steering the conversation away from religion and prostitution. “I really like the vibe here, you know? I feel like I’m a little girl again, and I’ve regained some sense of my innocence that was taken from me.”\n“Wow,” Valencia said. “Yea, I can see what you mean. I guess I feel that way too, except I don’t know what it’s like to be a little girl.”\n“That’s alright, you can skip to the woman part,” Maja said. “I hated being a little girl, mostly because I was really little.”\n“I think you’re beautiful,” Valencia said.\n“Thanks. Hey, what do you want to look like?” Maja asked. “Even though this is an experiment, can we still affect her?” she asked, turning to Petra.\n“I don’t know,” Petra said. “Your proto-mer organs may not be developed enough to affect the process, and those organs are what affects those changes.”\n“What’s going to happen to me, do you think?” Valencia asked.\n“I think you should end up looking like other women in your family,” Petra said. “But you all have had several feedings from mother mermaids, and the changes are much quicker with mother’s milk. So, maybe some effects will still be possible.”\n“I hope so,” Valencia said. “I want to be little bit like both Maja and Antonia.”\n“Man! All this talk … about changing! Wow! I don’t think I’ve ever been this turned on before in my life,” Maja said. “When I was a slave for Anjo, nothing ever turned me on. I had to fake everything, but now, everything seems to turn me on!”\n“Sex is always wonderful when all the participants are willing,” Petra said. “That’s what’s so great about being a mer. There’s always someone loving you who is willing. Nothing is better than making love. Anyone can have sex.”\n“And here it was that I thought I was just horny all the time,” Xing said, leaning over to kiss her pod-mate.\n“You can call it anything you like,” Petra said after they kissed. “As long as you keep kissing me like that.”\n“Valencia,” Pat called out as she emerged from the surf with several other mers. “You ready?”\n“I’m ready,” Valencia answered, watching Pat salamander towards her.\n“I’d like you all to swallow this,” she said as she pulled her hand from a pocket in her slim utility belt that nearly all the mers wore. In her palm were four small, purple capsules.\n“These are sensors that will monitor your changes from within. It transmits data to this receiver,” she said as Phoebe handed her a small device. “If one of you will take this with you, it will relay the information to our computers in the lab.”\nAntonia sprang up and examined one of the capsules in Pat’s hand.\n“It won’t hurt him, I mean, her, will it?” she asked, looking protectively at Valencia.\n“I’ll be fine,” Valencia said, taking a pill from Pat and swallowing it. Behind them, they heard Malaki’s muffled curses.\n“The internal power will only last about six or seven hours, and it should pass naturally within a day or two,” Pat explained. “If it works, we’ll do ones for each of you when you transition to mers.”\n“Well, alright then,” Antonia said, taking a pill and the small box from Pat. “But I’ll be mad if something happens to her.”\n“I promise, the sensor is safe,” Pat said. “Now, off you go!”\nValencia took two pills and handed one to Maja and the last one to Harold, which they swallowed as well. Antonia swallowed hers and reached down to Maja and helped her up, and then the three “girls” joined hands and headed for the jungle path that would take them up to the hot tub. Behind them, Harold, Michael, Len, and Peter dragged Malaki who was refusing to do anything that his captors asked of him. They disappeared into the dense jungle.\n“Alright, back to the lab, and let’s see what happens,” Pat said, the mers then returning to the sea as the afternoon sun beat down upon the waters of the lagoon.\nThe MuSu’s pod retreated to their favorite beach, where Trevor had first observed them making love. The Henderson triplets and their mate, MuSu, swam around the northern edge of the lagoon while Emma walked overland and met them there. Emma Henderson and the Basras weren’t scheduled to participate in their part of the experiments for a few more days, and so Emma’s daughters planned a family picnic for the afternoon.\nThey had just finished their picnic and were relaxing in the shallow surf, their mother still wearing one of Michael Thompson’s tee shirts. The surf on this side of the island normally surged up the steep coastline, crashing over the rocks on either side of the small, rocky cove, thumping onto the tiny beach. Today, however, the surf was gentle, and the group was taking shelter from the heat in the sea. They sat about two meters from the water line in about one meter of water, staying cool, and relaxing.\n“We should ask them if you can start feeding,” Cleo said, stroking her mother’s face, her fingers tracing the horrific scars and burn marks.\n“It’s O.K., my dear, I’ve lived with this face for a long time, and I can wait a few days more,” Emma said. “Besides, it’s about to become quite another face.”\n“I wish you weren’t …” Cleo started, and then turned away.\n“It’s O.K. dear,” Emma said, giving her daughter a pat on her shoulder. “I know it’s hard to lose your mother so soon after you got her back. But, you’ll really be getting both your father and I back, in a way.”\n“I just … I can’t …” Cleo started crying into her hands and Rikki and her sister Emma gathered her into their arms. MuSu scooted over as well, adding a hand to the group hug.\n“I know it’s hard, Cleo, but think of how brave mum’s being, and all that she’s been through,” Rikki said. “You wouldn’t want her to be reminded, for the rest of her life, about those terrible men and what they did to her, would you?”\n“No, nooo, I … do … understand,” Cleo said between sobs. “I just wanted … my mother back. Why are you … doing this?”\n“I think your sister Emma can answer that,” Emma said.\n“Me?” her newest daughter squeaked. “What? I was a boy who wanted to be a mermaid, not a girl who wanted to be a merman.”\n“Yes, exactly,” her mother answered. “Who you were on the outside didn’t match who you became on the inside.”\n“I think I understand,” MuSu said. “You’ve been changed by your experiences, and you can’t simply go back to being Emma Henderson anymore than I can go back to being a silly and careless girl named Mai Lin.”\n“Oh, MuSu,” Cleo said. “I want to forget those days forever! Promise me you’ll never mention them again.”\n“Cleo, stop being so dramatic,” Rikki said. “MuSu, I’ll never forget those days, and you weren’t a silly or a careless girl. You were a beautiful and stubborn girl who refused to yield to your captors. You were very brave, in my opinion, and you’re still very brave.”\n“It’s an act of bravery to love the three of us,” Emma said, grinning at her sisters.\n“My life is for you three,” MuSu said simply.\nHe stiffened slightly, orienting on a patch of water about fifteen meters out. His girls felt the shark too, but they felt no danger and did turn around to watch. MuSu was there to protect them, after all. Emma Henderson, however, faced the surf and gasped when the dorsal fin emerged about ten meters out, rising to her feet.\n“Shark!” she screamed.\n“There is no danger,” MuSu said, keeping his eyes glued on the shark. “He is not hungry, just curious.”\n“How can you tell?” Emma asked warily.\n“He just can,” Emma said. “We all can, actually. It’s a part of our mer senses. We can sense things that are alive, and we can sense the mood they’re in.”\n“He cannot eat twice,” MuSu said, watching the dorsal fin turn away from the beach. “Just as we cannot go back to what we once were.”\n“Yes, well, I hope you’re right about the shark,” Emma senior said. “But, you’re right about me. I cannot go back. It would simply hurt too much, and if I’m to move forward, I need to move in a completely new direction. Now, Cleo, don’t cry anymore. I’m not dying. You’ve saved me! My three amazing and lovely children saved me! Now, I intend to make that miracle mean something. I’m going to give myself to the Basras and do my best to protect them, like MuSu does for you.”\n“But we still need you!” Cleo said, still sniffling.\n“You’ve got each other and MuSu,” Emma said. “And you’re nearly ready to be needed by someone else. Then you’ll know more about why I’m taking this new path.”\n“Who else needs me?” Cleo whined.\n“We do,” said Emma and Rikki together.\n“We do, indeed,” MuSu repeated, turning away from the surf for a glance and a smile. “But your honorable mother did not mean us.”\n“Who, then?” Cleo asked.\n“Cleo! Seriously?” Rikki asked, exasperated.\n“I don’t know,” Cleo whined.\n“Our own children, Cleo! You know, babies. Sometimes I can hardly believe you’re my sister!” Emma said.\n“Look who is talking!” Cleo shot back.\n“Girls!” Emma senior interrupted. When she had their attention, she continued. “I think I let the fact that you all look much older than you are color my thinking. You may look twenty-five, but you’re still teenagers. Perhaps you need more time before you take on that responsibility, maybe in a few more years. Now, let’s enjoy ourselves for the afternoon with no more squabbling.”\n“Sorry, mum,” Cleo said.\n“Sorry, sis,” Emma said.\nRikki and MuSu sighed.\n“So, mate to my daughters, what’s it like?” Emma asked. “Being a merman after being a girl?”\nMuSu looked at his mother-in-law and pondered. After a moment, he said, “It has been an honorable choice; a blessing to be their mate. I think you will find that some of your same instincts will be useful after you have changed.”\n“My instincts?” Emma asked.\n“Though my gender has changed, I am still responsible to these little ones,” he said, nodding at his girls. “I cannot call it mothering, but being mated to them sometimes seems as I once imagined being a mother to children.”\n“Are you sure that isn’t you and your particular mermaids?” Emma asked. “Now, I’m not saying you’re childish, but you are my children. I am allowed to make that judgement.”\n“I’m not childish,” Cleo said. Emma and Rikki wisely kept quiet.\n“I cannot speak intimately for others,” MuSu said. “However, my observations and conversations with other mermen support my conclusions. Each pod has its own personality, quirks, and needs, but loving another is always both a uncompromising sacrifice and a sacred pleasure. It would not be an exaggeration to say that loving three others requires even greater sacrifice, but it is attended with commensurate pleasure.”\n“You are a wise merman, MuSu,” Emma said. “I hope I can be as wise as you. But I want to better prepare myself for the change. What should I expect?”\nMuSu thought for a moment. Then he spoke.\n“It is hard to say. Like yourself, I was abused by men, and my choice was partly to become strong\u0026ndash;to not be a victim. The physical changes are significant, very much. The mental changes are even more profound. As a girl, I remember feeling it was allowable to be passive, and now that sentiment seems alien to me. There are many other things too. But …”\n“But what?” Emma asked.\n“But the sweetness of your mates cannot be described\u0026ndash;the connection, the ache, the need, the desire. It is both wondrous and agonizing,” MuSu finished.\nEmma watched as MuSu shared a look with her daughters that went beyond any look, any feeling, she could remember sharing with her own husband. She suddenly felt like a fifth wheel, so to speak, but just as she was about to leave, MuSu turned back to her and smiled.\n“Such sweetness after such suffering is worthy of any sacrifice,” he said.\nThe butterflies started fluttering in Valencia’s stomach long before they arrived at the hot tub. For most of the hike up the mountain, her excitement and desire overwhelmed her fears. Her fears resurfaced when she saw the tub itself, filled with the microorganisms that would speed her change into a female once she triggered them. What might normally take several weeks or longer would now take minutes. She stopped, transfixed by the weight of what was about to happen to her.\n“You alright?” Antonia asked. “I feel a little bloated.” She patted her bulging tummy under her tee shirt. The three of them had wolfed down as much protein as they could stand to serve as fuel for the changes now facing them.\n“Me? I’m fine,” Valencia answered, trying to talk herself out of her fears. “It’s all just … it’s really \u0026hellip;”\n“I think you’re being very brave,” Antonia said. “I don’t think I’ve told you that yet.” She paused, and then spoke. “I wasn’t prepared to like you when we first met, and after I found out who your father was, I liked you even less. But now, I’m pretty sure I’m going to like you more than just a little bit.”\n“Thanks,” Valencia answered, feeling her cock reassuringly twitch in response to the attentions of a pretty girl. “I thought you were a beautiful girl the moment I first saw you, and I’m learning that you’re also a wonderful person. I’m very sorry for what my father’s men did.”\n“Don’t worry about that,” Antonia said. “It wasn’t your fault, and besides, you’re proving yourself to be very different from him.”\n“Yea, I’m going to be really, really different from him in just a little while,” Valencia said with a laugh. “I just hope I can do it. I mean, I don’t know if I really can force myself to surrender.”\n“What do you mean?” she asked. “You think being a girl is surrender? I know what the mers said about the hormones and stuff, but being a girl is not about being passive or giving up. Are you afraid to become a girl?”\n“No, no!” Valencia answered. “I know what you mean. My mother was the strongest person I knew, even though she was … anyway, no, I want to be a girl. It’s just that … I have always tried to … well, to be honest, I can never seem to do anything right,” she confessed in a quiet voice.\n“You’ve been doing things right for the past few days,” Antonia said. “Besides, we’ll help you if you need it. Maja and I won’t leave you.”\n“That’s what is keeping me sane,” Valencia said. “I know we haven’t known each other for long, but I can’t tell you how much it means to me that you’re in this with me. I already feel closer to you than I have to any other person since my mother.”\n“Well, that’s about the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me,” Antonia said, giving her a kiss on the cheek. “Besides, I meant what I said; we will not abandon you. Besides, there’s always Harold if it comes to that. The experiment can go hang if you get stuck.”\n“I know,” Valencia said. “But I really want to show myself and my father that I can do this from within, without being held down by someone else.”\n“And so you will!” Antonia said. “Now, you just march over to that pool and show your father what real courage is.”\nValencia squared her shoulders and took a few deep breaths to calm herself down. She walked over and sat on the edge of the pool, watching as the men dragged her father to the other side.\nThe four men dragged Malaki to the far side of the hot tub near where the bamboo piping brought water to this rocky outcropping. They lashed the still struggling man to rocks marking the start of the cliff rising above and further beyond the pool. Harold showed Antonia where the listening hole was, and after securing Malaki, all four men returned to the huts to await the end of this stage of the experiment.\nAntonia carefully placed the relay box next to the listening hole, and then returned to the rocky pool. Maja had already taken off her tee shirt and was in the pool, and so Antonia lifted her tee shirt away and joined her. They both dunked themselves in the water, washing off the grime of the hike, and then drifted towards the ledge facing away from the mountain, enjoying the view. Valencia was also enjoying the view of the two young girls as the water cascaded off their bodies.\n“Anything yet?” Maja asked.\n“No,” Antonia said. “Pat said it might take a few minutes to start,”\nMaja nodded, and then turned to Valencia.\n“Just a few minutes more,” she winked at the apparent young man. “Then you can join us.”\n“Literally,” Antonia said, nervously.\nThe two girls swam for a few more minutes, enjoying the warm water. Then, Antonia remembered what Pat had told her about the rocks, and she placed several over some of the holes next to the cliff wall that were whistling with warm air. Soon the redirected air forced bubbles to appear in the hot tub. The bubbles were large and burped as they surfaced.\n“That’s nice,” Maja said. “It tickles.”\nAfter a few more minutes of swimming, they noticed microscopic bubbles forming on their bodies.\n“It’s started,” Maja said, watching as the tiny bubbles began to break free from her body.\nThe both settled into the center of the pool to watch the progress their bodies were making. Soon, hundreds of thousands of tiny bubbles were breaking free all over their bodies.\n“That’s amazing,” Valencia said, watching the water gently fizz around the two girls.\n“Oh, my,” Maja groaned. “My hips hurt.”\n“Mine don’t,” Antonia said, “but my shoulders do.”\n“You’re maturing to your mid-twenties in mere minutes,” Valencia reminded them. “Pat said it would cause some discomfort.”\n“This isn’t discomfort,” Maja complained. “This hurts.”\n“Duck under the water,” Antonia said. “Let’s get this over with.”\nBoth girls ducked under the water, bubbles forming on their faces and hair as well. They held themselves below the surface for about thirty seconds or so, and then surfaced for a breath and sank again.\nValencia turned her attention to her father as he watched the two pretty girls transforming themselves into proto-mers. She snorted as she watched him leer at them despite his circumstances. Malaki was still a man, and both Maja and Antonia were beautiful young women who were becoming even more beautiful. After about five minutes, the bubbles stopped forming, and both girls stood up in the pool.\nThey had changed dramatically. Their hair had grown down to their hips. Maja’s slender figure had matured into a classic hourglass, her A-cup breasts were now a modest C, her hips wider, and her face lost its baby fat. Antonia’s face also matured, her breasts were now a D-cup, and her torso was hourglass shaped, her shoulders matching her generous hips. Like all proto-mermaids, both girls’ nipples had grown as well, each rising like a mini-volcano from the round, soft surface of their larger breasts.\n“That felt incredible,” Maja said. “Antonia, turn around, quick! Let me see your back.”\nAntonia spun around, and Maja parted Antonia’s hair and exposed her back. There, both Valencia and Maja could see the pink areas of her skin that soon would become her gills.\n“How’s that feel?” Maja asked as she stroked the pink strips lightly.\n“Oh, sensitive,” Antonia shivered away from Maja, turning towards Valencia. “We’ve got proto-mer organs, so we can help you become whatever you want.”\n“Just make me beautiful, a mix of the two of you,” Valencia said, taking her swim trunks off and slipping into the water, her stiff cock jutting from her still male body.\n“What do we do?” Maja asked.\n“Just focus on her as she changes,” Antonia said. “Imagine how she should look, put a picture in your mind.”\n“And that will work?” Maja asked.\n“That’s what they told us,” Antonia said.\nThe warm water caressed Valencia as she slipped in, her modestly sized penis painfully erect. Pushing herself towards the center of the pool, she let her knees rest on the bottom, her chin just reaching the top of the still bubbling water. She faced her father and felt the anger and hurt she’d born all these years rise to the surface again. Tears began to flow down her cheeks as she stared at her father, feeling sad for her mother, for her brothers, and for the lives that this selfish man had manipulated, used, and discarded.\n“Just focus on relaxing, on letting the siren cells change you,” Antonia said. “We’re supposed to just stay in the tub with you.”\nValencia nodded, and returned her gaze to her father. She tried to relax, but the anxieties that swirled within her wouldn’t let her. She screwed her eyes shut, concentrating, but after a few minutes she opened them. Nothing was happening.\nEven with the gag, Malaki’s laugh of derision was clear to his son and the two girls. Valencia stood up and made a move to swim over to him to confront him.\n“No!” Antonia said, stopping her. “Don’t let anger overwhelm you. Concentrate on relaxing. Remember that there is strength in bending before the wind. A woman’s strength is different from a man’s, but it is strength just the same. You’re not surrendering, you’re becoming.”\nValencia stopped and looked at her future sister-wife. She saw the compassion in her eyes, and laid back into the water. She closed her eyes and focused on relaxing. After calming herself, she opened her eyes.\n“Watch me father,” she said softly, like a sigh, holding her arms in front of her, just under the surface. “Two sons are now female dolphins, another is a stupid, selfish brute who’s probably going to be killed without your protection, and your youngest son is becoming a mermaid. Who will run your empire now?”\nMalaki struggled against his shackles, but the ropes were too secure. The gag muffled another series of swear words, but the strain of being tied up for several days was taking its toll, and he gave up after only a few seconds.\n“Look, father, the bubbles are beginning to form,” said Valencia as the prickling, tingling bubbles started to gather. A sense of triumph washed over her, and she smiled.\nShe held her position for several seconds, but the bubbles slackened and then disappeared. She saw her father’s eyes gleam in triumph again. She looked over at her pod-mates and said, in a small voice, “Help.”\nThey both looked at Valencia’s father, and then back at the boy who was trying to become a girl. They nodded to one another and moved closer, arranging themselves on either side of Valencia.\nMaja dipped a cupped hand into the water and raised it over Valencia’s head.\n“Do you want to join us?” she asked.\nValencia nodded.\n“Do you accept the gift of womanhood and the love of your sister-wives?” Antonia asked, getting into the spirit of the moment.\n“Yes, very much,” Valencia said.\n“Do you wish to know the special strength and power that being a woman entails?” Antonia continued.\n“Yes, I do,” Valencia said, looking at her father. His eyes were wide with terror.\nEach girl each put a hand on a shoulder and focused their thoughts on Valencia turning into a girl.\n“Give yourself to us,” Antonia whispered in Valencia’s ear.\n“Bend before the wind,” Maja said, and she poured the water over Valencia’s head.\nValencia gasped as the warm water flowed down her scalp, and a shiver ran through her body. Their hands on her shoulders felt comforting and sensuous. She wasn’t sure if she was imagining it, but she felt SOMETHING coming from each girl. With her sister-wife’s words and soft breath in her ears, she looked at her father with a different sense of strength and determination. She felt connected to these two girls, and relaxed into that connection.\nHer past seemed to rise up within her, but she focused her feelings on the connection she was sharing with these girls, using that warmth and love to erase those hurts and pains. She remembered the beatings suffered as a young boy, the feelings of loss when her mother was killed, and the taunts of her schoolmates because she was Malaki’s son. She focused on accepting these losses, on giving herself to her emotions and to the energies of the two girls. The microscopic bubbles reappeared.\n“Look father, it’s working,” Valencia said. “I’m giving up my manhood, I’m … ooooohhhhhhhhhhh,” she groaned as the water around her began to boil, the bubbles increasing, rolling off her body like a sudden storm.\nShe closed her eyes and forced a smile on her face, knowing that her smile would torture her father. Maja and Antonia’s hands left her shoulder, forced away by the millions of tiny bubbles erupting all over her skin. A mist of tiny bubbles rose around her head as they fizzed all around her. The water smelled like ozone after a thunderstorm. Pressure built up over her entire body, and she began to moan as her body was reshaping from the inside out.\nA pain stabbed at her abdomen, and she doubled over, her head pitching forward into the water. She screamed into the water, knowing her father wouldn’t hear it, her own air joining the millions of bubbles all around her. She felt bubbles form on her face, and she braced herself, holding herself underwater, willing the change to flow through her body.\nThe siren cells and the microorganisms assaulted her face, and her skull felt like jelly. She forced herself to remain under, her lungs burning. Maja and Antonia pulled gently on her shoulders, turning her in the water so that she faced the surface. She lifted her face briefly, gasping in a fresh breath of air, and then surrendered herself back to the power of the water and the bubbles. She went limp, knowing her podmates would support her body, allowing her head to stay below the surface of the rolling water for a few seconds and then pulling her up for a quick breath.\nValencia relaxed her legs and they extended out towards her father, her body just below the surface of the water. Enormous pressures burst within her lower abdomen. Her hips seemed to be on fire, and her feet crushed. There was pain, but it was bearable, and more importantly, she could focus on it, give herself to it, let it bend her. The bubbles continued to boil as the changes swept over her body.\nThe water pulled at her scalp, and she knew that her hair was growing at a phenomenal rate. Another gasping breath and then below again as her torso compressed, her ribs aching, her waist creeping up towards her ribs and shrinking, her internal organs shifting and changing. Her chest went into spasms, and accidentally she drank some water, feeling it burn as she half-swallowed and half-aspirated the foaming liquid. She rose, coughed out some water, took another breath, and forced herself back under the surface.\nShe felt a mighty tug in her groin, forcing her hips to the surface, inadvertently flashing her father as her body absorbed her male genitals. She gasped another breath and sank again, the bubbles seeming to pull the skin from her body. The jelly like feeling in her face and skull passed, and her bones stopped aching. She took another breath and sank.\nA tightness grew in her chest and then a pressure, and her breasts began to grow. They pushed out into the water, her nipples expanding and growing, the bubbles tickling them into mini erections. Then slowly, the pressure and the bubbles eased, the water calmed, and Valencia floated to the surface.\nAs she took a calming breath, she could feel the air on her face and breasts as they poked up from the water, her nipples tightening further. She let her wide hips drop and found the bottom of the pool with her feet. She tilted her head back to force her now very long hair to slide down her back as she lifted her head from the water. Then she lifted her hands and looked at her now slender and beautiful appendages, water dripping from her fingers. She smiled at Antonia and Maja, feeling a new level of connection to her pod-mates, knowing that soon they would be joining them in an even more profound and beautiful way.\nShe lifted her eyes to her father and saw his open terror. She smiled again, knowing that her smile was now beautiful, wide, and full.\n“Father, how do I look?” she asked slowly rising up onto her feet, the water lapping at her belly button, her breasts settling onto her chest, their weight pulling her forward slightly. Her hair plastered along her back, and she felt her new center of gravity between her wide hips.\nMalaki shook his head, refusing to believe that the beauty that stood before him was his son. My god, he thought his eyes wide with shock, what were these monsters going to do to him?\n“I think you’re beautiful,” Maja said breathlessly. “That was amazing to watch.”\n“What do I look like?” Valencia asked.\n“You look wonderful! Oh, you look a lot like Vanessa Minnillo,” Maja said. “She was born in the Philippines but is an actress in America. She is half Filipino and half Irish-Italian.”\n“I don’t know who that is,” Antonia admitted. “And I don’t care. You are the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. I can’t believe I’m getting this turned on by a woman.”\n“You two have been turning me on since I first saw you,” Valencia said. “But we should let Harold know we’re ready for the next phase of the experiment. I don’t want him,” jerking her head towards her father, “to be here for any of that.”\nAntonia glided over to the edge of the pool and lifted herself up and out, the water sluicing off her sleek, pale body. She walked over to the tree line and peered down the path towards the huts. “Harold, we’re ready,” Antonia shouted through the trees. She turned on her heel and looked back at the pool.\n“What are you two looking at?” she asked innocently.\n“You’re so beautiful,” Valencia said. “I mean, you were beautiful before, but now …”\n“Yea,” Maja said.\n“Thanks, mates,” Antonia said, walking back towards the pool like a model on a catwalk. “A girl could get used to this attention.”\nShe stepped back into the pool, ducked under the water, pushed off the bottom, and swam underwater over to join her two pod-mates. She popped up between them, and she pressed her body against Valencia’s, their breasts pressing together.\n“Hey old man,” Antonia shot over her shoulder towards Malaki. “It’s too bad you won’t get to see the next part of the experiment. You have no idea what you’re missing.” She kissed Valencia deeply as Maja stroked their bodies.\nMalaki tried to curse, but he felt drained, physically and emotionally. He just hung there limply, trapped in the ropes.\nThe girls broke off their kiss when they heard the four men approaching up the path. They watched the men untie Malaki and pull him over to a stretcher they brought. Malaki never struggled and lay unmoving on the stretcher after they dropped him on it.\n“Just in case he’s playing possum,” Michael said, lashing him securely.\nPeter and Len grabbed the front of the stretcher and Michael and Harold lifted the rear. They stood up in unison.\n“Harry will be back in a little while. Don’t get started without him,” Michael teased as they began their march back down the mountain.\n“Harold. My name is Harold,” he said with a laugh, as they started down the mountain. He turned just before he disappeared into the jungle for a last look at his girls.\nThe three of them stood in the center of the pool, holding hands. They looked at him expectantly, their young, trim bodies covered with a sheen of water. They were each extraordinarily beautiful women, their bodies the picture of sensual, sexual ripeness.\n“I’ll be right back,” he shouted.\nValencia watched Harold’s butt as he disappeared into the jungle. His butt! At last! There was a spark!\n“He’s got a cute butt,” Antonia said. “Don’tcha think?”\nValencia smiled and blushed.\n“Give her time,” Maja said. “Remember the first time you thought boys weren’t icky?”\n“I don’t think she feels like boys are icky anymore,” Antonia said.\n“At least not that one,” Valencia said, nodding towards the retreating men.\n“Well, are you ready for part two?” Antonia asked.\n“We’re going to bond just with each other, right?” Maja asked.\n“Yes, they are going to monitor changes to our mer organs,” Antonia said.\n“There’s no going back once we have sex together, right?” Maja asked.\n“That’s right, we’ll be bonded,” Valencia said. “Are you sure you want me?”\n“Are you kidding? You’re the hottest thing I’ve ever seen!” Maja said. “I finally feel like a woman who wants to have sex instead of one who is forced to!”\n“Valencia, you’ve proven yourself to be a good person, and now you’re a beautiful woman,” Antonia said, turning towards her. “Please become my sister wife? You too, Maja, let’s make this official.”\n“Kay,” Maja said, as they both faced Valencia in the pool.\n“Do you, Valencia, take Maja and I to be your sister wives?” Antonia asked.\nValencia gazed at the petite beauty who was becoming her pod-mate, a quickening rising in her abdomen as her gaze washed over Maja’s curves. Her long dark hair glistened as it lay plastered against her light brown skin. Her Clara Bow lips were open, and her light brown eyes sparkled with light as she returned Valencia’s gaze.\nValencia’s eyes flicked over to Antonia, the middle girl perfectly positioned between Maja’s five foot even and her own five foot eight. Valencia admired Antonia’s generously curved body, much more luscious than her own. Antonia’s dark hair contrasted sharply with her pale skin, her large breasts bursting through the veil of black hair. Her light green eyes were also appraising the young woman who returned her gaze, and her lush lips spreading in a hungry smile of approval.\n“I do,” she said, her voice husky with desire.\n“Do you, Maja …” Antonia started.\n“I do, I do! Both of you!” Maja said, interrupting. “Do you, Antonia take Valencia and I?”\n“I do,” Antonia said, glancing at both girls. There was a pause.\nValencia felt both girls’ eyes wash over her, and she shivered. She watched as Antonia’s eyes moved over her face, then down her graceful throat to her new, firm C-cups, jutting from her sleek and slender torso. She glanced down at her breasts for the first time and watched as her nipples crinkled with excitement, pointing directly at the other young women standing in the pool. She felt a warmth build in her belly and bent over to look at her wide hips, her soft, feminine stomach, and the soft patch of hair now hiding her new vagina, the water just covering the top of her patch of new hair.\n“Let us bond,” Antonia said, bringing her hands up to her breasts, stroking them.\nValencia took her breasts in her hands and felt their weight, slowly pulling on them, teasing her nipples. She watched as both Antonia and Maja did the same. The weight and texture of her breasts felt wonderful in her hands, and it was even more exciting to watch the two other girls match her own movements. Their eyes fluttered with passion, their breath coming in labored gasps as they stroked their own bodies together.\n“Yes, let’s start like this,” Maja said.\nValencia groaned and pulled hard on her nipples, the sharp, sweet sensation racing between her breasts and her throbbing vagina. She let one hand drop, snaking towards her crotch. Heat seemed to flow from her new genitalia, even in comparison to the warm water in the pool. She dipped a finger into her new opening and gasped, from both the searing heat that gripped her digit and the tightness penetrating it.\n“Oh … goooooooooodddddd,” she groaned as she moved her finger in and out of her sex. “It never felt like this before.”\n“You never had a vagina before,” Antonia said, panting.\nThe girls matched each other, their hands reaching down to caress and finger their vaginas as they teased and stroked other parts of their bodies. They stood together in a triangle in the pool, facing each other. The water bubbled from the hot air vents around them; the water lapping at Maja’s belly button, Antonia’s hips, and Valencia’s crotch.\n“I’ve never diddled in front of another girl before,” Maja said breathlessly. “This is so hot!”\n“When I had to do it for clients, I hated it. But this is wonderful! I feel so good,” Antonia agreed. “God, you’re both so beautiful!”\nThey all continued to stroke and pull on their bodies, watching each other as they began to twitch and jerk towards orgasm. They slowly moved closer to one another, their breasts brushing against one another’s arms, breasts, and torsos. They sought as much contact as was possible without stopping the stimulation they gave themselves.\n“You’re getting close, aren’t you?” Antonia asked Valencia.\n“I don’t know,” she answered, her breathing coming in short gasps. “I’ve never done anything like this before.”\n“My breasts feel funny,” Maja said. “But in a good way.”\n“Ummmmmm, mine too,” Antonia said, arching her back so her breasts pressed into both her pod-mates. “Something is happening.”\nThe breast Antonia was pulling on began leaking milk, dripping into the pool. She moaned in pleasure and switched her hands so that she could pull on her other breast while still rubbing her vagina. Soon, her other breast began leaking.\n“That’s so hot,” Maja said, pulling harder on her breasts. “Why won’t mine go?”\n“Relax,” Antonia said. “It’s both physical and mental. Just let it down, you’ll feel it go,” she said, milk now dripping steadily from both of her magnificent breasts.\nMaja bent over and licked some of the milk oozing from Antonia’s breasts. “Ummmm, sweet.”\nShe closed her eyes, and soon her breasts started leaking milk too.\n“That feels so incredible,” Maja said. “So good.”\nValencia’s breasts grew heavier, and she visualized her milk flowing down from her breasts and out her nipples. A spasm in her vagina jerked her hips forward.\n“Ohhh, yessss,” she moaned, keeping her fingers busy. A tiny tingle signaled the start of her milk, her nipples almost painfully erect.\n“Yesssss, it’s started,” she said, her body jerking and twitching, milk dribbling from her nipples.\n“I’m gonna cum,” Maja panted. “I can’t … believe it … never … like … this … before … ahhhhh.”\nMaja groaned out her orgasm, her breasts suddenly spraying milk into the pool.\n“Oh … gooooooodddddd,” Antonia said, her fingers furiously working her crotch.\nAntonia looked up, caught Valencia’s eyes, and both watched each other’s orgasms erupt. Antonia yipped and squealed as her orgasm overtook her body, mermaid milk flowing from her breasts. Valencia groaned as a column of pleasure rose up from her womb, shaking her torso back and forth, and her shoulders jerking forwards and back as each spasm raced through her body. Milk sprayed from their breasts, covering everyone in a fine mist of white.\nThey collapsed into a group hug, sinking into the water up to their necks, their bodies still jerking and twitching from the powerful echoes of their orgasms. They spent a few minutes kissing each other, moving from one pair of lips to the other, sometimes all three pressing their lips and intertwining their tongues together. As their passion cooled, they moved over to one side of the pool, Antonia’s back to the wall and Maja and Valencia pressed against her.\n“Oh, my gosh, that was amazing,” Maja said, resting her head on Antonia’s upper breast. “I’ve never felt anything like that … ever.”\n“Best experience ever,” Antonia agreed.\n“We’re bonded,” Valencia said in a whisper. “I can feel it.”\nAll three girls closed their eyes, savoring the connection that had grown between them, like an invisible tug pulling on their hearts and heads, sharing the heat of one another’s skin as they rested against each other. They stayed that way for a few minutes.\n“Are we done?” Valencia asked.\n“Nope, just catching our breath,” Antonia said. “We have time. Harold won’t be back for at least a half hour.”\n“Good,” Valencia said.\n“Well?” Antonia asked her. “Do you feel like you lost your manhood?”\n“No!” Valencia said, wrapping her legs around Antonia’s right leg, pressing her still quivering crotch against her thigh. “I’ve gained … I can’t begin to tell you.” She kissed Antonia passionately. “I feel so (kiss) wonderful, so (kiss) alive, so (long kiss) loved,” she said in between kisses. She kissed Maja, feeling her body pressing against these two lovely creatures.\n“I just don’t want to stop,” Valencia said, kissing her way down Maja’s neck to her breasts that still dripped milk.\n“Then don’t,” Maja said, pushing her breasts into Valencia’s kisses.\n“Harold won’t know what hit him,” Antonia said.\nBonnie was again on duty at the computer when a sailboat approached from the eastern shore, the rising sun glancing off its battered and worn mast as it neared. Jack recognized it as one of the locals, but he was surprised when Kyle Johnson stepped off the boat and waved good-bye to whomever it was that had ferried him across. Jack wondered what Kyle must have told him about why his own boat was on the island.\n“Looks like the storm has temporarily passed,” Jack said, reaching over to the controls for the blast door. “I’ll leave the ceiling closed up until I know more about what’s going on. You guys just hang out until I get more information.”\n“Roger that,” Mac said.\n“We will continue to study the flora and fauna of the Chesapeake Bay,” Annette said, scooting over to the computer. “We are NOT going to eat MREs for the rest of our time here.”\n“Roger that,” Bonnie said. “I seem to have lost my taste for those things.”\n“That’s not all you’ve lost,” Joy teased.\n“I haven’t lost anything, as you very well know,” Bonnie said, hefting a breast towards Joy. “I have breasts any time I want them and a cock whenever I ask politely.”\n“You don’t need to ask,” Mac said. “I feel like I’m twenty again!”\nJackson rolled his eyes and turned to face the slowly opening door. “I think I should leave you guys alone for awhile,” he said.\n“Why?” Mac joked. “You’ve been watching us for the past two days and that never bothered us before.”\nJack slipped through the slowly opening door and headed up the passageway. He wasn’t squeamish about sex; he wanted to get away because he didn’t trust himself around the mermaids. God, he was horny. He hadn’t felt that kind of desire … ever! As he marched up the passageway, he resolved that no matter what had happened to Kyle, he wasn’t going to wait any longer than he had to. He was going to become a merman with his own mermaids as soon as possible.\nHe opened the secret door, closed it behind him, resetting the pipe, and then took the stairs two at a time up into the kitchen. He found Kyle sitting at the table, reading a newspaper.\n“Whatcha reading?” he asked, sitting down across the table.\n“Supermarket tabloid,” Kyle answered, lowering it to the table. “Mermaids made the front page,” he said, pushing it across to Jack.\nJack quickly scanned News of the World, seeing the article on the prostitutes in the Philippines. He glanced over the other articles on the front page.\n“Your new friends show you this?” Jack asked.\n“Nope,” Kyle said. “You want some coffee?”\n“Nah,” Jack said.\nHe watched Kyle set up the coffee maker for a fresh pot.\n“You O.K.?” he asked.\n“Me?” Kyle said. “Fine.”\nKyle waved his hand around the room and shrugged his shoulders, and Jack understood. Bugs.\n“Good,” Jack answered. “Do you know what happened to my stuff?”\n“Your computers and such?” Kyle asked.\n“Yup,” Jack said.\n“Nope,” Kyle answered.\n“Maybe I was robbed,” Jack said.\n“Maybe,” Kyle agreed. “Maybe you should call someone.”\n“Who am I gonna call?” Jack asked, smiling as he did.\nKyle paused, sharing the pun with his old friend. “I donno, maybe your old boss in Washington, what’s her name?”\n“Susan?” Jackson asked.\n“Yea, that’s her,” Kyle agreed. “I’d start there.”\nJack walked over to his phone and gave it a good, long look. He picked it up and listened to the dial tone, hearing the extra interference on the line. He nodded to Kyle, and then dialed the number into the phone. After a few rings, someone answered.\n“Hello. Welcome to the technology help desk, how may I help you?” a voice said.\n“Hi, my name is Jackson Baker, and I seem to have a problem with my computer,” he said.\n“What sort of problem are you having?” the voice asked.\n“I can’t be sure,” Jackson said. “But I think the mount point on my hard drive has shifted and data may have been compromised.”\nThere was a pause on the other side. Then, “We’re sorry sir. We are unable to assist you at this time over the phone. Can you be available for a home visit?”\n“I can try,” Jackson said. “I’ve had some unexpected visitors, but I think my schedule is pretty clear now.”\n“Yes, sir. Thank you,” the voice said. “We’re checking into that now.”\nThere was another long pause. Then, “customer service is important to us; might we come by later this afternoon?” the voice asked.\n“As long as it’s just your technicians,” Jack said. “There are some other issues I’m having as well.”\n“Yes, sir. It will be authorized personnel only,” the voice said. “What are your other issues?”\n“I had a custom shortwave access point, and it seems to have been disabled,” Jack said.\n“Thank you sir, just a minute,” the voice answered.\nThere was another, longer pause this time. Then, “We will have our technician bring equipment to test your shortwave access. Are there any other issues we should address at this time?” The voice asked.\n“No thanks, I think that’s got it covered,” Jack answered.\n“Thank you for calling the Technology Help Desk,” the voice answered and clicked off.\nJack hung up the phone and smiled.\n“Well?” Petra asked as her head popped up in the lab pool.\n“She did it!” Phoebe reported while salamandering over to the pool.\nPat and Galina remained hunched over their computer screens, and several other new machines clicked and whirred throughout the room.\n“And the other girls?” Xing asked, her face emerging next to her podmate.\n“Good transitions,” Phoebe continued. “Levels of siren cells were strong, and Harold will be drinking from his own pod-mates rather than someone else.”\n“It will be too bad to lose Harold’s help up top, but that will be a strong pod, I can tell,” Pat said, lifting her head from her computer.\n“What about bonding?” Petra asked.\n“Well, it starts right away, from the first seconds, it seems,” said Phoebe. “Levels of progesterone increased as soon as they were in proximity to one another, with most of it coming from a group of Type I siren cells that seemed to form a cytoplasmic mass in the upper GI.”\n“You have all that already?” Petra asked.\n“We have excellent, new equipment,” Galina said, lifting her head from a computer near the rear of the lab. “And we work quickly.”\n“And you’re the smartest mers I know,” Petra said, smiling. Her face changed as a tingle shivered up her mer senses.\n“Um, wait a sec,” Petra said, ducking under the water.\nA few seconds later, she resurfaced, holding Michelle.\n“Trevor’s pod is back!” Petra said. “And they want to speak with all of us right away.”\n“It had better be important,” Galina groused, staring at the data on her screen.\n“Do you want to stay?” Pat asked, knowing how dedicated her fellow scientist was to her work.\n“The subroutines will continue to collect and back data up as it comes in,” Galina said, punching a few keys. “Petra is teaching me the value of family over work.” She smiled at her sister-wife.\n“We’re getting to be a bigger and bigger family every day,” Pat sighed, punching a few keys of her own.\n“We’ll meet on the beach, the moon pool is getting crowded,” John said, popping up in the lab pool. “Danni and the kids are already on their way.”\n“She’s going to let them swim all that way?” Pat asked, worried.\n“No, we’ll catch up with them before they get much past the main entrance,” John said, smiling at Pat’s attack of maternal worry. “Mermaid taxi service will take them around the island and into the lagoon.”\n“Oh, right, of course,” said Pat shuffling towards the pool. “Well, what are we waiting for, let’s go.”\nShe dove into the pool and headed down the softly glowing tunnel. The other mers followed, Phoebe and John catching up to Pat as she entered the Moon Pool. The large pool was empty, a long shaft of light from the early evening sun played along the cave ceiling, and the mers continued through to the main tunnel. Here, they could swim four abreast, and before they reached the main entrance out into the sea, they caught up to Danni and the three children.\n[This is an urchin,] Danni said, pointing to the small creature attached to tunnel wall. [Careful, ouchy.]\nThe three tiny mermaids peered closely at the dark, spiny creature but withheld their inquisitive fingers from the spikes waving in the water. The mers had discovered that although the baby mermaids still lacked language, their mer senses allowed them to feel caution, fear, joy, and other emotions from their parents.\n[There’s my girl,] Pat said, scooping up Maureen, the tiny mermaid squealing with surprise.\n[Get ready for a trip!] she said to her daughter, marveling how the child understood immediately to plaster herself along her mother’s stomach, her head nestled between Pat’s breasts, as her mother started swimming out into the open sea.\nPhoebe and Danni collected their daughters and John moved ahead to the tip of their diamond formation. Pat dropped back to the rear, with Danni on her left and Phoebe on her right. Instinctively the baby mermaids kept themselves tucked within their mother’s draft. John kept the pace slow so that his daughters wouldn’t be ripped from their mothers’ sides, but the mers still swam faster than most humans could normally. Soon, they were in the lagoon. As they approached the beach, they let their daughters loose and they gleefully tumbled in the shallow surf as their mothers salamandered up onto the beach.\nTrevor and his girls were waiting for everyone to assemble. They had already met Michael Thomson and his crew, Emma and the Basras, and they had heard about Harold as his new pod were going to spend the night up in the mountainside huts. Jaclyn and Janice were fawning over Rose, who was blushing from all the attention.\n“Where’s the rest of Eric’s pod?” Trevor asked looking around.\n“Up the mountain setting up the new uplink,” Liga said. “I wish my mer senses worked in the air.”\n“We’re finally getting one with enough bandwidth for full telecom connections?” Ann asked.\n“Yes,” Pat answered. “Someday, you’ll be able to video chat with old friends.”\n“Only from the waist up,” Kate said.\n“Not even that,” Ann said, suddenly realizing. “I mean, look at our eyes, Elana would know that something about us has really changed.”\n“Oh, god, that bitch!” Kate exclaimed, thinking of her former college roommate. “Last time I saw her, she called me a frigid prude.”\n“Those are two words that could never describe you,” Ann confirmed as she leaned in for a sensual kiss.\n“Thanks,” Kate agreed allowing her fingers to brush across Ann\u0026rsquo;s tail, teasing the fringes on her hip fins as she pulled away.\nAnn shuddered at the attention, “Oh, god! Can you imagine what she’d think if she saw us now?”\n“Well, maybe someday you’ll get to find out, but first, we’re going to find out what’s happening with Mac and Joy,” Jaclyn said. “And we can talk about who you might be allowed to talk to and why. We’re not going to be able to keep ourselves secret forever, and we’re going to need friends and allies.”\n“Speaking of friends and allies, that’s why I wanted to make a general report,” Trevor said. “But how much longer will Eric, Sally, and Alexis be? I don’t want to have to repeat myself.”\n“You won’t have to repeat anything,” Liga said. “We’re pod-mates, remember? I’ll be able to share every nuance if necessary. Out with it!”\n“Oh, right, I forgot,” said Trevor. “So, yea, we rescued some people.”\n“What?” Pat asked.\n“Where are they? What do they know? What did you do? Why did you do it?” Several mermaids and mermen all asked at once.\n“We did what was right,” Rose said, defensively.\n“I’m sure you did,” Pat said. “We’re just nervous. Let’s everyone settle down, and let them explain what happened.”\nRose then launched into the tale of their trip, how they had set The Device and became pregnant without realizing what she was doing. She then explained how they came upon the wreckage and discovered the raft, found the four humans near death, towed them to an atoll, and then decided the only way to save them was to feed them mermaid milk. She explained who they were, and what their personalities were like, while she and her sister-wives speculated on what might be the possible outcomes.\n“Josh and Jenna seemed very excited about becoming mers, but the other two didn’t,” Rose said.\n“Yea, that older woman, Sarah, seemed particularly put off by everything,” Kate said. “She was like totally, take me back to my job, pronto!”\n“But all of them drank from you, right?” Pat asked.\n“Yes,” Rose answered. “Josh and Jenna from me …”\n“And you’re pregnant,” Pat said.\n“Yes,” Trevor answered. “Her signal changed.”\n“And Kate and I fed the other two,” Ann said.\n“And you’re not pregnant,” Pat said.\n“Not yet,” Kate said, blushing.\n“Are they going to be alright?” Rose asked. “I mean should we go back and get them?”\n“Well, first, we really need to find out what’s happened to Mac and Joy,” Pat said. “I assume that they made the transition safely, which suggests that your original plan to let nature take its time might be the best for Josh’s pod in the long run. If Sarah and the other girl …”\n“Manami,” Rose said.\n“Manami, needs someone to blame, it can be me,” Pat finished.\nThe sound of something coming through the jungle interrupted their conversation.\n“I hope that’s Eric’s pod,” John said, eyeing the jungle as dusk approached. “Why aren’t they coming down the path?”\nAfter a few seconds, the crashing got louder, and Eric and Sally emerged from the jungle about twenty meters north of the path, covered in debris.\n“Hey guys!” Eric said, beaming.\n“Where’s Alexis and Peter?” Pat asked.\n“They’re coming down the path,” Sally said. “Eric wanted to try some bushwhacking.”\n“What’s bushwhacking?” Rangi asked.\n“Nothing fun,” Mae said.\n“Bushwhacking is making a path where none yet exists,” Bill explained to his other mate. “You whack at the bushes in your way, marching through the jungle. When we go through a seaweed forest underwater, you could say that we are weed whacking.”\n“Now that is funny,” Eric said. “We’re going to do that next time!”\n“It was a blast, wasn’t it?” Sally agreed.\nEric turned and got his first look at his mate since they emerged from the jungle. Tangled in her hair were bits of leaves, and a fine layer of grit covered every part of her. She pointed to a twig dangling in his hair and giggled. He stifled a laugh, unsuccessfully, and together he and Sally burst out laughing.\n“Next time you go second and get all those branches in your face,” Sally said her laughter abating. “Let’s get clean!”\nThey both raced through the bemused crowd towards the water and plowed into the gentle surf.\n“Mind the children!” Danni shouted.\nThey disappeared beneath the waves and then circled around, rushing back up onto the beach. The water leapt from their hydrophobic bodies, leaving them pristine, their hair clean, thick, and flowing down their shoulders, just like the rest of the mers on the beach.\n“That is a useful trick,” Emma observed. “I wish that happened with human children,” she said with a look at her children.\n“Ha, ha, ha,” the triplets replied in near unison.\n“Well, is everything working?” Pat asked.\n“Of course!” Eric answered. “Peter was a great help too. I’ll bet he’s going to be really useful when you finally get him down in your lab. The man has a great mind, sees things so clearly.”\n“I believe the plan is to get HER down in the lab in the next few days,” Michael said.\n“Oh, yea, he did mention something about that to Alexis,” Eric said. “Apparently you have to be a girl to be a scientist in this society.”\n“James is a scientist,” Debra said proudly. “He is one of the world’s foremost geneticists.”\n“Well, that might have been the case, but lately I’ve tried to approach science from an applied point of view, thanks to you all,” James said, indicating Elise and Bridget. “Perhaps after I’ve mastered the fundamental biological structures of mers and what’s possible as medical interventions, I’ll return to my study of genetics. Besides, Galina and Alexis are far ahead of me on morphologies of siren cell DNA.”\n“I hate it when they start speaking in a different language,” Eric said.\n“Don’t change the subject! What’s wrong with being a girl?” Sally asked.\n“Nothing,” Eric protested. “I love girls.”\n“You’d better. Now, let’s get back to the lab and try to raise my father,” Sally said. “It’s this morning there.”\n“I can never understand how you keep track of times so easily,” Danni said.\n“It’s a navy thing,” Sally said.\n“It’s a military thing,” Mark said.\n“Sorry to ask for this call so early, but it’s an emergency,” Jaclyn explained into the computer.\n“It’s fine, but I have to figure out how to get the video working,” Bart Kolbert’s voice said from the computer. “I can hear you just fine, though. What’s the problem? Did you get the shipment? Wait, you’re talking to me over the Internet, of course you got the shipment!”\n“Yes, we got everything, thanks! But we can’t raise Jackson Baker or anyone else out east,” Jaclyn explained. “We’ve never had this problem before.”\n“Oh, yes, I think I can shed some light there, but it’s not good,” Bart said.\nSally gasped and grabbed Eric’s arm.\n“I got an email from Mr. Baker about two days ago, and he said that his home was being raided by security forces, probably from the National Security Agency or the Pentagon,” Bart said.\n“Oh, no!” Sally said.\n“He didn’t offer any details but explained that he was sealing himself and the four mers in an underground bunker, and that he would send word when he could,” Bart continued. “I’ve not heard from him yet either.”\n“The four mers?” Pat asked. “He said four mers? Does that mean that they all finally transitioned? God, wish we could get data from them! Is everyone alright? Did they transition safely?”\n“I don’t know,” Bart said. “I’ve literally told you everything I know. I’ve taken steps to prepare myself to be brought in for questioning, but so far, nothing.”\n“Well, that’s at least good,” Jaclyn said. “What plans have you made, and what should we be doing on this end?”\n“Just a minute,” Bart Kolbert’s voice said from the computer speakers. “I’ll reboot the video.”\nThe screen flickered and then his image appeared on the screen, he was sitting in his office in San Francisco, the early morning sun just visible in the window behind him.\n“We can see you! Can you see me?” Jaclyn asked.\n“Not yet … no, wait,” he was obviously trying to fix the settings on his computer. “There!”\nJaclyn smiled as she watched Bart’s face go slack. It took a good ten seconds, and she just smiled and let him gape at her.\n“Here, look,” she said, reaching forward to the tiny camera, watching the chat window to make sure the camera was going where she wanted.\nShe panned the camera down her body, where her hair modestly covered her breasts for the first video chat with her lawyer, down along her green and gold tail with one of her mid-tail-fins flapping, finally to her large flukes, which she curled up in a mermaid wave of “hello.” She turned the camera to Janice, who gave Bart a smile, and then panned across the lab where Eric’s pod waited and then over to the pool, where the rest of the other mers bobbed in the water. She returned the camera to her own face and invited Pat into the view.\n“This is Pat,” Jaclyn explained. “You’ve already spoken to her before.”\nThe two mermaids waited a few more seconds for Bart to recover, and he did, shaking himself and sitting up straight.\n“Well,” he said in a girlishly high pitch.\nHe cleared his throat, stretched his chin forward, and began again.\n“Well,” he said in his normal baritone. “I thought I had an idea about what we ought to do, but now I’m not so sure.”\n“What was your idea?” Pat asked.\n“I thought we’d ask one of the big morning news anchors to fly out and ‘discover’ you guys,” Bart said. “We’d use the world-wide publicity to protect the MMI from being overwhelmed by those who would do us ill, but now I’m not so sure.”\n“Why?” Pat asked.\n“Because you all are so beautiful,” Bart said, as if he was offering an obviously conclusive argument.\n“Why would being beautiful compromise your plan?” Pat asked.\n“Anyone who can afford transportation to Mermaid Island will head your way,” Bart said. “I didn’t realize what you guys looked like. When people find out they can become “like” you, it’s all over. People will come from every corner of the globe.”\n“Really?” asked Pat.\n“Have you been paying attention to anything?” Phoebe asked, exasperated. “For someone who is the smartest person I know, you can be really dumb. Think about it! Eric, Sally, Trevor, Rose … me?” She paused, letting it sink in. “Has anyone turned us down? Harold, your sister, the Connors? Anyone? He’s right, you know. And when word leaks out that you get younger and live longer, billions of people will want to jump in our pool.”\n“Oh, god!” Pat said, looking around the room, seeing heads nod. “We’d be loved to death.”\n“Something like that,” Bart agreed. “We’re going to have to try to break this story slowly, and with help, and your location will have to be difficult to find. I’ll do everything I can to track down what’s happened to Mr. Baker and the others, and I’ll send you an email, now that you’re fully on-line.”\n“Right,” Pat said, still a bit stunned at the new problems the mers faced.\n“In the meantime, batten down the hatches. I suggest that you start work on two issues: first, some sort of evacuation and dispersion plan should something go really wrong. You’re too attached to one location, right now, and you’ve got to fix that. Second, develop some sort of security for your facilities there, so people can’t wander in and start changing,” Bart said, pausing to sip some water. “We’re in for a bumpy ride, folks.”\n“I’m beginning to see that,” Pat agreed.\n“What about Russia?” Galina asked.\n“What about Russia,” Pat said.\n“We maybe should make more than one connection and try to get big powers to protect us?” Galina said in her Russian accent. “Once key scientific peoples understand The Device, your country, mine, and Xing’s will do all they can to protect us.”\n“Up to a point,” Bart said. “They aren’t going to do anything for free, even (or especially) if it is in their own self interest. You’re going to have to be able to offer some carrots along with your big stick.”\n“We have carrots,” Galina said. “Lots of carrots.”\n“Give me an example,” Bart suggested.\n“A sea anemone that eats human and animal waste in boundary waters in bays and estuaries. Sea grasses that make freshwater rivers and lakes cleaner. Algae that absorbs and sequesters pollution, bacteria that treat sewage seven times faster and one hundred times better than traditional methods. A solar-powered, bioengineered water desalination process that is capable of producing enough fresh water for London each day. The ability to speed up the biological carbon pump in the ocean, thus offsetting the rate of carbon release by human activity, and finally, all kinds of medical cures, that for the moment, we can only speculate,” Pat said. “How’s that?”\n“Good. Those are some pretty good carrots,” Bart admitted. “I like the scientific angle; it gets the story out of the tabloids and into something everyone can respect. You guys let me know who needs to be contacted in what countries, and I’ll arrange for a video tele-summit. It looks as if the MMI is about to have its first international conference way ahead of schedule.”\n“I was hoping we wouldn’t have to go this route,” Jaclyn said. “But I guess I was naive.”\n“Maybe someday,” Bart said. “Don’t give up on the dream you outlined in Appendix T. It’s a worthy dream. Keep it.”\n“Thanks, Bart,” Jaclyn said. “So, does that mean that are you tempted to join us, especially now that you’ve seen us?”\nBart smiled, expecting the question.\n“No,” he said. “But I might have to come for a visit.”\nHarold couldn’t help himself, he had to watch, if only for a little while. As the three beautiful women who were destined to become his pod-mates brought one another to repeated, earth shaking orgasms, Harold counted his blessings. His journey started in a small town in Kansas, with abusive and rigid parents, his older sister a hated lesbian, and then he ran away to a life as far away from Kansan as possible, as a merchant marine. He was useful there because he was handy and small, so he could often fix things other crewmembers could not. But that jealousy was probably the reason why for being pushed overboard.\nHe remembered being sure he was going to die on that soggy container box, and he shivered. Then came the miraculous appearance of these even more miraculous creatures, and now he was about to be joined in a mer marriage to three beautiful young women, each of whom had come to this moment through hell and hardship. Maja’s cry as she reached another orgasm roused him from his reverie. He waited until her yelps subsided before he walked towards them.\n“Finally!” Antonia said, turning towards him.\n“Somebody pinch me,” Harold said with a grin, his swim trunks taut across his engorged penis.\nValencia tapped her sister wife and the three of them huddled in the pool, their heads pressed together as they whispered. Finally, Antonia stood up.\n“Go back to the hut, take off your clothes, lie on the big bed in the main hut, and close your eyes,” she ordered.\n“Your wish is my command,” Harold answered, turning smartly on his heel and marching back down the path towards the hut.\nValencia and her sister wives watched their soon-to-be-mate walk away from them. As soon as he was out of sight, they waded out of the pool and let the water evaporate from their bodies, the late afternoon sun warming them. Valencia imitated both Maja and Antonia, pulling her hair from behind her and squeezing the water out with her fist. All three of them then combed their hair with their fingers, trying to get it to dry faster.\n“I never had hair this thick before,” Maja said.\n“I never had hair that wouldn’t tangle,” Antonia said. “I can’t believe how well behaved mermaid hair actually is.”\n“I never had long hair,” Valencia said, running her fingers through the thick, silky strands, enjoying the slight tug on her scalp.\n“Just be glad it’s almost mermaid hair, if you were just a regular girl, getting out of hard water, like that rocky pool, would mean that you’d have a tangled mess for hours,” Antonia said.\n“Watching you two is getting me horny again,” Maja said.\n“I haven’t stopped being horny,” Valencia said. “I can’t believe how good everything feels. My hair, my fingers going through my hair, the weight of my breasts against my chest, the wonderful ache between my legs … God! It all feels so damn good.”\nAntonia shook her head, her quickly drying hair now starting to gain body. She looked at Maja and Valencia’s efforts and admired the way their breasts bobbled as they combed their long hair.\n“Shake it out, see how dry it is,” she suggested. Both girls did, and Maja marveled at how quickly her hair had dried.\n“I think that’s good,” Antonia said. “Pat said there’d be food in the kitchen hut, so let’s go there first. Hang on for a sec.”\nAntonia grabbed the relay box, and Maja started down the path, then Antonia, and Valencia brought up the rear. Antonia’s rolling hips riveted Valencia, her full, round globes wobbling as she walked, her slender waist like the top of a pendulum. Valencia looked down at her own hips, noticing that she too had a rolling gait, and she put her hands on her hipbones, watching as each went up and down as she walked. Her breasts swung on her chest too, and she loved the way they bounced slightly as she moved. Soon, they arrived at the huts and saw Harold’s fee through the door to the main hut as they went by.\n“Don’t move,” Antonia sang out.\nThe girls went into the kitchen hut and saw the dried fish, some fruit, and leafy greens that had been left for them. There were also several canteens of water. They gathered the food and brought it into the main hut where Harold lay. Antonia also grabbed an old rag that was nearby and handed it to Maja.\n“Don’t move,” Antonia warned, as she placed the relay box on the windowsill while Maja tied the rag on him like a blindfold. “First we eat, and then you eat.”\nThe girls showered Harold with the food, softly raining down bits and pieces of fresh fruit, greens, and small pieces of fish. When they had exhausted the supply and he was lightly covered with food, they opened a canteen and passed it among them, drinking deeply. Then they eased onto the bed with Harold and began nuzzling his body, eating from his skin.\n“Oh, god,” he said. “This is so cool, but why do I have to be blindfolded?”\n“It’s part of the experiment,” Antonia said. “Now hush.”\nHarold tried to relax, but between the memory of how beautiful the girls looked and the soft caresses of their lips as they ate, and the occasional breast that pressed to his leg or dragged across his arm, he could not.\nValencia noticed Harold having a smell she never noticed before, not in anyone. Of course, she reminded herself, she hadn’t ever put her nose this close to a man before. The smell was salty and musky, like the earth of the jungle floor after rain. The smell intensified the closer she drew to his crotch where his erection throbbed on his stomach. Her face unexpectedly pressed into Maja’s as they both went after the same morsel of fish just north of his penis on his belly. Maja won the morsel, and Valencia paused to smell her. Her sister-wife smelled lighter, spicier, less musky, and she was glad when she felt her body react to that smell too.\n“That was wonderful,” Antonia said as they finished. “Now, we’re going to feed you, and we’ll have a bit of dessert while you try to figure out who is doing what to you. No peeking from under the blindfold and don’t move a muscle.”\n“Promise,” Harold said, his eyes shut, his arms at his side.\nAntonia got on all fours and positioned her breasts over Harold’s face. “Drink,” she said, pressing her nipple into his mouth.\nAs Harold began to feed, Maja began kissing his feet, working her way up his legs. Valencia started on his pecs, lavishing attention on his nipples and working her way down his torso. By the time they both reached his cock, Antonia switched breasts. Harold moaned into her breast when Maja slowly slid her lips over his cock, giving him several good strokes. She then lifted her head and presented his cock to Valencia.\nShe leaned down, giving it a kiss, wondering what would her father think of her now? She licked the tip and then slid her lips down around the crown, flicking her tongue across the top. Harold moaned appreciatively. She gave a few quick, hard strokes with her lips too, and then switched places with Antonia.\nAs Harold’s lips found her stiff nipple, a flood of hormones washed through her body. Her milk let down, and her other nipple dripped milk on to Harold’s neck. Valencia couldn’t keep silent, despite their plan, and sighed with contentment, wishing she could lift Harold’s head into her lap and feed him like that for hours. Antonia and Maja continued to caress and suck on his cock as he fed.\nWhen he finished with Valencia, Maja took her place, and Antonia indicated that she should straddle his waist. Valencia smiled, ready for this last barrier to her womanhood to be broken. She lifted herself over him as Antonia held his cock upright. She reached down and pulled back her labia, aiming her new opening at the top of his cock while Antonia held his cock steady. A spasm jerked her hips as the excitement of what she was about to do erupted across her abdomen. She steadied herself, and then slowly lowered herself down onto his cock.\nThe maidenhead she was expecting never materialized, and she slid down his cock in one, smooth motion. She fought the urge to vocalize and savored the incredible and alien experience of being stretched open and filled with a foreign object. When she bottomed out, she looked quizzically at her sister-wives. Antonia shrugged in return and indicated she should get on with it. Valencia chafed at the no moaning restriction imposed by Antonia’s little game, but she complied.\nCareful not to dislodge Maja, who was nearly done breastfeeding, Valencia slowly raised and lowered herself on Harold’s cock, rolling her hips as she bottomed out on each stroke, forcing her clit to rub on Harold’s pubic bone. She couldn’t help gasping as she did, and Antonia solved that problem by grabbing Harold’s hand and stuffing it into her crotch, causing her to gasp too. When Maja finished, she grabbed the other hand, and soon all three girls were gasping and cooing.\nHarold was in heaven. Between the power of the mermaid milk coursing through his body, strengthening and energizing him, and the erotic gyrations of his three soon-to-be-pod-mates, he felt like he could go on forever. His hopes were dashed, however, as the erotic energy began to build, each of his girls thundering towards their first orgasms with him. He had no idea who was who, and didn’t feel the need to try to figure it out. He just enjoyed the wonderful tension building in his balls as the three girls stroked, jerked, gasped, and moaned their way towards their orgasms.\nThe two girls he was furiously fingering both erupted first, and he felt the warm spray of milk rain down upon him. His cock stiffened further as his own orgasm rushed forward, and he erupted into whoever was on top of him just as her hips ground out an orgasm on his cock, moving in quick, sharp, circles with accompanying grunts. He kept his eyes closed as each girl disentangled herself from him, and then after a moment he heard a voice.\n“You can open them now,” Antonia said.\nHarold pulled off his blindfold and opened his eyes, blinking. He raised his head and saw all three girls, their arms locked around each other, standing at the foot of the bed. All three shared a freshly fucked glow, their smiles wide and relaxed.\n“Which one of us did what?” Antonia asked.\n“I have no idea,” Harold answered. “Really, it was impossible to tell, especially since I’ve never even touched any of you before. Why did we play that particular game?”\n“Pat wants to find out when the earliest bonding happens,” Antonia explained. “How soon your mer organs begin to form and when they might come on line. So, you have to try to sense which of us is doing what based on your bonds rather than your eyes.”\n“Oh,” Harold said. “So, we’re going to do this again?”\n“Probably several more times,” Antonia said.\n“Perfect,” Harold said, pulling his hands up under his head and crossing his feet. “You just let me know when you’re ready.”\n“Close your eyes,” Maja said, breaking free of her sisterly embrace and coming around the bed.\nHarold snapped his eyes shut, tied the blindfold back on, and threw his arms back down at his sides, and thanks to the siren cells already at work in his body, his cock immediately showed signs of new life.\n“So, what are you going to do with The Johanna?” Liz asked, getting ready to depart the boat for the last time.\nMichael Thompson looked over the boat named for his deceased wife, thinking about the plans he had made for this moment. He smiled at Liz, wondering for the umpteenth time what she would look like restored to health, youth, and her legs. She was a handsome and strong willed woman, and Michael realized that she would likely exert far more influence in his pod than he first imagined. No matter, a strong woman was never a problem, he reminded himself, thinking back to Johanna herself. No, the only problem was an unreasonable woman.\nHe glanced back inside the boat to where Peter and Leonard were preparing to leave the boat for the last time. The Johanna was an empty shell. They had scavenged most of the equipment and furniture. The electronic equipment was mostly up at the mountainside huts, giving any humans who might stay there radio access to the caves below them. The beds too were now up at the huts, and the rest of the equipment and materials were in the caves for further re-adaptation into mer useful items. They even removed the engine, broke it down into parts, and carted the remains up to the mountainside huts for further reuse.\n“We’re going to tow her to the far side of the shelf, along the southeastern edge of the island, and sink her in about 10 meters of water,” he explained. “She’ll be an artificial reef and perhaps a refuge for us when the Moon Pool gets to be crowded.”\n“Won’t that be a bit like a mausoleum?” she asked.\n“Depends on your point of view,” Michael said. “My wife’s ashes were spread over the ocean, but that was outside Hong Kong, and I named her so that our sons would have something tangible representing their mother that kept them safe and afloat.”\n“Now why am I finding out what a sensitive and nice man you are at this late date?” she asked with a smile.\n“Business is business,” he said with a laugh.\n“I’ll keep that in mind when we seek refuge in this empty boat,” Liz said.\n“Well, we really won’t need much once we’re mers,” Michael said. “We’ll just float in the stateroom. Furniture would just get in the way.”\n“Yea, I suppose you’re right,” Liz said. “We’ll have air bladders and much more besides, won’t we?”\n“Yes,” Michael said. “You looking forward to it?”\n“Absolutely,” Liz declared. “I can’t wait to be free of this chair, and I have to admit that the mers are beautiful, graceful people. Who wouldn’t want to join them?”\n“I suppose there are many,” Michael said. “But I’m not terribly interested in knowing any of those people. What do you think about our assignment?”\n“Well, I didn’t have any preconceived notions of how I was going to change or bond or whatever these mers do,” Liz said, brushing back a strand of gray hair that had broken free. “And I’ve valued any independence I can get, so being alone for the first stage of feedings is fine by me. It might be hard on Peter and Leonard.”\n“Why do you think so?” Michael asked.\n“Well, Valencia needed the extra push from the other girls to start a Type II chain reaction,” Liz said. “Peter is pretty eager to get started towards being the girl that he’s imagined since puberty. So, if he can’t do it on his own, he’ll have to wait until the second day.”\n“And Len?” Michael asked.\n“I understand the need for keeping him in the dark,” Liz said. “But I can’t gage how invested Len is on the surrender aspect. I feel like my role in this experiment is a little bit like that girl in high school, the one who is nice to the nerd so that he can be publicly humiliated.”\n“I guess I can see that,” Michael admitted. “But I have to admit that I kind of like it; it has a certain kink, you know?”\n“I never thought I’d admit this to another man, usually it’s a girltalk -thing, but you’re right, it does have a certain kink to it,” Liz admitted. “Now Michael, I really don’t want to be this old crippled lady any longer, so if you could please help me into the water, we can start on our journey.”\nShe lifted her hands up and put them around his neck as he picked her up. She rested her head against his shoulder as he walked over the back railing and stepped down to the aft swimming deck. He set her down so that she sat facing the beach with her withered and useless legs in the water. She gave him a quick peck on the cheek.\n“Next time I see you I’ll be a lot prettier, and I’ll give you a much better kiss,” she said.\n“I’ll count the days,” he said.\nShe slipped off the deck and into the arms of Trixi, who guided her onto her back. Mark’s pod was going to be feeding and tending to her for the next eighteen hours. He watched as they made their way across the northeast arm of the lagoon towards the new shelter they had erected there. Liz’s gray head was visible as she hung onto Trixi’s shoulders.\n“All set?” Peter asked as he stepped down onto the swimming deck.\n“Nearly,” Michael said. “Captain always leaves last, you know.”\n“Right, of course,” Peter said. “Well, I hope to be a lot different the next time we meet!”\n“Me too,” Michael said with a grin. “I think you’re a great guy and all, but I don’t think you’d make a good pod-mate in your current state.”\nPeter scanned the beach until he spotted Eric’s pod. Sally was making her way to the boat while the rest of her pod waited in the shallow surf. “There’s my ride,” he said as he stepped off into the water. “It’s going to be lovely to be young again.”\n“You’re going to be lovely,” Michael said. “I can’t wait to see how you turn out.”\n“I hope you like my surprise,” Peter said. “See you tomorrow!”\nMichael saluted as Sally collected Peter and they started back for the main beach where Peter would begin his transition. Peter would be having mother’s milk from Liga and Alexis to gain as much power as possible for his effort to go female completely solo. Michael turned and watched as Leonard made his way towards the aft deck, fumbling with briefcase.\n“Whatcha got there?” Michael asked.\n“Notes, scribblings, stuff,” Len said. “Who knows, someday I might have to start writing legal stuff down. I wanted to start my own record of how things go, how they operate around here. Maybe it will be useful someday.”\n“Lucy the Mermaid Scribe,” Michael said.\n“Yea, I guess so,” Len said with an awkward smile. He started. “Did you just name me?”\n“I believe I did,” Michael said. “What do you think?”\n“Um … the book, right?” Len said.\n“Yes, the children’s book,” Michael said. “A fitting name for a scribe, one that comes from a book?”\n“Sure,” Len said. “I sure wish I knew more about what was happening here. I seem to be the only one who doesn’t know exactly what’s going to happen and when.”\n“I know,” Michael said in a comforting manner. “It’s part of the experiment. It can’t be helped. You’ll be fine.”\n“Yea, but I really wanted to end up looking like …” he said.\n“Kelly Brook,” Michael interrupted. “Yes, I know. Don’t worry, it will work out. We will be together, after all, when we transition to mers. We can tweak you then if necessary.”\n“Right, I guess so,” Len said, feeling unsure.\n“Look, there’s Tuo’s pod,” Michael said, pointing to the approaching mers. “I’ll see you late tomorrow.”\n“Well, that’s a timeline at least,” said Len with a smile.\n“Ready?” Eve asked.\n“Sure,” Len said. “Um, can one of you take this in and keep it dry?”\n“No problem,” Sandi said, rising on her tail, her impressive body on display as she took the briefcase and sank back into the water, holding the slim case aloft.\nLen watched as the beautiful mermaid rose up before him, her body a perfect mixture of allure, mystery, and beauty. That used to be a man, Len thought to himself. I’m going to change like that. Holy shit.\n“Len?” Michael asked, seeing him mesmerized.\n“Right, sorry,” said Len as he slipped into the water, and held onto Eve’s shoulders, her beautiful body moving beneath him.\nMichael watched as that pod headed for the southeast side of the lagoon to a shelter also newly built for this experiment. He sat down on his boat, alone, and waited. The boat was to be his solitary outpost, and soon several mermaids, each alone, would visit him to insure that he youthened without the influence of any others. It was going to be a long eighteen hours, he thought to himself, but he had come this far and waited this long.\nLeonard Simon tried to shake the feeling that Tuo was watching him, but it was difficult. The stern, silent merman intimidated him, and even though he was out in the lagoon with the rest of his pod, Len still worried.\n“I won’t bite,” Sandi said, misinterpreting Len’s hesitation. “You’re supposed to get started tonight.”\n“Yes, well, er … yes,” said Len looking over at the beautiful mermaid who was to be his first feeder.\nSandi’s effortless sexuality unnerved him. She was blond, perky, and built like a proverbial brickshithouse, and that was exactly the type of woman that threw him. Well, any gorgeous woman could do it, but blond and perky was more than enough at the moment. His eyes shifted back to the lagoon, searching for any sign of the rest of Sandi’s pod.\n“Oh, has Tuo got you worried?” Sandi said, her voice peeling like a silver bell. “Oh, my, that’s funny. Don’t worry; he is like that with everyone. Trust me; he’s not jealous or anything. Besides, this is how mermaids work. You’ll understand in a few days.”\n“He didn’t say two words to me,” Len said.\n“Sometimes, that’s a good thing,” Sandi said, lifting her hair over her shoulder, exposing one of her perfect breasts. “Now, come on over here and get your medicine, like a good boy.”\n“Why is it that beautiful women always seem to infantilize men?” Leonard asked more to himself than as a serious question to the mermaid sitting on the beach waiting for him.\n“Because you all like it that way,” Sandi said, laughing. “I should know. I used to be one myself. According to my sister-wife, Dawn, the men who aren’t easily transformed into little boys within the first ten seconds of meeting a girl aren’t worth spit. They tend to be arrogant assholes. What’s worse, when they finally get you in bed, they are littler little boys than the rest of them combined. They’re like two year olds, only worse. Two year olds grow up, eventually.” She laughed.\nLen laughed too, remembering some of the bigger assholes he knew when he was young. That seemed to do the trick, and the tension he felt evaporated. He walked over to her and knelt down beside her.\n“What should I do?” he asked, feeling awkward.\n“Just turn around and put your head in my lap, that’s easiest,” she said.\n“Won’t that put me in a subordinate position to you?” he asked.\n“All that talk of hormones and submission got you worried?” she asked. He just blushed. “Well, that purple pill you swallowed will tell us more, but Pat’s pretty sure that bonded sets of mermaids are not able to inadvertently bond new mates. Now, if I happened to be part of a pod with one open slot for a mermaid, that would be a different story. You’re just going to go through stage one, nice and easy, just with the girls from our pod.”\n“And then after that?” Len asked, trying to pump her for more information.\n“You’ll have to wait and see,” She said.\n“It’s part of the experiment,” they said in unison.\n“Yeah, I know,” said Len. “You can’t blame a guy for trying.”\n“No, I suppose not,” Sandi agreed. “Now will you flip over? This is my first time feeding and I’ve been looking forward to it. It’s supposed to be different from just making love to your pod-mates, but no one can seem to describe it for me.”\n“I suppose that feeding me will be really different once you decide to have a mermaid of your own,” Len said, thinking about that possibility for himself.\n“Well, I won’t be able to compare the experiences if I don’t have this one!” She said, smiling but insistent. “Now, will you please flip over?”\nHe began to turn, and then hesitated.\n“What’s it like?” he asked, looking down her body.\n“Mer or girl?” Sandi asked, her mer senses telling her what Len was feeling.\n“Both,” Len asked. “I know how you and Tuo started, which is one reason for the experiments with Peter and I, but … I still wonder if I’m making …” he said.\n“The right decision?” she finished. “Well, you’re going into this knowing you’ll end up female. I didn’t. But, I have to say that three months later, almost to the day, I can hardly remember being a guy.”\n“So, it’s good?” Len asked.\n“It’s more than good,” Sandi said, a shiver running through her body. “It’s amazing to feel someone else inside you, and I mean that both physically, like when Tuo has me speared like a tuna on a trident, and emotionally, when I can feel Eve and Dawn’s love inside my own body, my connection to them is glowing with energy.”\nSandi’s eyes seemed to become wider as she spoke, her passion and her love for her mates opening up her innermost self for viewing. Len labored to restrain himself, every fiber in his body wanting to take this beautiful creature into his arms, thrusting into her, making her his own. Sandi sensed his rising passion and took a few deep breaths of her own.\n“You’ll get the love you desire, just not from me,” she said playfully. “So, just calm your jets, big boy, or we’re not going to get anywhere tonight.”\nLen realized what he was thinking and shook his head.\n“Sorry, I just couldn’t seem to help it,” he said. “Help me understand why I need to be a mermaid and not a merman.”\n“You don’t need to be anything,” Sandi said. “But if you want to be a mermaid, I can tell you that it’s an incredible experience. Not only did I get to keep the love of a woman I adore and love, but also got to have the love and protection of a strong and powerful mate who can make me feel things that I never thought possible. I didn’t have a choice at first, but now I’m pretty sure that it’s the best of both worlds.”\n“Would you choose to do it now, if you could go back?” he asked.\n“Life never lets us do that, so it’s not a fair question,” Sandi said. “However, going forward I choose to stay as I am, which is saying something. I could change back, you know, if something happened to Tuo.”\n“If something did, would you choose to do so, go back to being male?” Len asked.\n“No,” Sandi said, looking over her own body. “I’d stay me, and Eve, Dawn and I would find a new mate, or maybe Eve would become a merman. I don’t know, but I know that Dawn and I would stay just the way we are, twin girls and mates.”\nLen thought about that, and wondered what it would be like to be with a young and beautiful Liz or whatever Peter was going to turn out to be. If he was going to look like Kelly Brook, he bet that Liz was going to be more slender and long. She had an air of Lauren Bacall about her, handsome in her later years. Peter had never talked about it, and so Len didn’t know.\n“So, shall we get started then?” Sandi asked.\nLen nodded and turned his body perpendicular to her and lay back, resting his head on her lap. The texture of her mermaid skin was impossibly soft and smooth, a feature he could feel even with his neck. He looked away from her face and along her tail, feeling her incredibly smooth skin with his cheek. She flicked her flukes up so he could see them, her pale blue and pink tail with yellow highlights shot throughout sparkled in the rays of late evening sunset. He turned back as she reached forward to cradle his head in her arms.\nSandi’s sparkling green eyes smiled down at him, her thick, blond hair falling forward a little as she bent forward. Her large breasts loomed over his face, nearly blocking his view of her eyes, and as he watched, her left breast, the one she was aiming at his face, began to leak milk from the nipple. She brought his head towards her breast, and he instinctively opened his mouth as her stiff nipple touched his lips.\nThe milk tasted so sweet, so amazingly sweet. He thought it might taste like baby formula, and while mermaid milk was thicker than water, it was surprisingly smooth too, like a warm milkshake. He found himself sucking on this perfect breast before he even realized what he was doing. Sandi was making low, humming noises, almost like a sigh of contentment, and her bulging breast pressed into his face, her milk filling his mouth. He idly thought that “this was it; there was no turning back,” but the sensuousness of what he was doing instantly overwhelmed that small flicker of fear.\nHe was tempted to reach around her, to embrace her as he suckled, but the thought of Tuo kept his arms across his stomach. After several minutes of feeding, she lifted her left breast from his mouth and lowered the other onto his face.\n“My, you’re a fast feeder,” she said.\nLen was tempted to say something, but he couldn’t form the words around the right breast that was stuffed into his mouth. He sucked and drank for another five minutes, finally draining her.\n“That was really nice,” she admitted. “I can see why the others like doing it. How do you feel?”\nLen sat up reluctantly, wishing he could remain attached to those wondrous globes for eternity. He took stock of himself, gave his extremities a quick survey, and looked back at Sandi.\n“Fine, I guess,” he said.\n“Well, it’s quick but it’s not instantaneous,” she said. “Dawn will be back for your bedtime snack in a few hours, and we’ll see how you’re doing then. You take care, now, O.K.”\nLen nodded.\n“Good,” she said, swinging her tail away from Len and putting it behind her. She raised herself up on her fins and salamandered back into the water with a backward wave before she ducked under the surface.\nLen looked down at his belly, knowing it was full of mermaid milk. It was also just plain full: big, full, and round. He patted his belly like an old friend and wondered how long before the mermaid milk would “heal” him back to his twenties. He looked forward to being in shape again, and he wondered, again, what it would be like to be as powerfully beautiful as his ideal, as Kelly Brook.\nHe shook his head. Right now, his body was a long, long, way from that ideal.\n“Are your systems fully restored and functional?” Susan Perilli asked, as her emergency technical assistance team finished packing up their equipment.\nJackson Baker nodded, watching the last of the technicians get back onto the boat. They had spent most of the day sweeping the island and restoring his confiscated equipment. Now that everything was up and running, Jackson had activated a series of electronic curtains that restored his privacy, other than the technicians whom he didn’t know and didn’t trust. As the boat pulled away from the dock, he turned to his old boss.\n“It’s safe now. We can talk freely,” he said. “Between your guys and my stuff the island is clean.”\n“Good. I’m sorry you had to be put to all this trouble, Jack,” she said. “If they had just called me, we could have saved the government a lot of time and money.”\n“I’m glad I still have your trust,” Jack said, smiling. “I’m about to see how much trust I can put into you.”\n“Jack, you’re the most boring person I know,” Susan laughed. “I know everything about you from the time you were five, and there’s not a thing you could tell me that would require you to trust me.”\n“It’s about time that I surprised you,” Jack said.\n“It’s not going to make me unhappy, will it?” she asked, scanning the horizon. “You know how I hate to bend rules. I’ve never broken my oath, and I don’t plan on starting now. If I shouldn’t know what you’re about to tell me, don’t.”\n“I’ve always admired your strength of character,” Jack said. “It’s the only reason those crazy hackers actually work for the government. They trust you. I trust you. Others will eventually know what I’m about to share with you, but it will have to be on a need-to-know basis. I wanted you to be the first, and besides Mac wanted you.”\n“Mac?” she asked, the name tugging at her memory. Her brow furrowed as she tried to pull it up. “You don’t mean Admiral Mackenzie Bennett, do you?”\n“You know him?” Jack asked, surprised.\n“No, I never knew him. We got asked to do some checking a few months back,” she explained. “To make sure his sudden retirement wasn’t linked to any sensitive or problematic issues.”\n“Mac?” Jackson asked, stunned. “Investigated? He’s a decorated veteran of three wars!”\n“We check on anyone who has top secret clearance and radically changes their life,” she said. “He was fine, just smitten with one of our own alumni. That actually happens a lot.”\n“What, admirals sneaking off with former field operatives?” Jack asked.\n“No, people drastically changing their lives because they finally fall in love with someone,” Susan said wistfully.\n“Oh,” Jack said, noticing her tone. He was in the same boat … never really fell in love with anyone, but that was about to change, he thought.\n“Hey now, how did you know it was a field operative?” Susan asked.\n“Joy Simpson is the field agent who he ran off with, right?” he said.\n\u0026ldquo;And how do you know Ms. Simpson?” she asked.\n“Well, you’re going to meet them,” Jack said. “Love has really changed both of them, quite a bit, so get yourself ready.” He started walking up towards the house where Kyle was waiting outside the door.\n“They’re here?” Susan asked, suddenly suspicious. “On this island?”\n“Relax,” Jack said, stopping. “The raid has nothing to do with them, per se. I think it was triggered because of my transfer of assets to the Marine Mammals Institute, incorporated in San Francisco but with a major holding in Kiribati. There’s a Blackgate protocol nearby in the South Pacific, and so a computer program, not an investigation initially triggered the raid. Some cowboy wanting to make a name for himself probably made it official.”\n“Well, you’re right about the cowboy,” Susan said, thinking about the ass-chewing she helped deliver a few hours earlier. “But how did you know about the Blackgate?”\n“Mac knew about it,” Jack said. “His daughter set it. Didn’t you also investigate her? She retired suddenly.”\n“She was only a junior grade naval officer, wasn’t she?” Susan said, remembering the admiral’s file. “That’s not high enough for an automatic investigation and she probably didn’t have the same level of clearance as her father. How is she connected to all of this?”\n“You’ll understand when you see Mac and Joy,” he said.\n“You’re not about to show me something that puts me in an illegal or unethical position, are you?” she asked.\n“No, I’m not,” Jack said. “There’s nothing illegal or unethical about this whole thing. It’s just unbelievable. Come on, I trusted you.”\nSusan gave him her “look” and he held her gaze. Normally, that look wilted lesser men, but she decided to trust Jackson and besides, she was enormously curious to see the innermost sanctum of her notoriously private former employee. He turned and headed for the house, and she followed.\n“Are you sure this is the right wavelength?” Alexis asked, hunched over the radio with her Russian former colleague.\n“Da,” Galina answered.\n“You know, you get more Russian when you think about your homeland,” Petra said. “I’ve noticed that your accent gets thicker sometimes.”\n“That’s actually a common occurrence across many cultures,” Pat said. “Most people unconsciously adopt the vocal rhythms and inflections of the local language even if they can’t understand a single word. The same thing happens when we think of a place, especially if it’s where we grew up.”\n“Everything is a lesson,” Phoebe said, rolling her eyes.\n“Pipe down, you,” Pat said affectionately.\n\u0026ldquo;????????????. ??? ??????? ????, ??????? ??????? ???????????????\u0026rdquo; a voice crackled over the radio.\n“Hush now,” Galina said to her fellow mers.\nContinuing in Russian, Galina said, “Hello Science Base One, this is Grisha Permyakov, survivor of number six six seven ??????? (Dolphin class sub). I am here with Alexander Kolomnikov.”\nThere was a long silence.\n“Please identify the mission further,” the voice requested.\n“D-667-S was lost near 3 20’ 2\u0026rdquo; south by 170 20’ 12\u0026quot; west thirteen months ago,” Galina continued. “We are the only surviving crew. We were in an extravehicular craft on a scientific mission when a hull breach destroyed the 667. We were saved by locals without access to telecommunications, but have finally secured this radio. We need to speak with Chief Scientist Desisov, Director of the Primorsky Scientific Center, Vladivostok.”\nThere was a pause, and fifteen minutes passed. The mers grew anxious.\n“Comrades, you are alive!” a new voice answered, still in Russian. “We thought all hands had been lost on D-667-S. What is your status?”\n“Whom am I speaking with?” Galina asked.\n“This is Director Yelchukov!” the voice answered.\n“Anatoly!” Galina said with a squeal. “You got promoted!”\n“Is this Grisha? You don’t sound like Grisha Permyakov,” Anatoly said warily.\n“Anatoly, I know I sound different, but such a thing would a year on a small atoll do to a man,” Galina said. “But what has happened to Sergei Desisov?”\n“He became ill after your accident and died,” Anatoly said. “Cancer was the official diagnosis but heartbreak is mine.”\n“I am so sorry for the Center, he was a good man,” Galina said.\n“Is this really Grisha?” Anatoly said.\n“You are still the proud papa of your Laika’s, Pavel and Nikoli?” she asked.\n“Yes, Pavel still hunts with me,” Anatoly said. “Nikoli is too old now. He has retired.”\n“Getting his belly scratched and being fed too much by your lovely wife, Yaroslava, eh?” Galina laughed, thinking of Anatoly’s dogs.\n“You sound like you know me, but you do not sound like Grisha, my friend,” Anatoly said. “You sound like a girl.”\n“It is hard to believe, but I am still me, but you are right; I have changed,” Galina admitted. “The transformation is remarkable, and you will hardly believe it when you see me.”\n“Where are you? How will I see you?” Anatoly asked.\n“Can you get access to such a thing as Skype?” Galina asked.\n“Yes,” Anatoly answered. “You have access to the Internet on your atoll?”\n“Just recently,” Galina admitted. “Give me your Skype name and an American working with the Marine Mammals Institute, an international scientific organization where I now work, will contact you shortly. When you are in a more secure location, we can tell you more.”\n“You’re not going to get me in trouble, are you my strange sounding friend?” Anatoly asked.\n“No, no,” Galina said. “I’m going to make you famous, the most famous Russian scientist the world has known!”\n“I have much patience and skepticism, my friend. My username is anatoly.yelchukov,” he said.\n“How very much like a scientist,” Galina said. “So plain.”\n“Who will be calling me?” Anatoly asked.\n“His name is Kolbert,” she said. “He is the chief financial officer of the MMI.”\n“But this is a miracle! You’re alive,” Anatoly said. “Should I contact your family? What of Alexander?”\n“No, no,” Galina said. “There is still much to share with you, and we cannot yet share it with others. Please do not notify anyone. You will understand shortly. Can I have your promise?”\n“I can promise you silence for a few days, but I cannot keep this to myself for long,” Anatoly explained. “I would place myself in a difficult position.”\n“I understand,” Galina said. “A few days will have to do. More later, our conversation is unsecure.”\n“????????? ??? ? ?? ????????,” came the final reply.\n“Well, that’s done it,” Galina said, turning off the radio. “We have to get everything else going now.”\n“Right,” Pat said. “Phoebe, see if you can raise Jackson Baker on Skype.” Phoebe scurried over to the main computer at the front of the lab to begin that process.\n“Bart has the list of American and European scientists, and you think Anatoly can assemble the Russians?” Pat asked.\n“Yes,” Galina answered. “He is both smart and unafraid, a great scientist. He will understand our schematics very well.”\n“We’ve got them!” Phoebe said.\n“Alexis, can you go switch with Sally so she can talk to her father?” Pat asked.\nAlexis leapt from her spot several meters back from the pool and arced over Phoebe’s head into the water. Alexis shot down the tunnel like a bolt of lightning.\n“I can’t believe she’s pregnant,” Pat said, awed by her physical display.\n“Wait until Anatoly sees that,” Galina said with a smirk. “They used to play squash together.”\nThey both shambled in between tables and equipment until they reached Phoebe’s side. There on the computer screen was Jackson, looking fine.\n“Mr. Baker, good to see you,” Pat said.\n“Glad we don’t have to use the short wave?” he asked.\n“Glad to put faces to names,” Pat said. “Neither medium was secure, but there’s more chatter on the internet, and so I think we’re better off here.”\n“Train station security,” Jack said. “If you want a private conversation, go to a busy public space.”\n“Exactly,” Pat said. “What’s the status of everyone?”\n“Well, I’ve got a new laptop that I’ve taken down to my tank, so I’ll just show you,” he said, lifting up the computer and turning it around.\nPat watched as Mac, Joy, Annette and Bonnie waved to her from the top of the tank, and then they let go of the wall and slid into the water. Pat, Phoebe, and Galina all gasped when the four mers snapped out of view. A few seconds later, they reappeared at the top of the tank. Jack turned the computer back around.\n“What the hell was that?” Pat demanded.\n“It’s a long story,” Jack said. “But before I get started, I want to introduce you to a few others.”\nHe looked away from the camera and urged someone to come into the view. A male and female face both looked over his shoulder.\n“This here is Kyle Johnson, an old family friend of mine since childhood,” Jack said, and Kyle nodded. “And this is my former boss at the CIA, Susan Perilli. That is Pat McDonnell, the mermaid who started everything.”\n“CIA?” Pat squeaked.\n“Don’t worry,” Jack said smiling.\n“Yea, don’t worry,” Mac’s voice boomed from off camera. “She knows as much as we can tell her and she’s on board. Where’s my daughter?”\n“Coming,” said Phoebe. “She’s helping … never mind, she’ll be here shortly and she can tell you all about it.”\n“Mr. Baker?” Pat said. “Can you please let me know what’s going on there?”\n“First, it’s just Jack, and second, where do you want me to start?” he asked.\n“Start with carrying us both up the dock, unconscious, with Annette and Brent,” Mac said.\n“It’s Bonnie, thank you very much,” her voice said from off camera.\n“Wasn’t then,” Mac said. “Jack, are you going to get started or do we have to wait all day?”\n“Right,” Jack said. “So, they got here two weeks ago,” he began.\n“This is NOT fun,” Maja complained as she pressed down into the soft, brown material on the ground before her.\n“Those sensors are expensive,” Antonia explained. “Be careful, don’t press too hard.”\n“But it smells,” Maja whined. “Can’t you do this?”\n“I’m already doing my own,” Antonia said with a sigh. “This is the last time you’ll have to do it.”\n“I can’t believe that Harry and Val found theirs this morning,” Maja groused.\n“Ah, found it,” Antonia exclaimed, holding aloft her finger, a small purple capsule sticking to the tip.\nShe took a small plastic bag and put the capsule inside, sealing it with a flourish. She walked over to where Maja was bending over a small brown pile on the jungle floor. She peered over her shoulder.\n“It’s right there,” Antonia pointed.\n“Oh, yes, there it is,” Maja said, pressing her own finger on to the small pill and lifting it up. She put it into another plastic bag, and Antonia sealed it for her.\n“Let’s wash our hands and get to the pool,” Maja said. “Val and Harry have been there for twenty minutes already.”\n“Are you jealous?” Antonia asked.\n“No,” Maja said honestly. “Just horny.”\n“You’re insatiable,” Antonia agreed, giving her a peck on the cheek. “But adorable. I’ll put these in the beach bag while you wash up first.”\nThey hurried back to the huts and washed up. Then they both dashed up the path towards the rocky pool, laughing as they raced along. When they got to the pool they both stopped at the edge of the jungle and took in the view before them.\nValencia stood in the pool facing the morning sun, her long hair flowing over her shoulders and back. Her hands were on the edge of the rocky pool, and her legs spread wide, braced against the bottom of the pool. Harold stood behind her, his hands on her hips, his hips slapping into hers as he drove himself into her. Val’s breasts shook back and forth and Harold grunted with each thrust. Both Maja and Antonia watched as Val reached her climax, her legs collapsing under her.\n“That was sooooo good,” Val said as she turned around and leaned against the edge of the tub. “I can’t believe how you can just keep going and going and going,” she told him.\n“Neither can I,” Harold admitted. “But I’m glad you like it.”\n“I love it,” Valencia said, reaching out to stroke his still stiff penis.\n“I can’t believe that I came seven times last night,” Harold said, admiring Val’s jostling breasts as she stroked his cock with one hand.\n“Hey lovers,” Val called out, seeing her pod-mates at the edge of the jungle. “Come on in, the water is amazing.”\n“Everything come out O.K.?” Harold asked, over his shoulder.\n“Men are such little boys,” Maja said. “Girls do not speak of such things.”\n“Everything is fine and everybody’s ready to go,” Antonia said, smiling.\n“How soon do we have to be down to the beach?” Val asked.\nHarold looked up at the sun, “Not for at least another hour or so. Do you want to go down early?”\nValencia held up her hand, showing off her webbing. “I don’t want to start changing by accident.”\n“Don’t worry, there has to be at least one other person with mer organs to trigger the siren cells into Stage III,” Antonia said. “Didn’t you listen yesterday to Pat’s explanations?”\n“She got so technical,” Valencia said. “And besides, I was nervous about changing into a girl.”\n“Well, you can relax,” Antonia said, stepping into the pool. “You can’t change by accident. First you have to have a superabundance of siren cells, so you have to drink a lot of milk, and second, another person with mer organs needs to trigger the cascade.”\n“Yea, besides, I want at least one more time with Harry before we change,” Maja said, sliding next to her new mate, taking his still stiff cock from Valencia’s hand. “Do me from behind, just like you did Val,” she said, positioning herself in front of Val, pressing her breasts into her sister wife’s.\nHarold quickly positioned himself behind Maja and slipped his cock inside her. She cooed as it went in and leaned into Valencia, kissing her.\n“Do … you … think … we’ll … miss … it … like … this?” Maja asked as Harold thrust in and out from her petite body.\n“There are positions you can only do as a mermaid,” Antonia said. “I’m sure we’ll think of new positions to replace this one.”\n“Liz?” Trixi called out as she salamandered towards her hut. “Are you alright?”\n“I’m alive,” Liz’s voice came from within the hut.\n“Homa, Binah, and I are here for your next feeding,” Trixi continued. “Can we come in?”\n“No,” she said. “I’ll come out.”\nTrixi raised her eyebrows at her sister-wife as they both settled onto the sand. After a few seconds, Liz Wainwright emerged from her hut, walking carefully on her own two legs.\n“I’m walking,” she said, mostly to herself. “I’m finally, fucking walking!” she said, louder, celebrating.\n“So, is it worth it?” Trixi asked.\n“Last night?” Liz said. “Sorry I acted like such a baby, but I’ve never felt pain like that before. I know that Dawn explained how much healing her cancer had hurt, but I have to believe that regenerating spinal cords take the pain prize.”\n“Actually, it might,” Trixi said. “Pat wished we had thought of some sort of pain medicine for you. And don’t apologize; you were very brave, and everyone could see how much pain you were in.”\n“Yea,” Liz said. “You guys really called in the entire ambulance squad last night. Who saw me like that? I can hardly remember anything but the pain.”\n“James and his pod all tried to help,” Trixi said. “And all the scientists also had a look at you. It was quite a crowd.”\n“God, I’m going to have to crawl in a hole,” Liz said, shaking her long hair in front of her face.\n“No you won’t,” Homa said firmly. “You were brave, you were allowed to scream. It was terrible to hear, but it was the scream of victory.”\n“I am sorry for your pain,” Binah said, shifting on her fins. “Trixi explained to me that I did not hurt you.”\n“No, you were just the mermaid I was feeding from when the healing on my spine started,” Liz said. “I’m sorry I embarrassed you.”\n“You did not embarrass me,” Binah said, squaring her shoulders. “You frightened me. I was scared I had hurt you. It was my first time feeding.”\n“Well, we can put it all behind us now,” Trixi said. “Liz, don’t hide your face, honey, it’s alright and you’re looking beautiful.”\n“Well, thank you, Trixi,” Liz said, straightening up, pulling her more youthful hair back from her face. “The good news is that I feel tons better this morning. How do I look?”\n“You look amazing,” Trixi said. “I don’t think you’ll need to spend much time in the hot tub for further cooking. You’re nearly there already. In fact, you remind me of a movie star I saw once, but I can’t remember her name.”\n“Catherine Deneuve?” Liz asked, brushing her now blond hair back from her face.\n“Yes, that’s her!” Trixi said.\n“Yea, I got that a lot forty years ago,” she admitted. “I used to hate it, but if I had to resemble someone, she’s a classy actress. I could do worse.”\n“So, last feeding?” Trixi asked.\n“Sure,” Liz said. “And then you’re ferrying me over to Leonard?”\n“Right, along with your purple pill,” Trixi said, as Liz positioned herself under her breast.\n“I’ll bet you got Dian Parkinson when you were growing up,” Liz said, looking up at Trixi.\n“Actually, I never did,” Trixi said, smiling gently. “I was a boy growing up, remember?”\n“Oh, right! Sorry,” she said. “I just keep thinking most of you are like me, an old lady who now looks young.”\n“We concentrate on who we are now,” Trixi said. “Now, don’t worry, I’m not embarrassed. Drink up,” she said as she lowered her breast into Liz’s mouth.\nPeter stood at the edge of the rocky pool, looking out at the magnificent view. The late morning sun had burned off the dew from the jungle, but the air nearly two hundred meters above sea level was cooler and less humid than what Peter had encountered on his way up to the mountainside huts. Far beyond the gently curving arms of the lagoon below, a front was coming in from the east, a dark bank of clouds slowly approaching. They were about at least thirty miles out, and rain looked certain for the afternoon.\nPeter stretched, enjoying the vitality he now felt after several feedings from Alexis, Liga, and Sally. His body thrummed with energy, but he wanted to enjoy the next steps he hoped to take in his journey towards becoming a mermaid. He kicked off the sandals he wore to protect his feet, an old habit for which Eric had teased him. He didn’t like not wearing shoes, and even though most everyone else had adopted the habit of wearing as little as possible, and the mers needed no protective wear on their fins and flukes, he still wore his sandals.\nHe reached down and picked them up, knowing that this was the last time he would wear them. Once he changed, they would no longer fit, and it would be only the next day or so before he was a mermaid himself and would have no further need of them. He walked over to the edge of the jungle and placed them carefully along the path back to the huts, wondering if anyone else would wear them. He pulled a relay box from his pocket, slipped his swim trunks down his legs, and stepped out of them. He folded them carefully and laid them over the sandals. Naked, he turned back towards the tub.\nHe looked down at his body, which the siren cells had largely healed. He didn’t quite look twenty-five, but he no longer looked like an old man. His hair had darkened and lengthened, and his torso had toned and tightened. He was still a slender man, but soon he would change that. He smiled, confident in what he was about to do.\nThat morning, Sally had accidentally let slip that others were making bets on his chances of changing into a girl on his own. After Valencia’s failure, the odds had shifted against his success. Peter, however, did not share that pessimism, and he walked with confidence back to the pool. He took a deep breath, and concentrated on the air that filled his lungs. Pure air. In and out. Breathe in and out. He placed the relay box near one of the listening holes and prepared himself for the next step.\nHe pictured in his mind the woman he wanted to become. Cynthia Myers had occupied a special place in his heart for a long time. He closed his eyes as he remembered her enormous brown ones, with her thick brown hair, and those amazing breasts. He didn’t know if he could affect his own change, but he was going to try. If nothing else, he would end up looking like other women in his family. A picture of his mother crossed his imagination, and though his mother was never going to be confused with Ms. Myers, the two shared some features in common. Both were brunettes, and both were about five foot four inches tall, and both shared an hourglass figure, though his mother’s breasts were much more modest than the playmate’s.\nHe opened his eyes and looked down into the pool, trying to imagine the tiny, microscopic animals that now lived in the water. He raised his hands to his face and looked at his classic male hands a final time. He had graceful hands, long elegant fingers that many had mistook for a pianist’s hands, and his ring finger was nearly as long as his middle finger. He made a fist, and wondered what it would look like after he finished changing. He lowered his hand to his groin and pulled gently on his scrotum, peeling it away from his thighs. His penis was filling with blood in response to his sexual imaginings, but for the moment, he ignored it.\nHe took another deep breath and stepped into the warm water. He waded into the center of the pool and looked at the view another time. The water barely reached his crotch, and he wondered how much shorter he might get. If he succeeded, the water would cover his new hips and crotch easily. He lowered himself into the water, resting on his knees, and closed his eyes. He focused on the picture in his mind of the ravishing beauty that had been Miss December 1968. He felt his cock stiffen as he remembered her beauty, but he imagined the bubbles forming on his body, forming on his cock, and turning it inside out, thrusting his own flesh inside himself. He held himself in this position for several minutes, concentrating.\nHe opened his eyes to check for bubbles and saw that they were beginning to appear. His heart soared and taking a deep breath, he lowered himself into the water. He felt a slight tickling as the bubbles formed on his face, and he held his breath for as long as he could. The bubbles continued to flicker all over his body, slowly rising from all around him. His body was changing, but it was only becoming younger and his hair lengthened only a little bit more.\nHe rose to take a breath, and returned to the warm embrace of the water. The bubbles slackened off, just as they had for Valencia. Noooo! He would not be so easily discouraged. He rose back to the surface and breathed deeply, in and out, trying to relax. He held his face to the sky, thinking on how he could trick his body into releasing large amounts of prolactin. After a few minutes of breathing, trying to relax his body, he had an idea.\nHe twisted his arms behind his back and intertwined his hands together, palm to palm. He imagined that Cynthia Myers was behind him and was pulling on his arms, wrestling him towards submission. He closed his eyes, imagining her in a black, rubber swimsuit, looking a bit like a female, comic book superhero. She laughed in his ear, he imagined, and warned him not to struggle. It was too late; she was going to force him to become her! Peter struggled against his captor, feeling her pulling him to the bottom of the pool.\nHe fought with his imaginary opponent, struggling to reach the surface for air and then giving up, falling below, struggling against the black suited succubus seeking his male essence. Minutes passed as he continued the charade, keeping himself just below the surface except for desperate, gasps for air. Just as he was about to give up on giving up, he felt it. His struggle against his imaginary captor increased as the bubbles began to reform, tickling his skin in his crotch, armpits, and along the bottom of his feet.\nA brief stab of real fear shot through him, both because the tipping point had been reached and because he both desired and feared it at the same moment. Immediately pain shot through his body as the transformation cascade struck like a tsunami, bubbles exploding all around him. Desperately, he focused on his imaginary captor, seeing her body shake as she held him down against his own pain-induced flailing. The pain was just as quickly soothed by the spike in siren cells as they jumped from Type I’s to Type II’s, flooding his body with endorphins and a host of other hormones.\nHe moaned into the water as the siren cells and microorganisms did their work. His body twisted and turned, jerking with spasms as the transformation roared through his body. His head and face at first felt like jelly, shifting, pulling, pushing like silly putty, but soon his entire body felt as if it was being pressed and pulled in all directions. His lungs began to burn, and he really and truly struggled to rise for another breath. Adrenaline pumped through his body, and he found an accidental purchase on the bottom of the pool with one foot and weakly pushed up, his leg barely responding to his need. He breached like a whale, gasping for air as he fell back into the water, his body racked with a dull, low pain as his bones, muscles, and organs seemed to melt and rebuild.\nCynthia Myers laughed at him, looking down at him struggling under water.\n“Do you want this?” she asked, reaching to the top of her suit and exposing a zipper he hadn’t seen before. “Is this what you really want?”\nPeter nodded back, silently saying “yes, yes I want that. Give it to me.” The bubbles roared around him, and no part of his body felt stable. Every part of him was under assault. He couldn’t feel any individual changes because they were all happening at once.\nHe watched as the imaginary Ms. Myers slowly pulled on her zipper, exposing her deep cleavage, then down her thin waist, all the way to her wide hips, the hint of dark pubic hair visible.\n“Then you shall have it,” she said, pulling the sides of the suit away from her body, exposing herself to him. A jolt of pleasure ran through him, and her body started to solidify.\nShe felt both her body and her mind turn that corner, and it felt wonderful, satisfying. Ha! I did it, she thought to herself. After a few, agonizing long moments, the bubbles began to slacken, and soon they evaporated completely. It was over. The water was still, and the new girl floated about two feet below the surface. She could still see her captor standing over her, naked, but then she realized that she was looking at the pale, watery reflection of her own body.\nThe nerves in her body suddenly sprang back to life, feeling the water caressing her everywhere. Her long, thick brown hair floated like a halo around her face, and she let her hips drop and pushed herself up to the surface of the water. Her hair lay draped across her shoulders and over her breasts and back. Quickly, she dunked herself back under, lifted her chin, and took a step forward while rising, forcing her hair to run down her back.\nShe looked down at herself. It had worked! She wasn’t sure if she was an exact copy or not, but she was close enough that she wasn’t worried about it. She couldn’t see her face in the water very well, but she looked more like Cynthia Myers than she looked like her mother. Her breasts, which now jutted from her chest, were clearly closer to the playmate’s than her mother’s. She raised her hand to her face, looking at how her slender and delicate index finger was now longer than her ring finger.\nShe lowered that hand to her breast and ran it over the large, soft mound. Her nipples, at least from this new angle, didn’t look like the ones she remembered the playmate having. Hers seemed smaller, tighter, but they stuck out from the rounded surface of her areola more than she expected. She ran a finger across one of her nipples, feeling it bend, and let it snap back forward. A twinge ran through her body, and she felt a heat rising in her stomach.\nShe reached back along her head, feeling her breasts lift as she did, and smoothed her hair into a ponytail. She pulled it off her back and brought it over her shoulder, letting the wet strands slap against her breast and stomach. She flinched, feeling the same twinge run through her body. God, breasts are sensitive, or at least hers were, she thought. She looked down and saw that the ends of her hair reached her hipbone, and flipped it back over her shoulder. She shook her head, feeling her hair slither across her back, the ends of her hair brushing against her now rounded and full rear end.\nShe ran her hands down her body, tracing the slope inward at her waist, then back out at her hips. She ran her hands behind her back, feeling her new dimples above each ass cheek, and then the firm but soft flesh of her ass. She ran her hands back around her wide hips, across her jutting bones, and then down the V-shaped gully running towards her new sex. Her questing fingers found the soft tangle of pubic hair just below the waterline. Below that were her thick, pouting lips. Heat seemed to emanate from those lips, and she ran her fingernails down along each rounded bulge.\nShe gasped, hearing her own soprano voice for the first time. She smiled and walked over to the edge of the pool. She turned around, slid up onto the outward facing rock wall, and turned sideways to the pool. She struck a classic cheesecake pose, her arms behind her, propping herself up, her breasts thrust into the sky, her full rounded ass resting on the flat rock, her knees bent, and her legs crossed at the ankles. She turned a smokey glance back towards the jungle, challenging her imaginary captor to judge her now!\nOh, yes. She could feel the power within her new body. She knew that if Michael could see her now, he would be nearly helpless before her. Her new sex churned at the thought, throbbing between her legs. She turned to face her imagined lover as he hid in the jungle, watching her. She dropped her legs into the water and spread them, teasing her viewer, feeling her lower lips peel apart like a flower. She arched her back, and brought her hands up under her breasts, lifting them as an offering, feeling their weight in her hands. The heat in her abdomen increased, and she let one hand drop to her crotch as she slowly teased the top of her sex, finding\u0026ndash;and then avoiding\u0026ndash;her clitoris. Her nipples tightened further, her upper hand now pushing and pulling on each magnificent breast, while her lower hand pushed a finger into her new sex, making her gasp a second time.\n“Ooooohhhhhhh, sooooo gooood,” she sighed, moving her finger within herself.\nShe imagined Michael’s eyes upon her, and she quickened the circles she was making. A squishy, sucking sound rose as she began to push her body towards orgasm. Her breasts started to tingle, and she added the other hand to her crotch, her breasts now pressed together between her arms. One hand moved a finger in and out while the other pressed gently on her clit, rubbing the small, stiff button of flesh.\n“Ahhhhhh,” she cried out, her body convulsing.\nShe was close, and she pretended that Michael, Liz, and Len were all walking towards her, mesmerized by her sexuality. She convulsed again, closer still. Her breasts started leaking milk. She felt those eyes upon her, and she arched her back again, yielding up herself to her orgasm and their attention.\n“Oh, god, oh god, Oh God!” she cried as her first orgasm ran through her body, shaking her to her core.\nHer orgasm slowly subsided, her body twitching less and less, and her breathing slowed. She slipped back into the water, letting it caress her. She twisted her shoulders back and forth, loving how the water pulled at her breasts. She dunked her head under, and then walked up and out from the pool. She reached over, picked up the relay box, and headed down the path. She was supposed to meet Michael back down on the beach, and now she was really, really, looking forward to it.\nValencia dropped her chin to the top of Maja’s head as she cuddled her sister-wife in her arms, her legs wrapped around Maja’s waist. Her sister-wife was small enough that Valencia could completely enfold her. Harry, as the three girls had decided they should call him, sat next to her with Antonia similarly enfolded within his arms. Maja’s thick hair smelled like the ocean, which was unsurprising since they had just spent the better part of an hour playing together in the surf. The four of them sat together on the beach, waiting as the mers and other humans discussed the bombshell Valencia just dropped on them.\n“I think you are doing the right thing,” Antonia said, smiling from within Harold’s arms.\n“Thanks, Antonia. That means the world to me,” Valencia said.\n“Shush,” Maja said. “I’m trying to figure out what Pat is saying.”\nValencia looked over to where most of the mers had gathered on the beach, where Rani Basra had been arguing against any leniency for her father. She had a sudden inspiration, gave Maja a kiss on the crown of her head, and stood up. She walked over to Pat and waited for her to notice her.\n“Yes, Valencia?” Pat asked as the young woman loomed over her.\n“I know that my father has hurt and killed a great many people,” she began. “But I think that if we are going to try to discover whatever it is that mer justice will be, we must wait until we are all mers before we make such a decision.”\nEveryone was now looking at her.\n“I mean no disrespect for anyone’s pain,” she continued, feeling everyone’s eyes upon her. “But I respectfully suggest that we postpone any further discussion or decision about what to do with my father until everyone has transitioned into mers. It is because of my own transformation that I ask this, with the greatest humility and respect for everyone’s loss and pain.”\n“Some things can never be transformed,” Rani insisted. “We cannot transform Geeta back from the dead!”\n“I do not ask that you agree with my request not to kill my father,” Valencia said patiently. “I only ask that we gather again to discuss this after we have all become mers. I will abide by whatever decision we all make, but I know that I have changed, and that I am now free from my rash vow. If we decide to kill my father, it will because it is just and right to do so, not because the pain of what he has done feeds our anger and our thirst for vengeance.”\n“That was surprisingly well spoken,” Pat said. She looked at the Basras. “Will you agree to wait until after you transition?”\nThere was a long moment of silence as Rani, Vidya and Sudhish shared agonized looks and choked sobs. They leaned their heads together in a family huddle, and shared a quiet, but urgent, conversation. After a few more moments of terse exchanges and more sobs, Rani stood up.\n“Honor demands that such a polite request be respected. We will wait,” Rani said.\n“If we ever have politicians in mer society,” John said. “I’m going to keep my eye on you.”\n“I just want to try to do what is right,” Valencia said, not sure if she was being teased.\n“If only all politicians felt the same way,” John said.\n“Well, if we’re in agreement to wait, then we really ought to be getting these four back to the Moon Pool,” Pat said. “I’d like for us to not get caught out here in a storm, and besides, the sensor capsules I gave them an hour ago won’t last all day. Are you guys ready to go?”\n“Yes, we’re ready,” Harold said, rising and pulling up Antonia and Maja.\n“Great,” Pat said. “Mark, are you and your girls ready?”\n“Ready,” he answered, his girls already salamandering towards the surf.\n“Michael, are you and your pod still on schedule?” Pat asked.\n“Peter should be returning shortly, hopefully a different person, and Liz and Leonard are waiting for our signal to head up towards the mountainside huts,” Michael said, scanning the jungle. “Did you get any word from the mers in the lab?”\n“Phoebe?” Pat asked her sister-wife who sat in the shallow surf with the rest of her pod.\n“Just a second,” she said, turning to put her body under the water. They all watched as she swam out into the lagoon a few meters out, hovered for a second, and then turned back towards the beach. A second later she surfaced.\n“He did it, and you owe me a million dollars,” Phoebe said with a smile. “Let us know what name she’s chosen for herself.”\n“That’s great!” Michael said. “We actually talked about it earlier, and she is going to use Pearl.”\n“Good for Pearl!” Pat said. “I can’t wait to see the data on her transformation.”\n“You still owe me one million dollars,” Phoebe said, teasing.\n“Whatever. Everyone else remember what their assignments are?” Pat asked, looking around at the assembled throng. Everyone nodded and or voiced their assent.\n“Rose?” Pat asked.\nRose shuffled forward, handing each of them a beautiful headband, woven from the sea itself, and adorned with hearts along each of the temple lobes.\n“Why the hearts?” Pat asked.\n“Because this is the first pod formed by volunteers; they chose to be a pod,” Rose explained. “And Valencia has shown herself to possess a great and forgiving heart.”\n“Thank you,” Valencia said, her heart beating with emotion as she took the beautiful headband and slipped it across her forehead, tucking the ends under her hair, behind her ears. “I will try to live up to this gift.”\n“You will,” Rose said. “You’re going to be very special, I can tell.”\nThere was a moment of silence, and then Pat said, “Let’s go,” turning to where John, Danni, and Phoebe waited with the children.\nValencia watched in gratitude and shock as the great and colorful gathering of mers all turned and headed for the beach. Mark’s pod hung back, waiting for them in the shallow water. Harold turned to her and arched an eyebrow, and Valencia felt the connection they had been building for the past sixteen hours vibrate with energy. She smiled back at him and nodded. Both Antonia and Maja nodded too, and the four of them joined hands and walked into the surf.\nTrixi caught Valencia’s eye, signaling that she should come to her. Valencia looked at the beautiful mermaid, one who had been a male like her at one time, now having beautiful blond tresses flowing down her body, her incredible breasts wobbling behind the veil of hair, her blue and yellow striped tail curled beneath her as readied herself to ferry Valencia to the Moon Pool. She walked towards the blond goddess, and eased onto her back as the mermaid extended her body horizontally towards the open ocean.\nAs Trixi started to swim, Valencia felt the rush of the cool seawater over her body, so unlike the hot tub or when she and her pod-mates had been playing in the shallow surf. The water got colder as they moved out into the open ocean, but Valencia knew it would only be cold for a short while. She saw Antonia riding along the back of Binah ahead to her left, and Maja riding Homa on her right. At the front of the diamond formation used by all pods, her darling Harry rode just off to one side of Mark’s center, making room for Mark’s dorsal fin that sliced through the water as he swam.\nHarold looked like he was body surfing, holding onto Mark’s shoulder with only one hand, moving his body back and forth, as they were towed by the mers. Antonia, Maja, and herself all held onto their mermaids with two hands and generally just enjoyed the feelings of closeness and warmth emanating from the mermaids beneath them. Harold looked back at his girls, grinning like a little boy playing with a toy as he sluiced back and forth in Mark’s wake.\nThey moved along the southern edge of the island, heading for the sheer cliffs dominating the western face of the island. Below those cliffs, lay the entrance to the mer caves. Valencia looked up at the cliffs as they loomed over her, wondering what great cataclysmic force thrust up this island when it first burst forth from the sea. The mers slowed down as they approached the center of the cliffs, and then they stopped.\n“If anyone needs to have fresh air, just tap us on the shoulder and we can give you a quick breath,” Mark explained. “Your baby gills may be enough, but don’t be embarrassed if you get light-headed or dizzy. Ask for air, don’t make us give it to you. Got it?”\nEveryone nodded, took a few deep breaths just in case, and the mers all pulled their passengers under the surface of the water.\nValencia tried to see what was happening under water, but not only was it difficult to keep her eyes open at the speeds the mers were moving but also the cloudy sky made the water seem darker than normal. She kept her focus on just the four of them, and watched as Mark and Harold entered the softly glowing entrance to the large tunnel that would take them inside.\nThe water seemed warmer inside the tunnel, and maybe it was just the system of softly glowing seaweed that gave the tunnel a warmer feeling, but Valencia thought it looked like a fairy land. They passed by a maze of exits from the tunnel, and Valencia was glad she had was merely a passenger. It must take mer senses to keep from getting lost in here, she thought. She felt a moment of panic as the air in her lungs seemed to grow stale, but the feeling passed as the fronds along her back grew stiff in the water and started to function for the first time. Soon they entered the Moon Pool.\nMark and his pod swam for the surface and eased their passengers towards the large shelf that ran along one side of the cave.\n“There’s food along the wall,” he said. “Eat your fill while we coordinate with the girls in the lab to get everything ready. We’ll be back in a few minutes.”\nThey all turned and flipped over as they swam back under the water. Harold hoisted himself out of the water, then turned and helped each one of his girls out of the water, easily lifting them up onto the shelf. They walked over to the pile of fish, dried fruits, and sea grasses laid out along the wall and began to eat, knowing they were about to gain a significant amount of body mass.\n“What colors do you want your tails to be?” Maja asked. “I want bright red tail with blue highlights.”\n“Why red?” Antonia asked.\n“I had an aunt who told me when I was a very young girl that red was my color,” Maja explained. “Red is also the color of passion … and … well …”\n“Say no more,” Antonia laughed. “Red is your color! Well, if that’s your color, then blue is mine. I’d like a blue tail with red highlights so that everyone knows we’re sister-wives.”\n“I would like a red and blue tail, equal parts, with white highlights,” Valencia said.\n“What about you, Harry?” Maja asked. “What kind of tail do you want.”\n“A strong one,” he said. “So I can keep up with all of you.”\n“We’re ready for you,” Mark said, his head popping up out of the pool along with the rest of his pod. “Now, remember, you’re all going to go at the same time. Harold, you start with Bill’s girls, alright? Valencia you start with MuSu’s girls, Antonia with Tuo’s pod, and Maja with Wong’s girls. Everybody got it?”\nThey all nodded.\n“Hey, why isn’t Pat worried about all the mermen being present?” Trixi asked. “Remember how they had to get out for you?”\n“I thought the same thing when she gave us our assignment this morning,” Mark admitted. “But she explained that these guys are already bonded, and so our presence won’t affect Harold at all.”\n“I was just worried that I’d have to feed from my sister,” Harold said.\n“Yea, we wouldn’t make you do that, experiment or not,” Trixi said.\n“Right, so how do you all want to turn out?” Mark asked.\nHarold explained the color schemes they had chosen, explaining that he would like a dark blue one, and Mark and his girls disappeared beneath the surface to relay the info to the rest of the mers below them.\n“I’m so glad that my father isn’t here,” Valencia said. “I don’t want him or his energy to be part of this moment.”\n“We should kill a chicken and splash it’s blood on the doorstep,” Maja said. “Gotta keep out the bad spirits when you say his name.”\n“How about I kiss you instead, and fill this room with love,” Valencia said, walking over to her tiny, Filipina sister-wife. “After seeing what these mers can do, I’m done with the silly superstitions of my grandmother.”\n“Yes, I have an idea on how. Let’s really fill this room with love,” Antonia agreed. She moved Maja to the edge of the pool facing away from the water, and then guided Valencia to a spot near her, while she took the middle spot and together they faced Harold.\n“Harry, do you forswear all others and take we three to be your podmates and sister-wives for as long as we all shall live?” Antonia asked solemnly.\nHe looked at the three, beautiful, naked woman before him. There was a flash of lightening and then a roll of thunder. The storm was upon the island. He glanced up and saw the rain coming in through the chimney hole above. He turned back to the girls.\n“I forswear all others and through sunshine and rain, through sunsets and storms, I shall remain true to you at the peril of my life,” he said.\nValencia felt her heart swell as he answered. She took Antonia’s hand in her own and squeezed it, knowing that she was doing the same to Maja. The three of them looked expectantly at Harold. After a moment he said, “Oh, right. Yes. Do you, Valencia, Antonia, and Maja forswear all others and take me to be your pod-mate and husband for as long as we all shall live?”\n“We do,” answered the three girls in unison.\nValencia and Maja reached out with their outside hands and invited Harold into a group hug and kiss. As they were sharing the group kiss, Antonia leaned backwards and pulled them all into the pool. They splashed into the water giggling and kissing, staying together as they slowly let air out to sink into the pool. When they had leveled off at about five meters below the surface, they found themselves surrounded by most of the mers. The only ones missing were John’s, Gabriel’s, and Eric’s pods, the ones with the mermaid scientists.\nValencia marveled at the colors and beauty surrounding them. The thirty-six mers were grouped by pod, and she swam over to Emma with her beautiful blue and white tail. She thought that her tail might look a bit like that, except hers would be blue and red, a union of Antonia’s and Maja’s tails, a sign of their shared sisterhood.\n“As one who\u0026ndash;like me\u0026ndash;started as a boy, will you help me complete my final transformation?” Valencia asked Emma.\n“Yes,” Emma answered, the energy of the transformation ceremony starting to swirl in her own belly and breasts. “Drink from me and receive your tail.”\nValencia drank from Emma’s breasts, draining each one in turn. When she was done, she turned to Rikki, and asked for her tail again. As she suckled at Rikki’s breasts, Valencia could hear her pod-mates ask for their tails as well. She drained Rikki and then moved to Cleo, her body now vibrating with the energy of the siren cells as they careened towards the tipping point for Type III. She only made it through one of Cleo’s breasts when she felt her legs stiffen and her arms pulled from her sides.\nMuSu moved her rigid body into the center of the pool, and Valencia watched each of her pod mates positioned similarly. She became aware of a rich, harmonic hum that filled the water, and she felt herself beginning to spin. Suddenly, the pool erupted with bubbles, beginning her final transformation.\nThe following few minutes were a blur of euphoria, pain, joy, fear, and ecstasy feeling her body pulled, stretched, and morphed into the magnificently powerful and beautiful body of a mermaid. She was suddenly aware of her red and blue flukes, vibrating above her head, and her glorious mass of hair, now reaching below her hips, floating all around her.\nHer mer organs started to function, and she felt the bright prickling of energy that connected her to her pod-mates strengthen and grow. She barely noticed the frenzy of activity surrounding her as the transformational estrus overwhelmed the pods. She only had eyes for her pod. Antonia was even more lush and beautiful than she had been, and even Maja’s curves had grown. Valencia felt the heat from the gazes her mates were giving her, and she looked down to see that her curves had grown as well.\nBy unspoken agreement, Antonia took the lead and positioned herself in front of Harold, Maja and Valencia on either side. All three girls gasped when they saw Harold’s mer penis emerge for the first time, telescoping out from his dark, blue tail. Antonia thrust her light blue hips against his, taking him in with a single thrust, while Maja and Valencia experienced the magic of pelvic fins for the first time. Valencia clutched Harold’s arm, hunching her hips into his fin as it pushed her deliriously towards her first mer orgasm. Her breasts were spraying milk into the pool, and she felt her sister-wives begin to orgasm too.\nLater, when Valencia discovered what it felt like to have Harold’s enormous cock buried within her, she was gratified to discover that Harold retained his ability to go on and on without stopping.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/changes-in-paradise16/","tags":["mermaids","transgender","transformation"],"title":"Changes in Paradise: Part 16 - Science, Sons, and Sirens"},{"categories":["Mermaids"],"contents":"Mers and soon-to-be-mers in both oceans wonder if their struggle for peace will be successful. The last of the rescued survivors begin their journeys as the Chesapeake mers make new discoveries and add new members. Will Malaki finally face justice? The saga continues!\nSudhish Basra glanced back over his shoulder, checking the progress of the approaching storm front from the east. He sighed. His long walk away from the lagoon, a chance for him to sort out all the feelings that erupted after his second feeding, was going to be interrupted by the storm. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell how far away it was\u0026ndash;the gray-green ocean being a useless reference point\u0026ndash;but he guessed it would be here before he could make it back to the lagoon. Maybe he should just cut back across through the jungle? No, he didn\u0026rsquo;t really know the island very well and the beach wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to get him lost.\nThe sound of distant thunder echoed, confirming the storm\u0026rsquo;s size.\nWell, if lightning struck him while he was walking back, it would solve some of his problems, he thought. He stopped, looking at the clear sky above his head. Who or what was up there? Why in Krishna\u0026rsquo;s name had all this happened to him and his family! Why?\nNothing. Just silence. Well, not really silence; there were the birds in the jungle, the wind in the palms, and the waves rolling onto the sand.\nAnd another peal of thunder.\nHe shook his fists at the heavens.\nHe loved his sisters, of course he did! But why, oh gods, why did he now feel so guilty about it? This morning, after their second feeding, he started to fantasize about having sex with his sister, Rani. He was appalled! Thankfully, his own shame and his shorts had prevented anyone from noticing his arousal before he regained control. Gods! Rani was beautiful! So was Vidya, but it was Rani\u0026rsquo;s large, soft breasts that caught him by surprise this morning.\nOvernight the first feeding of mermaid milk had worked its magic, or that\u0026rsquo;s what it looked like to Sudhish. Rani and Vidya were bursting with health, and since they were already in their early twenties, little else had changed. Well, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely true; both had become more shapely, especially up top, and both had decided to remain topless, since none of the mermaids wore anything. The sight of his sisters, topless, healthy, happy, and laughing should have brought him joy, but instead, it was agony.\nThe queasy feeling rolled through him, and he wondered if he would throw up. He sank to the sand, breathing deeply, trying to make the feeling go away. His own sisters! He watched them this morning as they kissed each other in a most unsisterly way! He had been entranced and repulsed. What was happening to him, to his sisters? This was taboo!\nHe crossed his legs and sat more purposefully on the sand, breathing deeply, forcing himself to meditate.\nHis revulsion retreated, and his stomach settled. He opened his eyes, watching the surf and the approaching clouds. Yes, yes, he knew these changes were going to happen. He had seen how the other pods acted, and there were several sets of sisters who were already pod-mates. None of them seemed troubled by their new arrangements. In fact, nearly all the mers engaged in outrageous public displays of affection. Why couldn\u0026rsquo;t he rid himself of his guilt and shame?\nOne more feeding, and then he and his sisters would head for the mountainside pool. One more feeding \u0026hellip; would that be enough to make his feelings of disgust and self-loathing go away? One more feeding.\nHe shook his head, rose, and began walking back towards the lagoon. After a few minutes, it began to rain.\n\u0026ldquo;How much longer, do you think?\u0026rdquo; Leonard asked, peering out at the rain lashing against the mountainside huts.\n\u0026ldquo;Hard to say,\u0026rdquo; Liz answered, leaning her long, supple, and naked body out of the door, gazing towards the east where the sky seemed to suggest an easing of the dark gray clouds overhead. \u0026ldquo;It should be safe to go up to the tub as soon as this dark patch passes. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to be struck by lightning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, especially when all this \u0026hellip; stuff \u0026hellip; is about to happen,\u0026rdquo; he agreed.\nAgain, Len admired Liz\u0026rsquo;s extraordinary backside. He\u0026rsquo;d followed it up from the beach for a good part of the afternoon, and he hadn\u0026rsquo;t tired of the view. Liz\u0026rsquo;s aristocratic breeding was evident in every part of her body. She was graceful, lean, and beautiful, a woman who might look equally at home riding a horse as slinking across a dance floor in an evening gown. Her shoulders were broad but lithe, her waist was high and small, and her hips were generous to a fault. From behind, she reminded Len of Jaclyn Smith from that television show, Charlie\u0026rsquo;s Angels. From the front, Liz was almost a dead ringer for Catherine Deneuve. From any angle, she was a beautiful woman.\nLiz took a deep breath, smelling the rain, the earth, and the air. Not only could she walk again, but her senses had been reawakened. She could see, smell, and hear everything with heartbreaking clarity. She hugged herself as she stood in the doorway, feeling the her body\u0026rsquo;s new energy and something else that had long been absent: her libido. She welcomed her reawakened passion, enjoying the thrill her body now gave her. She reached out an arm and caught some rain water in her cupped hand. She brought it back and splashed it over her breasts, gasping at the sensation.\nShe turned back around, feeling Len\u0026rsquo;s hungry stare. Her nipples had crinkled up and were poking from her chest. She saw Len\u0026rsquo;s eyes orient on her breasts and she subtly rolled her shoulders, watching his eyes move back and forth. A warmth ignited in her groin, rising quickly through her trim body, bringing color to her cheeks.\nShe moved her eyes over her future pod-mate, and admired his now trim and youthful physique. He noticed her noticing and blushed a bit.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s weird, isn\u0026rsquo;t it, being young again?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s lovely to feel young, alive, and able to walk,\u0026rdquo; Liz said. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s weird is that shortly, we\u0026rsquo;ll both be mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I guess when you put it that way,\u0026rdquo; Len said.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve dreamed of mermaids since you were a kid,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, her tone softening. \u0026ldquo;For me, becoming a mermaid was the price of my emancipation from my wheelchair.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t want to be a mermaid?\u0026rdquo; Len asked, taken aback.\n\u0026ldquo;I do now,\u0026rdquo; Liz said. \u0026ldquo;But I didn\u0026rsquo;t start out that way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing,\u0026rdquo; Len admitted. \u0026ldquo;But \u0026hellip; well \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; just \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nLiz walked over to Len, familiar now with his quirks and fears. She laid a hand on his shoulder.\n\u0026ldquo;Relax, Len,\u0026rdquo; she said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not going anywhere. In fact, in the last hour or so, I\u0026rsquo;ve rather enjoyed feeling horny being near you. We\u0026rsquo;re going to be fine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It just feels like \u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t want \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he kept trying.\nLiz took his hand and brought it up to her chest. She clasped her other hand over his and pressed his hand to her sternum. Len stared at his hand, held by hers, resting between her breasts. Liz was classically proportioned, her breasts were two beautiful champagne glasses, modest B cups, topped with strawberry nipples now stiff with excitement.\n\u0026ldquo;Len, I\u0026rsquo;ve grown quite fond of you, and I know that we\u0026rsquo;re about to be joined in a bond closer than most people ever even dream of sharing,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;I want to do this, and I want you to be happy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I guess I\u0026rsquo;m just frustrated not knowing what\u0026rsquo;s going on,\u0026rdquo; Len said.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you a little bit, how\u0026rsquo;s that?\u0026rdquo; she said, playfully moving the back of Len\u0026rsquo;s hand across her breasts. \u0026ldquo;As soon as these storm clouds pass, you and I will go up to the hot tub, and there, I am going to seduce you into having the best sex of your life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Len said, startled. He looked again at the classic beauty before him. They were going to make love? This experiment was a far better experience than he expected! \u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; she said, leaning forward and kissing him, her cool blue eyes fixed on his. \u0026ldquo;There, you feel better now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Len breathed, barely keeping his feet. Her kiss was so soft, so sensuous, making his entire body thrum. His cock stiffened.\n\u0026ldquo;Look, the rain has slackened,\u0026rdquo; she said, looking out the doorway to the hut. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go,\u0026rdquo; she said, pulling on his hand.\n\u0026ldquo;Grab that relay box,\u0026rdquo; she said as they passed through the open door.\nLen reached down and grabbed the small, black box as he walked out the door. Liz turned and walked forward, keeping Len\u0026rsquo;s hand grasped in her own.\nA light rain still fell, soaking them within a few steps. The rain pitter-pattered throughout the jungle as they walked, their rhythm slowing as they made their way along the narrow trail. Len\u0026rsquo;s attention remained fixed on Liz\u0026rsquo;s beautiful ass, watching it roll back and forth as she walked. He was entranced by the gap between her upper thighs, occasionally glimpsing a wisp of blond hair at the apex, a gap and an apex he too would soon possess. Finally, they reached the hot tub, the rain slackening as the sky began to lighten.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll take that,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, reaching for the black box.\nShe walked over to the cliff wall extending up from the ledge, carefully placing the box near one of the listening holes. She walked back to where Len stood, more or less shocked and excited all at the same time.\n\u0026ldquo;Into the pool,\u0026rdquo; she urged, stepping down herself.\nLen looked around, suddenly feeling as though someone was watching. He was about to check the path when Liz called to him.\n\u0026ldquo;Len, come here,\u0026rdquo; she urged, holding her slim and youthful arms towards him, a smile on her face, her breasts reaching out towards him.\nHe couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist her and walked into the pool. She gathered him into an embrace, kissing his neck, face, and lips. She moved slowly, keeping her body pressed against his, his throbbing erection wedged between them. She ran her hands along his back, teasing his nascent gills. He shivered.\n\u0026ldquo;That felt amazing,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Do mine,\u0026rdquo; she urged.\nLen raised his hands from her hips tracing his fingers lightly up her back until he brushed against her tender gill fronds. She sighed appreciatively, still kissing him slowly, gently. She leaned away from him, reaching down to grab his penis, and then pulling him as she waded back towards the far wall, the same one on which Peter/Pearl had perched, imagining her imaginary lover earlier in the day.\nLiz scooted up onto the wall, still holding Len\u0026rsquo;s stiff cock. She spread her legs and guided his cock towards her sex.\n\u0026ldquo;Watch me,\u0026rdquo; she urged. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t look anywhere else, no matter what. You got that?\u0026rdquo;\nLen nodded, unable to speak, watching this ravishing beauty, a sight right out of a movie fantasy, as she rubbed his cock head over her sex, teasing both of them to greater heights of anticipation and passion.\n\u0026ldquo;Feels good, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Wonder what it will feel like once you\u0026rsquo;re a girl?\u0026rdquo;\nLen nodded again, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Push it in, slowly,\u0026rdquo; she said, positioning his cock just inside her folds.\nShe moved her hand from his cock to his hip, guiding him. Len pushed in slowly, feeling the rippling tight heat of her vagina as it opened slowly. She felt hotter and tighter than anyone else he could remember.\n\u0026ldquo;Slowly,\u0026rdquo; she said, pressing her hand against his hip.\nLen backed off, just the tip of his cock resting inside her. When she nodded, he pushed again, realizing that Liz probably hadn\u0026rsquo;t had a man inside her since her accident. His cock inched its way into her, bit by agonizingly wonderful bit. Finally, he was entirely within her. She wrapped her legs around his waist and pulled him into a kiss. He leaned forward, resting his hands on the rock wall, pressing his body lengthwise into hers. She moved her hips in little circles, loosening up her tight hold on his cock.\nShe thrust her tongue into his mouth, her passion rising. Len felt his own passion rising too, and was surprised, because he wasn\u0026rsquo;t moving. Liz was so tight and so warm, that her little hip movements were more than enough to stimulate him towards an orgasm. He wanted to slow down, to enjoy this moment, and so he put one hand on her hip to slow her down.\nHis touch electrified her, and she moaned into their kisses. She held his face with both hands, kissing him and moving her body beneath him. Len felt the stirrings of an orgasm build, and seemed powerless to stop Liz from propelling both of them towards an orgasm too quickly.\nHe heard someone enter the water, but Liz held him in the kiss, and he remembered her admonition to hold her gaze. Her hips began to buck, and he started moving his hips back and forth. Together, they began to fuck in earnest. As Liz continued to move beneath him, a warm soft body slid up against him and two enormous breasts rubbed against his arm.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s me, Pearl,\u0026rdquo; the soft, seductive voice said in his ear, and Len realized Peter must have transitioned on his own. He was about to turn towards her when he felt her hand press against his cheek. \u0026ldquo;No peeking,\u0026rdquo; Pearl said, kissing Len softly on his shoulder.\nLiz reached up and pulled his face to hers, kissing him, silently urging him faster. Len could feel her lips moving and realized that she was saying \u0026ldquo;fuck me, fuck me, fuck me\u0026rdquo; under her breath. Len complied, thrusting into her in a frenzy. Len sensed someone next to Liz, and Pearl turned towards the new person. From the corner of his eye, he could see Pearl sucking on an enormous cock. It had to be Michael\u0026rsquo;s, and realizing that, it both thrilled and frightened him.\nLiz started moaning, and she came to her orgasm, her breasts starting to leak milk as her eyes rolled back in her head. She still held his face as she thrashed out a quick orgasm.\n\u0026ldquo;Keep fucking me,\u0026rdquo; she urged, as she recovered.\nLen stared into her eyes, nose to nose, slamming his hips into her, feeling his own orgasm miraculously continuing to build, not quite releasing, owing to the excruciating tightness at the base of his cock. He could hear Michael breathing as Pearl worked his cock, but Liz\u0026rsquo;s fierce grip on his face prevented him from turning.\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me,\u0026rdquo; she urged, a second orgasm rising up and taking her. \u0026ldquo;Oh, god \u0026hellip; god, that\u0026rsquo;s good,\u0026rdquo; she gasped.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; my \u0026hellip; Liz \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Len grunted, getting closer and closer.\nLiz watched his eyes as he pounded into her, and then just as Len felt the last peak in his orgasm build, she looked to her left.\nThe first jet of Len\u0026rsquo;s orgasm ripped through his penis, and he nearly lost his footing. He felt the second pulse gather and heard a deep baritone voice call to him.\n\u0026ldquo;Lucy, look at me,\u0026rdquo; Michael ordered.\nAs Liz ground her hips into him, a second pulse raced out from Len\u0026rsquo;s cock as he felt Michael\u0026rsquo;s cock brush his cheek. He looked up and discovered Pearl holding Michael\u0026rsquo;s now very impressive cock, pointing it at his mouth.\nTime seemed to stop; nothing moved.\nLen\u0026rsquo;s entire world narrowed down into the infinity of this nanosecond, a brief space of time in between his own orgasmic squirts into Liz. Michael\u0026rsquo;s penis hung before him, enormous, red, and alien. Len had never been this close to another man\u0026rsquo;s penis in his life. He\u0026rsquo;d never thought of doing what Michael wanted him to do. As another pleasurable pulse gathered deep within his own cock, Len\u0026rsquo;s stomach clenched in fear and disgust. At that very same instant, he realized that Michael\u0026rsquo;s cock offered the fulfillment of one of his greatest fantasies, to join these beautiful creatures, as a mermaid! All he had to do was lean forward, and \u0026hellip;.\n\u0026ldquo;Go ahead, Lucy,\u0026rdquo; Pearl encouraged as she slowly stroked Michael\u0026rsquo;s cock. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s delicious.\u0026rdquo;\nHis heart pounded even faster in anticipation, a third pulse rose from his balls, and he leaned forward and took Michael\u0026rsquo;s massive cock into his mouth, \u0026lsquo;This is it!\u0026rsquo; he thought.\nMichael\u0026rsquo;s first pulse matched Len\u0026rsquo;s last.\nThe warm, salty fluid gushed in his mouth, and as the last, achingly beautiful pulse passed through his cock, Len felt a tingle rise along his spine and land at the base of his skull. A second pulse gushed from Michael\u0026rsquo;s cock, and Lucy swallowed, feeling the warm liquid ease down her throat. She felt her cock quickly soften, slipping from Liz\u0026rsquo;s warm vagina as a third pulse filled her mouth. A final pulse filled her mouth again, and she reflexively swallowed again.\n\u0026ldquo;Lie back,\u0026rdquo; Michael urged, as both he and Pearl cradled her head in their hands. Michael stepped down from the rock wall where he had been standing.\nLucy let herself be guided back until she lay horizontal in the pool, her head cradled by Michael, who was now looking years younger. She felt Pearl and Liz come to her hips and support her legs and lower torso, as the energies unleashed by her spike in prolactin began their work.\nBubbles erupted around her, her body feeling like mush. She wanted to remind Michael of her desire to become Kelly Brook, but speech was beyond her. She felt Michael crouching down into the pool next to her, his face near hers.\n\u0026ldquo;Hold your breath,\u0026rdquo; he urged, lifting her up slightly.\nShe gasped in a breath, and Michael eased them both under the surface. She could see Michael\u0026rsquo;s face through the veil of bubbles watching them finish his change to the younger version of himself. A searing pain tore through her torso and shattered her moment of tranquility, marking the start of her transformation. She doubled up into a fetal position, riding out the storm as her body was twisted, stretched, pushed, compressed, and reshaped. She felt the siren cells finally kick in and ease the sharp pain, reducing it to a dull, aching, throbbing pressure. She rode that wave of aching pressure as her body hurtled towards femininity.\nA series of sharp bursts of pain signaled the forming of her new hips, her smaller frame, new facial structure, and her slender limbs. The pressure in her abdomen and chest signaled the emergence of new or newly awakened organs, and her hair began tugging at her scalp as she rolled in the water. After a several more minutes of discomfort, the bubbles abated and slowly came to a stop.\nLucy floated on the surface of the water, her breath easing in and out of her nose with a corresponding rise and fall of her chest. She could feel something there. She also felt the echoes of her last male orgasm still reverberating in a new emptiness she felt throbbing between her legs. As quickly as she focused on those echoes, the emptiness absorbed those vestiges of male lethargy, transforming them into a female readiness for more. That novel feeling spread outward from her hips in slow, persistent waves, bringing awareness of the width of her new hips, the new weights on her chest, the lightness of her new limbs, and finally the tug of her long hair on her head.\nThe hands supporting her helped her stand up, and she found herself in the pool, the water lapping at her hips. Her breasts were the first things she noticed. They both looked and felt enormous. Michael must have made a mistake, she thought. She looked up at Michael and saw his gaze locked onto her breasts. The look in his eyes made her feel good, actually, and she decided that perhaps he didn\u0026rsquo;t make a mistake.\nShe looked over Pearl for the first time, and realized two things at once. First, that her new sister-wife\u0026rsquo;s breasts were the equal, or even larger, than her own, and second, that Pearl was as entranced with her own new breasts as was Michael. Lucy felt even better after those realizations.\n\u0026ldquo;So, it\u0026rsquo;s Lucy, is it?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked, still recovering from her orgasms. \u0026ldquo;From the book?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Michael answered, not taking his eyes from Lucy\u0026rsquo;s breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;How do you feel?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked, catching Lucy\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;How do I look?\u0026rdquo; she asked, her trepidation rising as she heard her new feminine voice for the first time.\n\u0026ldquo;Like a goddess,\u0026rdquo; Pearl answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Like a goddess,\u0026rdquo; Liz agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Like Kelly Brook,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, lifting his eyes to her face.\n\u0026ldquo;Like Lucy, the Mermaid Scribe,\u0026rdquo; Lucy said, smiling for the first time.\n\u0026ldquo;If one more self-important, pompous representative of a head-of-state calls this office, I\u0026rsquo;m going to \u0026hellip; going to \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Lucia muttered to herself.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going to what?\u0026rdquo; her boss asked from the other room.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m gonna have to kick some stuck-up-no-account-godforsaken-ass!\u0026rdquo; she said, entering with an armful of papers.\n\u0026ldquo;I completely understand that sentiment,\u0026rdquo; Bart said, rubbing his eyes and pushing himself away from his computer.\n\u0026ldquo;Why you always gotta talk so good,\u0026rdquo; she challenged. \u0026ldquo;Why can\u0026rsquo;t you just say, I\u0026rsquo;m down with that. Something simple. Damn.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll be worse than me after law school,\u0026rdquo; he teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha, not likely,\u0026rdquo; she said, setting the papers on the growing pile on his desk. \u0026ldquo;A bunch of people from the old law firm have been calling you, like all day. How long do I halfta keep lying to them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Until I say otherwise, sorry,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;Besides, the next few days will either make all this go away, or it\u0026rsquo;s going to be ten times worse than before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I vote for go away,\u0026rdquo; Lucia said, throwing herself into the seat across from him.\n\u0026ldquo;Me too,\u0026rdquo; Bart agreed. \u0026ldquo;But our votes only count for so much, and we\u0026rsquo;re all wading into unknown waters here. I\u0026rsquo;ve never tried to negotiate such a conference or summit or meeting.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not a conference or a summit or anything else,\u0026rdquo; Lucia said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s gonna be a shitstorm; we already discussed this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I very much appreciate your candid honesty, but I could do with a little bit more irrational optimism, at the moment,\u0026rdquo; Bart said, turning back to his computer. \u0026ldquo;Do we have everyone\u0026rsquo;s time zones worked out?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I loaded everyone\u0026rsquo;s locations into Google Maps, and then sent them invitations based on everyone\u0026rsquo;s variation from UTC,\u0026rdquo; Lucia said. \u0026ldquo;So, everyone should have the right time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What time will that be \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Bart said.\n\u0026ldquo;For us,\u0026rdquo; Lucia interrupted. \u0026ldquo;Nine o\u0026rsquo;clock at night.\u0026rdquo;\nBart scanned the spreadsheet on his computer again, double checking everything.\n\u0026ldquo;Can I ask you something?\u0026rdquo; Lucia asked.\n\u0026ldquo;When have I ever said that you couldn\u0026rsquo;t?\u0026rdquo; Bart asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I know, I can always ask, but you can\u0026rsquo;t always answer,\u0026rdquo; Lucia. \u0026ldquo;What did you send to all those scientists this morning that changed everyone\u0026rsquo;s tune? I mean, it was like we turned on a switch, and now everyone is calling us back and acting all worried about us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you really want to know?\u0026rdquo; Bart asked, turning towards her. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll never be the same after I give you the answer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I want to know,\u0026rdquo; Lucia said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve spent most of my life not knowing enough, and so, I\u0026rsquo;m done with that. I want to know more, and I want to know why we spent two days begging people to take us seriously and then one day telling everybody to back off.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve heard the phrase \u0026lsquo;Doomsday Device\u0026rsquo; haven\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo; Bart asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Like science fiction, right?\u0026rdquo; Lucia said. \u0026ldquo;Some sort of bomb that will make the world end, like a super big nuclear bomb.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Close enough,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;The mers have discovered something that will pretty much do the same thing, only it\u0026rsquo;s made out of bacteria, basically.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Germs?\u0026rdquo; Lucia said. \u0026ldquo;Germs are gonna wipe out the whole planet?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, not really,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;But \u0026hellip; now that I think about it, they sort of did already, probably a few times.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; Lucia asked. \u0026ldquo;How?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, there was the plague in the middle ages, which decimated human life in Europe and Asia, and nearly wiped out human life in the Americas,\u0026rdquo; Bart said.\n\u0026ldquo;You mean, like Native Americans?\u0026rdquo; Lucia asked. \u0026ldquo;Nearly wiped out?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The Vikings had been trying to colonize the Americas for nearly 900 years and never succeeded,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;The Vikings \u0026hellip; the badasses of Europe, and the native peoples on this continent kicked their butts back to Norway.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but the Pilgrims didn\u0026rsquo;t get kicked out,\u0026rdquo; Lucia said.\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;If the plague hadn\u0026rsquo;t wiped out nearly eighty percent of the native population, none of the early colonies would have lasted.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, the mers have some sort of germ that will kill off humans?\u0026rdquo; Lucia asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;They have created a bug that disaggregates seawater.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Dis-a-who?\u0026rdquo; Lucia asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Breaks down seawater into oxygen and hydrogen,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;Adding a huge amount of those two gases to the atmosphere would cause all organic life, plants, animals, \u0026hellip; us \u0026hellip; to burn up at room temperature.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Whoa,\u0026rdquo; Lucia said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s heavy shit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No shit,\u0026rdquo; Bart said.\n\u0026ldquo;No wonder everyone changed their tune,\u0026rdquo; Lucia said. \u0026ldquo;Are we in trouble?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; Bart asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Could this dis-agra-something actually happen?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;Hopefully, what we\u0026rsquo;re doing now will prevent that from ever happening.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m down with that,\u0026rdquo; Lucia said, rising. \u0026ldquo;Not burning up is at the top of my to-do list.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The summit is in three days, and so there had better be some other things at the top of that list,\u0026rdquo; Bart said, trying to keep some humor alive.\n\u0026ldquo;No problemo, boss,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m all over it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got to check on that seaplane,\u0026rdquo; Bart muttered. \u0026ldquo;Thirty years of experience, and I\u0026rsquo;m a shipping clerk.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re the lawyer! I\u0026rsquo;m the shipping clerk,\u0026rdquo; Lucia said, whipping out her cell phone. \u0026ldquo;Besides, it\u0026rsquo;s a miracle you can use the computer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right, I\u0026rsquo;ll go back to soothing egos and confirming schedules,\u0026rdquo; Bart said.\n\u0026ldquo;Can I have the manifest? It\u0026rsquo;s on the third pile from the left on your credenza,\u0026rdquo; she asked, holding out her hand.\nHe turned, found it, gave it to her, and turned back to his desk.\n\u0026ldquo;Bottom left desk drawer,\u0026rdquo; she said, turning to leave the office.\nBart reached down, opened the drawer, and saw the half bottle of whiskey in the drawer.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey,\u0026rdquo; Bart said, stopping her.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Lucia asked, turning in the doorway.\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks,\u0026rdquo; he said, reaching for both the bottle and the phone.\n\u0026ldquo;No problemo,\u0026rdquo; she said, winking and turning out of the office.\n\u0026ldquo;I really can\u0026rsquo;t wear this,\u0026rdquo; Mac complained, removing the Service Dress Blue jacket and proffering it up to Jack. \u0026ldquo;When you finally get your gills, you\u0026rsquo;ll understand. Besides, I don\u0026rsquo;t look like a retired admiral any more. I\u0026rsquo;ll show them my Navy ID card, from when I first enlisted, and that should do the trick.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Susan thinks it will make a difference,\u0026rdquo; Jack argued. \u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t you just wear it for a few minutes, at the start of the polycom session?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Two minutes, max,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;Seriously, having something other than your own hair over your gill fronds really messes up a mer. Jackson, relax. Getting all worked up will actually work against us. We have to project an air of competency or we\u0026rsquo;re doomed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I know, you\u0026rsquo;ve sat in the room yourself,\u0026rdquo; Jack agreed. \u0026ldquo;I just wish Bart had given us more time. If we start now, I\u0026rsquo;ll be in the middle of transition when the big conference call happens. Now I\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait three more days before I can get my pod going.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, I think that would be a mistake,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I think you and Kyle should assemble your volunteers and get started. There needs to be more people with siren cells in their bodies, otherwise the four of us are exclusive\u0026ndash;and relatively easy\u0026ndash;targets.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Susan wants to start a pod too,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;That would make four pods of the Camo-mers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I liked her. How is she going to handle that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s ready to retire and has some trusted friends who share her twisted sense of adventure, are also single, and want a second chance at life,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\n\u0026ldquo;Twisted?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s never been further than two hours from Washington, DC in her entire life,\u0026rdquo; Jack explained. \u0026ldquo;But she\u0026rsquo;s been dreaming of escaping to a south sea island since she was a little girl. Never thought about the mermaid angle, but she\u0026rsquo;s dreamed about living in paradise.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But she\u0026rsquo;s o.k. with the mermaid angle?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, seems weird, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\n\u0026ldquo;Not to me,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said, stretching out along the floor.\n\u0026ldquo;So, what are you waiting for? Go get Kyle and get your pods assembled and get back here as soon as possible,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;I hate being the only good target in a room.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;First put in a call to Bart and get him to up the number of headbands from Pat,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;We might as well have a few extras while we\u0026rsquo;re at it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What should I tell him?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s make it 24, and see what that does for us,\u0026rdquo; Joy said.\n\u0026ldquo;Another day, another data point,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, dusting off the detector mirror on their new spectrometer.\n\u0026ldquo;A clean mad scientist is a happy mad scientist,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, glancing around the busy lab cave, watching all the activity.\nJames and his pod were here because they now had all sorts of medical equipment to be used for wellness, rather than for experimentation or exploration, and they were arranging a new \u0026ldquo;medical area\u0026rdquo; of the lab cave that would be dedicated towards advancing what the mers knew about their diet, exercise, and injuries, even though mermaid milk took care of most of those. They were just finishing up their new corner.\n\u0026ldquo;How long did Rose say it would take her pod to get those headbands done?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Now that everyone in that pod can make them, it should only take an hour or so,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe answered. \u0026ldquo;They had to swim to the north side of the island to find a good upwelling current.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We have got to figure out a way to get others to learn how to make these headbands, or Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pod will be forced to do these by the hundreds,\u0026rdquo; Pat muttered.\n\u0026ldquo;Rose is working on it, she\u0026rsquo;s been working with Eric and Sally, and Eric seems really close. He said the ones he makes almost work,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Da, that is where they are now,\u0026rdquo; Alexis confirmed.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, good,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;We really should bring Eric back in now that we have all this new equipment. We might learn something about how he sees our CHEW connections.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He does not like your instruments,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said with a smile.\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re your instruments too,\u0026rdquo; Pat teased.\n\u0026ldquo;My instruments are right here,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, lifting her hair to reveal a breast. \u0026ldquo;He likes these instruments.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Galina, when did Bart say that airplane would arrive?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, switching subjects.\nGalina opened up the email account and checked Bart\u0026rsquo;s email. \u0026ldquo;He does not say exactly, but it is this afternoon. I would say not for at least three more hours, at least.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, if that\u0026rsquo;s the case, let\u0026rsquo;s send a message up top to Michael and his girls that as soon as they see the plane leave, they need to switch places with Emma and the Basras,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;They can hang out on the beach for a one or two days while Emma finishes up her stage two transition in case we need humans on the island.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are we going to do after the everyone transition to mers?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked. \u0026ldquo;We won\u0026rsquo;t have anyone human left on the island, and then next delivery or shipment will have to be made to mers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll have to talk to Bart about that, see what he thinks we ought to do,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;So, what good news do you have for us today?\u0026rdquo; Elise asked, salamandering up to Pat. \u0026ldquo;How much have those little purple pills been able to tell us?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, quite a bit,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;We have a much better understanding of the early stages of mer development and the mechanisms for bonding.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Give us the highlights,\u0026rdquo; James said, joining his pod-mate at Pat\u0026rsquo;s table. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t read most of what\u0026rsquo;s written there,\u0026rdquo; he said, waving his hands at the several computer screens in front of Pat\u0026rsquo;s station.\nPat glanced over the notes and reports arranged over several screens. Nearly everything they did in the lab was recorded as a mixture of math, English, and Russian, a common habit that the four scientists had fallen into without ever talking about it. She smiled, it was almost like a security feature.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we\u0026rsquo;ve discovered that the three mer organs along our spines are created by Type II siren cells, so both bonding and mer senses are available to proto-mers who have completed Stage II transformations,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;These organs become bigger and more powerful after Stage III transformations. We\u0026rsquo;ve also discovered that mermaid milk is also the key to most of the behaviors and benefits we\u0026rsquo;ve experienced as mers. It\u0026rsquo;s actually extraordinary.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It changed us into mers, of course it\u0026rsquo;s extraordinary,\u0026rdquo; James agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I mean it affects all kinds of biological and psychological systems in our bodies,\u0026rdquo; she continued. \u0026ldquo;For example, most female mammals who are lactating have elevated glucocorticoid levels, which tends to decrease testosterone in surrounding males. That lowered testosterone encourages males to be less aggressive with each other and more helpful to the females who are with a child.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But that\u0026rsquo;s not the case with us, right?\u0026rdquo; James asked. \u0026ldquo;Mermaids lactate regardless of their gravidity.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Gravidity?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Archaic, the state of being pregnant or not,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s always a lesson, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Not my fault,\u0026rdquo; Pat protested. \u0026ldquo;He said it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You were explaining,\u0026rdquo; James said with a smile at Phoebe.\n\u0026ldquo;Right, sorry,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;In the case of mers, females have high glucocorticoid levels but males do not have a corresponding lower level of testosterone. In fact, mermen have very high levels of testosterone compared to normal human men.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, the lactating females encourage strong bonds within each pod, and the high testosterone is why we can never have two or more males in the presence of a single mermaid,\u0026rdquo; James surmised.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we think that males would actually be even more aggressive if they were un-bonded,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;But we\u0026rsquo;ve never had an unbonded male,\u0026rdquo; James said.\n\u0026ldquo;Correct, and since all our children are born female, that\u0026rsquo;s likely to be a very rare occurrence,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued. \u0026ldquo;However, merman aggression is tamed by the very high sex drives among both female and male mers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, it\u0026rsquo;s just for a safer world that we have sex all the time,\u0026rdquo; John joked. \u0026ldquo;Hey, I\u0026rsquo;ll say anything to get laid.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have to say anything to get laid,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, grinning. \u0026ldquo;You get laid no matter what!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sex is almost as powerful as mermaid milk, and so it\u0026rsquo;s not surprising that the two are linked,\u0026rdquo; Pat continued. \u0026ldquo;Our bonding is reinforced each time we orgasm, which also helps keep male aggression in check, which also stimulates more lactation in females, which also strengthens bonding, which also helps keep aggression in check, which also stimulates our libidos, etc., etc., etc.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m afraid that all this talk has \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; James started, but he was yanked into the pool by Debra and Bridget, with Elise fast on their flukes. They tumbled into the water and were quickly entwined in the center of the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;I think that\u0026rsquo;s a really good idea,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said with a predatory look at John.\n\u0026ldquo;Now, just a minute,\u0026rdquo; John began.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s going on up here? Is someone transforming? All the kids went into sleep mode,\u0026rdquo; said Danni her head popping up from the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;Now,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said with a growl, curling her tail beneath her, readying herself for a spring at John.\n\u0026ldquo;Yikes,\u0026rdquo; John said, launching himself towards Danni. \u0026ldquo;Protect me!\u0026rdquo;\nHe tumbled gracelessly into the water, splashing water everywhere. Phoebe launched herself after him, gracefully arching in the air, slicing into the water near Danni and John.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry ladies, but it\u0026rsquo;s better to make love than war,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, salamandering towards the pool.\nAlexis and Galania looked at each other, realizing their pod-mates were all at the lagoon.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s better than nothing,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, raising an eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s better than most things,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, waving her arm down her body.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Alexis said, and she shuffled over and embraced her fellow scientist in a fluke curling kiss.\nMalaki seethed in his captivity. He was bound and gagged through most of the day and night, force fed food and water twice a day, and once a day he was dragged through the surf to clean off the grime and his own waste. No prisoner in the world had to put up with such degradation! He fumed in silence in his hut.\nOf course, if someone had been there to argue with him, they might have pointed to the countless prisoners, prostitutes, and kidnapped victims who had been treated as badly or worse by his own men over the years. Malaki would not have enjoyed the irony, of course, and probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even recognize it as irony.\nHis situation was hopeless, but he had experience with hopelessness. Sure, he was stuck on an island everyone in his organization thought was uninhabited, if they even knew the island existed. Sure, his sole, surviving son was an idiot, a brute of a man who was more dangerous than he was useful. He knew death was preferable to most of his other options, for the moment, but he was too stubborn to simply roll over and die. No, he would not make it easy for these monsters.\nHe resumed the isometric exercises, trying to build strength back into his limbs. The mers had stopped giving him venom in the water, and his strength and energy had returned. If he had an opportunity, he was going to make these monsters pay. For the moment, he cared little for survival, or so he told himself. He existed solely to cause these creatures pain and suffering.\nLucy walked towards the mountainside huts, noticing the clouds slowly clearing as the sun grew brighter. The colors and textures in the jungle seemed more vivid and alive now than on her walk up to the tub only a short time ago. The greens were more varied and more lush, the browns were deeper and richer, it was almost like she could smell color.\nNot only was her surroundings more alive, her own body seemed more alive. It certainly moved more. Her hips rolled with every step she took, and her breasts never seemed to stop moving. She glanced backwards to check in on Pearl and was grateful, for a moment, that her own breasts weren\u0026rsquo;t as big as her pod-mate\u0026rsquo;s. Pearl\u0026rsquo;s breasts jumped and wobbled like two fighting roosters tied to the same stake. Lucy looked at Liz\u0026rsquo;s round ass ahead of her, and noted how her own small waist and wide hips were closer to Liz\u0026rsquo;s than Pearl\u0026rsquo;s. Yes, Lucy thought to herself, I may not be exactly like Kelly Brook, but I\u0026rsquo;m not unlike Pearl and Liz; I\u0026rsquo;m a mix of all three models.\nAhead, she could see Michael\u0026rsquo;s back, and she imagined his now flaccid cock bobbing along in front of him. Fear and desire stabbed in her gut, and she wondered if her fear would ever go away. She suspected that they were going to have sex, all four of them, in the huts, but she had been kept in the dark for so long that she was prepared for anything to happen.\nShe watched as Michael entered the main hut, but Pearl called out from behind and told him to wait a few minutes. She waved the other two girls towards one of the smaller huts.\n\u0026ldquo;I know it\u0026rsquo;s sort of cliche, but I wanted to do something with you girls,\u0026rdquo; she explained as she entered Patrick\u0026rsquo;s old bedroom hut. She walked over to the small bed and loosened the strings to one of the collection bags the mers normally used to collect food. Once the opening was wide enough, Pearl upended the bag onto the bed. A variety of women\u0026rsquo;s clothing tumbled out in all shapes, sizes, and colors.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been dreaming of being a girl my whole life,\u0026rdquo; she explained. \u0026ldquo;And I just wanted to wear one pretty thing before I became a mermaid, and then couldn\u0026rsquo;t wear much of anything. You can laugh at me if you want.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nonsense,\u0026rdquo; Liz exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s perfectly understandable. The first thing I wanted to do was walk, and so the first thing you wanted to do was be a lady.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, Liz,\u0026rdquo; Pearl said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been worrying about this moment, thinking that you girls would think I was silly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course we don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Liz said. \u0026ldquo;Right Lucy?\u0026rdquo;\nLucy looked up, caught staring at what looked like a red nightie. She blushed. \u0026ldquo;Um, no, of course not,\u0026rdquo; she stammered. \u0026ldquo;I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s not like we will ever have the chance again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Pearl said, her eyes gleaming with excitement. \u0026ldquo;I only wish we had a mirror so I could do makeup.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure there is a mirror in the other hut, but make up is out of the question,\u0026rdquo; Liz said. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think there is any on the island. We\u0026rsquo;ll have to make do with what we have here. What do you want to try on first?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This!\u0026rdquo; Pearl said as she reached for a simple sundress. She held it up, showing it to Liz.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think it will fit me?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Only one way to find out,\u0026rdquo; Liz said. \u0026ldquo;Put it on. Now, how about you, Lucy. Did you ever cross dress?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; she said, staring at the collection of female clothing before her.\n\u0026ldquo;Is there something wrong?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Lucy said, feeling her blush rise to her face.\n\u0026ldquo;Which one do you want to try on?\u0026rdquo; Liz repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Lucy said, suddenly feeling like she was the boy in a girl\u0026rsquo;s locker room.\n\u0026ldquo;Just pick something!\u0026rdquo; Pearl said, dancing with her dress as though it was a partner. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to wear a dress, and it\u0026rsquo;s going to fit!\u0026rdquo; she said, stopping and lifting the dress over her head.\nLucy watched Pearl shimmy into the yellow, tube style, sundress. Pearl had to keep pulling and tugging to get the dress over her breasts, and then she bent over at the waist, pulled the front of the dress towards the floor, let her breasts dangle freely, snugged the front back over her breasts, and stood back up, flipping her long brown hair behind her.\n\u0026ldquo;You look like you\u0026rsquo;ve done that before,\u0026rdquo; Liz remarked.\n\u0026ldquo;Water balloons,\u0026rdquo; Pearl said, adjusting her breasts inside the dress. \u0026ldquo;The real thing is so much better. Well, how do I look?\u0026rdquo;\nLucy\u0026rsquo;s vagina twitched as she looked at the sexy woman before her. Pearl\u0026rsquo;s hair framed her face, with one strand curling over her shoulder, resting on the impressive shelf of her breast. The fabric was stretched tight over her body, conforming to the dramatic shape of Pearl\u0026rsquo;s torso from the tops of her breasts to the middle of her hips, and then the bright fabric fell freely to just below her knees. Pearl twirled in the dress, making it flare out.\n\u0026ldquo;Look! I don\u0026rsquo;t need straps to hold this dress up,\u0026rdquo; Pearl said, pointing at top hem of the dress stretched tight over her deep cleavage.\n\u0026ldquo;I can hardly believe you got it on,\u0026rdquo; Liz said.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, what\u0026rsquo;s going on in there?\u0026rdquo; Michael asked from the other hut.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re dressing for dinner,\u0026rdquo; Pearl shouted. \u0026ldquo;Find something to wear, some shorts or something. We\u0026rsquo;re all wearing something!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So that\u0026rsquo;s what you were talking to Petra about earlier,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;Fine, I\u0026rsquo;ll throw on some shorts. Don\u0026rsquo;t be too long, I\u0026rsquo;m hungry!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We are too,\u0026rdquo; Pearl shouted back. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you dare start without us!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Lucy?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I just don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Lucy said, feeling like her next decision would be a wrong one.\n\u0026ldquo;Lucy, you\u0026rsquo;re a beautiful woman, you\u0026rsquo;re allowed to wear these things,\u0026rdquo; Liz reassured her. \u0026ldquo;How about this one,\u0026rdquo; she indicated the red, lace confection that Lucy had been staring at.\n\u0026ldquo;Would that nightie even fit?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s actually called a baby doll, and so it should fit nearly anyone, though both you and Pearl are pretty big on top,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, lifting the red garment towards Lucy.\n\u0026ldquo;It is beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Lucy said, fingering the shimmering lace between her fingers. \u0026ldquo;But \u0026hellip; um, how do I \u0026hellip; I mean, where does this \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Lucy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Here, let me help you,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, lifting it up. \u0026ldquo;Hold your arms up, that\u0026rsquo;s right. My, that makes your breasts look absolutely spectacular. Hold still, no\u0026ndash;keep your arms up, yes I know that feels good, but wait until we get you settled. I\u0026rsquo;m going to settle your breast into the cup, alright? Good. How does that feel?\u0026rdquo; she asked, her own nipples stiffening as she moved Lucy\u0026rsquo;s incredible breasts around.\n\u0026ldquo;Pretty good, I guess,\u0026rdquo; Lucy said, wishing Liz hadn\u0026rsquo;t stopped touching her breast. She twirled like Pearl, enjoying the slight compression of the material across her new and impressive bust as the bottom fluttered around her thighs. \u0026ldquo;What are you going to wear?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, eyeing the pile of clothes. She picked up a simple, white, silk robe. \u0026ldquo;This will do. I\u0026rsquo;ve worn lots of women\u0026rsquo;s clothes in my time. Besides, I don\u0026rsquo;t think any of us are going to be wearing any of this much longer. If Michael doesn\u0026rsquo;t rip that dress off, I may have to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you dare! I\u0026rsquo;m wearing it for all of dinner,\u0026rdquo; Pearl said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m starving. Let\u0026rsquo;s eat.\u0026rdquo;\nThe three women walked out of the small hut and back to the larger one. They found Michael arranging the food he and Pearl had brought up earlier on the large bed that John had constructed after Patrick had become Patricia.\nHe looked up and froze. The three beautiful women had unconsciously posed as they entered the room, and they took his breath away.\n\u0026ldquo;How do we look?\u0026rdquo; Pearl asked, turning in profile a bit more, arching her back.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, wow \u0026hellip; wow,\u0026rdquo; he said, his shorts quickly tenting in front.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll take that as really, really, good,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, moving to sit on one edge of the bed, artfully allowing one side of her robe to open, exposing her breasts and belly. \u0026ldquo;Pearl, you come sit by me. I\u0026rsquo;ve already had my way with Lucy, and you\u0026rsquo;ve already had your\u0026rsquo;s with Michael, right?\u0026rdquo;\nThere was no answer, and Liz turned and saw that Pearl was looking into a mirror.\n\u0026ldquo;Pearl?\u0026rdquo; Liz repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;It was part of the experiment,\u0026rdquo; Pearl said absently, stroking her face as she admired herself for the first time. \u0026ldquo;Each of us in turn.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I love these experiments,\u0026rdquo; Michael said with a laugh.\n\u0026ldquo;It worked!\u0026rdquo; Pearl said rapturously. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a woman!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You needed a reflection to tell you that?\u0026rdquo; Liz teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, no,\u0026rdquo; Pearl agreed, hefting her breasts in her hands. \u0026ldquo;But I ended up looking a lot like Cynthia Myers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s who you remind me of!\u0026rdquo; Lucy said. \u0026ldquo;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of her name! She was the first playmate born in the 1950s.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, my girls span the decades,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\n\u0026ldquo;Pearl, can I?\u0026rdquo; Lucy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; she said, stepping aside to allow her sister-wife access to the mirror. She joined Liz on the bed as Lucy stepped up to the mirror.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my,\u0026rdquo; Lucy gasped.\nShe ran her fingers along her lips, down her chin, and along her neck. She was almost a dead ringer for Kelly Brook, but there was something off. What was it? She was certainly beautiful. Her hair framed her face just like the original, her eyes were large and expressive, her lips full and sensuous, and her features elf-like.\n\u0026ldquo;How about you, Lucy, ready for another stage of the experiment?\u0026rdquo; Michael asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Humm?\u0026rdquo; she said, lost in the beauty of her own reflection.\n\u0026ldquo;Is everything alright?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked, sensing Lucy\u0026rsquo;s confusion with her proto-mer senses and the early bond she shared with her.\n\u0026ldquo;Something\u0026rsquo;s not right?\u0026rdquo; Lucy said, studying her reflection. \u0026ldquo;Blue eyes!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong with blue eyes?\u0026rdquo; Michael asked. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m partial to blue eyes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Kelly Brook has brown eyes, and mine are blue,\u0026rdquo; Lucy explained.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\n\u0026ldquo;No, no!\u0026rdquo; Lucy exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;I like blue eyes too, and I\u0026rsquo;m actually really happy that I\u0026rsquo;m not simply a copy of her. I\u0026rsquo;m Lucy; I\u0026rsquo;m me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re glad you\u0026rsquo;re you too,\u0026rdquo; Michael agreed. \u0026ldquo;Now, we have an experiment to finish, don\u0026rsquo;t we?\u0026rdquo;\nLucy looked at Michael and saw his bulge stretching the front of his shorts. She felt the same mix of desire and fear, but she was determined to overcome her fears. The best defense is a good offense, she decided, and walked over to Liz, leaning over until her breasts reached across Liz\u0026rsquo;s shoulder and brushed against her sister-wife\u0026rsquo;s face. Lucy watched Michael\u0026rsquo;s eyes as they watched her lace clad nipple brush back and forth along Liz\u0026rsquo;s cheek.\n\u0026ldquo;Before we continue, is there anything else I\u0026rsquo;m not supposed to know about?\u0026rdquo; Lucy asked, doing her best to look innocent and helpless.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re the lawyer,\u0026rdquo; Michael teased. \u0026ldquo;What does the evidence suggest?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Am I still a lawyer?\u0026rdquo; she asked. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I feel like one anymore.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t look like one either,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;But you will always have that bright and sharp mind, that incredible memory, and your wicked sense of humor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not freaked out?\u0026rdquo; Lucy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you?\u0026rdquo; Michael asked.\n\u0026ldquo;A little,\u0026rdquo; Lucy admitted.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not,\u0026rdquo; he said with warmth and patience. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re beautiful, you\u0026rsquo;re still smart and funny, and there are no more surprises, or at least none that I know about. Pat wanted readings of a change when prolactin levels were likely at their lowest possible ebb. We created that situation.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that is for sure,\u0026rdquo; Lucy said, running a hand along Liz\u0026rsquo;s neck, down her collarbone and into the valley of her cleavage. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think I ever felt so male in my life. I had no idea you were so passionate,\u0026rdquo; Lucy said as she bent over, simultaneously kissing Liz\u0026rsquo;s neck and caressing her breasts. Liz\u0026rsquo;s breasts felt wonderful in her hand, and her skin beneath her lips was soft and sensuous.\n\u0026ldquo;You can only kiss me if you\u0026rsquo;re feeding me,\u0026rdquo; Liz sighed, teasing Michael by twisting to show Lucy\u0026rsquo;s hand on her breast. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m hungry,\u0026rdquo; she said with a pointed look at Pearl.\n\u0026ldquo;Then try some of this,\u0026rdquo; Pearl said, placing some fruit along the top of her dress over her cleavage. \u0026ldquo;See how you like it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Off you go, to Michael, don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid,\u0026rdquo; Liz urged Lucy, giving her a gentle push on her hips. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got to eat some of that,\u0026rdquo; she said, scooting over to Pearl and positioning herself before her incredible breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;Here, let\u0026rsquo;s start with this,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, holding a piece of fruit in his fingers.\nLucy walked over to him, clasping her hands behind her back, pushing her lace-clad breasts towards him. She watched him watch her breasts as she walked to him and then took the fruit from his fingers with her lips. She kissed his fingers after she chewed on the tangy fruit. The touch of his fingers on her lips sent sent spasms of pleasure through her body. Her fears began to ebb, slowly overwhelmed by her growing confidence and desire.\n\u0026ldquo;More please,\u0026rdquo; she said, looking up at him through her lashes, feeling like her breasts were growing, swelling with her passion as she stood there.\nMichael fed Lucy several bits and pieces of fruit, fish, and greens, his fingers lingering along her lips, chin, and nose. The heat between her legs grew, and she became more aggressive, snapping up the food from his fingers, licking and sucking each digit to get all the juices from the fruit and the morsels of dried fish.\nWhen she was done, Michael sat down on the bed and held out a hand with food in it.\n\u0026ldquo;Feed me,\u0026rdquo; he said.\nLucy reached down, took a piece of fish, and straddled one of his legs, feeling the heat from her crotch radiate downward. She fed him once piece of food at a time, rocking her hips slightly, feeling her body move as she fed him. When she had exhausted what was in Michael\u0026rsquo;s hand, she reached forward, brushing one of her lace clad breasts into his shoulder, grabbed some more food, and then stood back up. The burning look of desire in his eyes made her shudder with anticipation.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve got to eat this food, or we\u0026rsquo;ll die,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, nuzzling the top of Pearl\u0026rsquo;s breasts. \u0026ldquo;So, do not take your dress off yet, or I\u0026rsquo;ll never make it back to the food,\u0026rdquo; she said as she gave one last lick and turned back to the pile of food.\n\u0026ldquo;Here, you eat some more, too,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, reaching blindly behind his back, gathering a few morsels of food, and then bringing them forward to the goddess standing before him.\nAs Lucy extended her hand to his mouth, she leaned forward causing his rising hand to brush against her breast. Her nipple was poking out under the lace, a thimble sized rise of flesh, and his fingers flicked it back and forth as his hand rose past it. She moaned as he inserted the food into her mouth but was overwhelmed by the feeling that she had wet herself. As she slowly chewed the fruit in her mouth, she realized that she hadn\u0026rsquo;t accidentally peed. She was a woman who was powerfully aroused.\nShe fed Michael another piece of fish and found herself looking at his face in a way she had never done before. She remembered examining many female faces and being mesmerized by the graceful curve of a neck, the soft down of hair behind an ear, the wide pools of a pair of beautiful eyes. Now she was looking at the tiny cleft in his chin, the deep recesses of his piercing blue eyes, the rich, unruly forest of his hair. He looked a little bit like a young, Robert Redford, she thought. For the first time in her life, she thought that Robert Redford was HOT.\n\u0026ldquo;Michael \u0026hellip; you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026hellip; you\u0026rsquo;re beautiful!\u0026rdquo; Lucy whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you, my goddess,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;Though I think the preferred term is handsome, when speaking of the male sex.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s new to the girl thing, give her time,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, helping Pearl peel her dress down from her now visible breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;Lucy, you are simply and amazingly beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, reaching up and pulling her in for a kiss.\nAs they kissed, Lucy slowly sank down until she straddled his thigh. Her naked vagina was pressed into his leg, and a spasm of pleasure jerked her body as she felt another\u0026rsquo;s touch in her most private of places for the first time. It was the first time anything had pressed against her vagina, not even her own hand. She sighed into his kiss, putting her full weight onto his thigh.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; oh \u0026hellip; god,\u0026rdquo; she whispered, her body buffeted by a whirlwind of sensations she had never felt before.\nIt felt like her crotch was on fire; a wet, liquid, unquenchable fire. She ground herself down on his thigh, her lower lips making slippery squishing sounds as she rocked back and forth. Michael wrapped his arms around her tiny waist and thrust his tongue into her mouth.\nMichael fell back onto the bed, still kissing, pulling Lucy with him. She felt the bed sink as Liz and Pearl lay along side them, the heat from their bodies stoking the flames of passion rising in her own body. She pressed her body against Michael\u0026rsquo;s as they kissed, his hard cock pressing into her stomach, separated from her by the gossamer material she was wearing. She growled! She wanted skin to skin contact!\nShe pushed herself up from his embrace, straddling his waist, his cock pressed up against the crack of her ass. She crossed her arms and grabbed the baby doll and pulled it over her head, her breasts bouncing free. She threw the garment off to the side and pounced back onto Michael, kissing his lips, face, neck, and chest. Michael\u0026rsquo;s hands roamed her back, sides, ass, and thighs, stroking her nascent gills, sending shivers throughout her body.\nShe arched her hips up into the air, allowing Michael\u0026rsquo;s cock to flop forward onto his belly, and then pressed her hot, liquid fire on top of it, stroking it with her hips, coating his cock with her juices. Her entire body was quivering with need.\n\u0026ldquo;You do that much longer, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to start over,\u0026rdquo; he said, gasping.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; she asked, confused, unsure. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, was I doing something wrong?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, no! You\u0026rsquo;re amazing,\u0026rdquo; he reassured her, holding her hips still. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to be inside you when I cum. It\u0026rsquo;s the experiment, remember?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right! Well, we can\u0026rsquo;t ruin the experiment,\u0026rdquo; Lucy said, lifting her hips.\nShe glanced down past her dangling breasts and aligned her new opening with the bobbing head of Michael\u0026rsquo;s throbbing cock. After two missed attempts, Michael reached down and held it steady while she lowered her hips onto his cock.\n\u0026ldquo;Oooohhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; she moaned.\nIt burned as it went in, a wonderful, liquid burning, steadily increasing as she lowered her hips. Inch by inch it went in, and up and up leapt the fire. A spurt of fire splashed up her spine, causing her to gasp; she reached her hymen! Her insides were boiling, and she gently pressed down, but the pain spiked in the fire, arresting her movements.\n\u0026ldquo;Ooouuuuucccchhhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; she said, trying to hold her hips steady, fighting the fire that forced her hips downward.\n\u0026ldquo;Relax,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, stroking her sides. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m back under control, take your time.\u0026rdquo;\nShe looked down at him, his eyes now filled with tenderness, making her heart melt. She nodded, flipped her hair back from her face, bit her lip, and slowly pressed her hips down again.\n\u0026ldquo;Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhoooooooooooooo,\u0026rdquo; she said as she felt the steel rod of his penis slowly push through the molten glass of her hymen, shattering it. She froze.\nWhen the prickly, fiery sparks of pain ebbed, she resumed pushing her hips down until her labia were sealed around the bottom of his cock. They both held their position, feeling the incredible connection rising within them. There was the literal and physical connection made by Michael\u0026rsquo;s cock buried deep within her, but it was layered with an ethereal connection twisting up her spine, embracing her heart, and tickling her brain. It was so powerful and so physically transformative that she started crying.\n\u0026ldquo;Lucy?\u0026rdquo; Liz asked, her growing connection to Pearl disrupted by Lucy\u0026rsquo;s wild swings in mood.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s O.K.,\u0026rdquo; Lucy said softly. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just \u0026hellip; so \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s so \u0026hellip; beautiful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, you are,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, shivering herself as Pearl buried another finger in her vagina. \u0026ldquo;And so are you,\u0026rdquo; she said, kissing Pearl deeply.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, you are so beautiful, my little Lucy,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;Lucy the Mermaid! Just look at you!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not a mermaid yet,\u0026rdquo; she said, starting to move her hips. \u0026ldquo;God, you\u0026rsquo;re so big \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s so \u0026hellip; ahhhhhhhh.\u0026rdquo;\nShe collapsed back down onto Michael\u0026rsquo;s chest, her vagina throbbing around his cock. Her first orgasm raced through her, leaving her breathless for a few seconds, but her need blossomed quickly in its wake. She feverishly kissed his face and lips, her hips twitching as his cock stretched and filled her.\nShe gasped as his strong hands grabbed her hips, lifting them up a few inches. She put her weight on her forearms and knees, feeling her breasts dangle and rest on his chest. She continued to devour his face and lips, raining kisses down upon him. Michael raised his knees and levered his hips up into her ass, slapping against it wetly. Lucy lifted her head so she could see his face, her jostling breasts dancing back and forth across his chest. She began moaning uncontrollably, her body shaking, pounded by Michael\u0026rsquo;s pistoning hips. The fire spread from her crotch to her chest, her nipples skittering like hot coals across Michael\u0026rsquo;s body.\nLiz' and Pearl\u0026rsquo;s moans broke through her awareness, and their passion stoked hers higher and higher. Her head buzzed with pleasure as her thighs, ass, and breasts rippled from Michael\u0026rsquo;s relentless assault. After a flurry of lightning thrusts, Michael groaned and pushed himself deeply into her, lifting both of their bodies off the bed. Lucy felt him twitch inside her, grunting as he released his seed. Another spurt erupted inside her, and suddenly her second orgasm gripped her. A tornado spun madly in her belly, and she cried out, her vagina clutching forcefully around Michael\u0026rsquo;s cock. The spinning and clutching, spinning and clutching, spinning and clutching mounted higher and higher until her eyes rolled back in her head, and she collapsed onto Michael\u0026rsquo;s body, riding out the long, wonderful echoes of her second, but more massive female orgasm.\nMichael gently held Lucy as she quivered, moaned, and twitched, the huge orgasm overwhelming her. As her breasts pressed into his chest, he swore he could feel a thread of electricity spark from her chest into his, his own heart leaping in his body. He had never felt closer to another person before in his life, not even Johanna.\nTwo hours later, Michael and his girls arrived back down on the beach as the Basras and a now youthful and fully healed Emma headed for the mountainside huts. They had hung back, respectively keeping their distance as Emma said goodbye to her daughters. Once MuSu\u0026rsquo;s pod had disappeared under the surf, Michael\u0026rsquo;s walked out onto the beach. He set down the bag of clothing they had brought down from the huts and watched as his three girls skipped out into the waves, washing the jungle off their bodies. A few moments later, Bill\u0026rsquo;s pod emerged from the water near them, and Michael hurried to join them, his protective instincts kicking in.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey guys, you all are looking great!\u0026rdquo; Bill said, gazing at the three women who played in the surf. \u0026ldquo;Ouch, what?\u0026rdquo; he complained to Mae who gave him a playful pinch and a glare.\n\u0026ldquo;Get to the point and quit gawking,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, right. So, Michael, Pat asked me to tell you that we\u0026rsquo;re going to keep you topside for a few days,\u0026rdquo; He said, rubbing his side. \u0026ldquo;With the possibility of a lot of unexpected minute traffic here, in the next few days, we thought we should keep some one relatively human.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Makes sense,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll get to wear swimsuits!\u0026rdquo; Pearl gushed. \u0026ldquo;Oh, Lucy, you\u0026rsquo;ll be a mermaid soon enough! Come on, let\u0026rsquo;s see if our gills work yet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, yes, they should be working but you\u0026rsquo;ll need to be careful,\u0026rdquo; Mae said, unhooking a utility bag from Bill\u0026rsquo;s belt. \u0026ldquo;We think these should all fit.\u0026rdquo; They could see several swimsuits in the bag. \u0026ldquo;We made the back straps wider and softer on the bikini\u0026rsquo;s and the neck straps won\u0026rsquo;t hit your gills, so just keep the back strap lightly tied, and it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t irritate your gills too much.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks!\u0026rdquo; Pearl said, taking the bag and rushing back up onto the sand.\n\u0026ldquo;You can spend most of your time naked, if you like,\u0026rdquo; Bill said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll make sure to send someone if we know someone is coming.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about the Basras and Emma?\u0026rdquo; Michael asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll see once they come back from their stage two transitions,\u0026rdquo; Bill said. \u0026ldquo;It depends on how strong Martin feels.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s going to take her son\u0026rsquo;s name?\u0026rdquo; Lucy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, as an homage to her family,\u0026rdquo; Mae answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Right, makes sense. We\u0026rsquo;ll await further instructions,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll continue work on bonding,\u0026rdquo; Liz said with a gleam in her eye.\n\u0026ldquo;Just keep an eye out for the capsules,\u0026rdquo; Bill said. \u0026ldquo;Save them in the little bags, and we\u0026rsquo;ll recharge them and use them again when you transition to mers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Will do,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, watching as Bill\u0026rsquo;s pod returned to the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Timi and Ragi hardly ever say anything,\u0026rdquo; Lucy noted. \u0026ldquo;Why do you think that is?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t really know,\u0026rdquo; Michael admitted. \u0026ldquo;Maybe you can ask them the next time you see them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not working,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said. \u0026ldquo;What am I doing wrong?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not your fault,\u0026rdquo; Rani said, her big, soft, brown eyes filling with tears. \u0026ldquo;We are too weak.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, yes,\u0026rdquo; Vidya chimed in. \u0026ldquo;We cannot overpower you. It is our fault.\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish stood between his two sisters in the center of the rocky pool as the late afternoon sunlight danced all around them. Everyone was bursting with siren cells. Emma watched the three of them from the edge of the jungle, herself equally young, healthy, her face restored to its former beauty, her body brimming with siren cells. Sudhish looked skyward and groaned mightily.\n\u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s me!\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;I cannot \u0026hellip; I am keeping both of you out, I am fighting what is happening to us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you not love us?\u0026rdquo; Vidya asked, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I do love you, my sister,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said, the look on her face breaking his heart. \u0026ldquo;That is the problem. I love you as no brother ought to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But you will no longer be my brother,\u0026rdquo; Vidya said. \u0026ldquo;You will be my sister-wife.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know \u0026hellip; I know,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said, looking down in shame. \u0026ldquo;I cannot submit to you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I do not think submission is in your nature,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;You should not view this as a weakness on your part.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ha! You did not see me powerless in Malaki\u0026rsquo;s office for all those weeks, helpless and afraid,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said bitterly.\n\u0026ldquo;Lacking the power or opportunity to save your sisters does not mean that you are submissive,\u0026rdquo; Emma said.\n\u0026ldquo;But Peter was able to change, and even Valencia was able to change with her pod-mate\u0026rsquo;s help,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish protested. \u0026ldquo;I must be able to succeed at something!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Success comes in many forms,\u0026rdquo; Emma said, her slender, youthful body seeming to possess much more power and stature than a normal twentyfive -year-old girl might have. \u0026ldquo;Your courage in even considering this path makes you, by one measure, successful.\u0026rdquo;\nVidya put a hand on his shoulder, trying to comfort him.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t!\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said, flinching and pulling away. The hurt on her face struck him to his heart. \u0026ldquo;Sorry. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My heart is full of love for you,\u0026rdquo; Vidya said, her oval, innocent face fully restored to health and beauty. \u0026ldquo;Why is there such fear and anger in you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are you feeling, dear brother?\u0026rdquo; Rani asked, taking a step towards him.\nSudhish looked at his beautiful sisters as conflicting emotions battling within. They were beautiful, desirable, and clearly looking at him with affection, but they were also his sisters. His brotherly instincts were under assault, and while his feelings must change, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t let go of his male ego, his sense of honor. He saw the hurt, confusion, and rejection in his sister\u0026rsquo;s eyes, and his overblown sense of personal failure and self-loathing mushroomed.\nWhy do you dislike us?\u0026quot; Rani asked plaintively, adding to anguish in his heart.\n\u0026ldquo;I am trapped by my honor,\u0026rdquo; he said, heavily. \u0026ldquo;I have sworn to replace Geeta, but I cannot stop feeling like your brother. I could not save you before, and now I cannot join you as your sister. I am a failure.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sudhish, you are not a failure. Girls are naturally more flexible in their affections than men,\u0026rdquo; Emma argued. \u0026ldquo;Sudhish, you are perfectly normal, and we should not be surprised that such an honorable and powerful young man should find this transition difficult.\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish looked at the small woman who planned on becoming the merman to his mermaid. Despite her small size, she radiated power, patience, and persistence. She was speaking truth, a truth cutting like a knife into the heart of his inadequacies. Everything seemed an assault on his very core, what he understood himself to be. His emotions and anger threatened to boil over again, but he controlled his anger and forced himself to consider\u0026ndash;again\u0026ndash;both his vow and Emma\u0026rsquo;s wise words.\n\u0026ldquo;It is well that you should be the man in our pod,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said. \u0026ldquo;I only wish I had your strength.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have too much strength, that\u0026rsquo;s the problem,\u0026rdquo; Emma said. \u0026ldquo;Are you certain that you should pursue this path?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have sworn,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said. \u0026ldquo;I will not waver. But I cannot do it to myself. I have failed in yet another task.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I forbid you to say that about yourself again, ever!\u0026rdquo; Emma said, seeming to grow a foot taller as she said it. \u0026ldquo;Do you hear me?\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish both admired and grew jealous of her power. How he wished he had her strength of will. He nodded, and she nodded back.\n\u0026ldquo;Sudhish needs someone bigger to hold him down,\u0026rdquo; Vidya said.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Sudhish said. \u0026ldquo;I am not Sudhish. Sudhish is a fa\u0026hellip;. no. Somehow, I must become Geeta, and it must begin now. Do not speak my male name again.\u0026rdquo;\nBoth his sisters nodded, their eyes full of emotion as they watched him struggle with these deep and powerful forces.\n\u0026ldquo;Geeta\u0026rsquo;s right. She needs help,\u0026rdquo; Rani said, sending all the love and energy she could into her brother.\n\u0026ldquo;Since Geeta requires a man, then perhaps we should provide her with a man,\u0026rdquo; Emma said.\n\u0026ldquo;How will we do that?\u0026rdquo; Vidya asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I will become Martin a little ahead of schedule,\u0026rdquo; Emma said, walking towards the pool.\n\u0026ldquo;But what of the experiment?\u0026rdquo; Rani protested. \u0026ldquo;Will such a change not ruin the planned experiment?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They will understand why we have changed plans,\u0026rdquo; Emma said patiently. \u0026ldquo;Perhaps the data from our bellies has already suggested to them our difficulties. In any event, we can explain ourselves later, if we are successful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What should we do?\u0026rdquo; Sudhish asked.\n\u0026ldquo;First, Sudhish, you must go to the huts, and do not return, no matter what you may hear. I may shout and scream, but there will be nothing happening, your sisters will be safe. I am going to trick myself into battle. Do you understand?\u0026rdquo; She asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; he said, respect growing in his face as he understood what Emma hoped to do.\n\u0026ldquo;If I am successful, we\u0026rsquo;ll call you back,\u0026rdquo; Emma finished.\nSudhish looked at his sisters, seeking and finding their approval for this plan. He nodded, and turned from the pool and hoisted himself out. He took a step towards the path, stopped, and turned back to the pool, his brown, healthy, and entirely-too-male-body dripping water on the rocks under him.\n\u0026ldquo;I will pray for your success,\u0026rdquo; he said, and headed down the path.\nEmma looked down at the food that was to have been eaten by the time Sudhish had made his transition and his sisters had formed their initial bond. From two hours of eating to two minutes; how she would be able to eat half of it in twenty minutes, she wondered? She sat down beside the food and started to eat. After a few minutes she, slowed. She felt sick, and she instantly realized that this was the wrong way to feel. Anger flared in her heart. She would not be the victim of this circumstance.\n\u0026ldquo;Rani, Vidya, first of all, I want you to call me Martin,\u0026rdquo; she said as they nodded. \u0026ldquo;Second, I want you to ferry this food to me in the pool,\u0026rdquo; she said, stepping down into the water. \u0026ldquo;Just feed it to me as I ask for it. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be gaining a lot of mass, or so I hope, and I\u0026rsquo;m too small to eat as much as I think I\u0026rsquo;ll need in such a short time.\u0026rdquo;\nThey both moved over to the edge of the pool by the pile of food, their young, fully restored bodies glistening in the water. Emma looked them both over, trying to imagine herself a male, gazing at his mates. Vidya was all innocence, with enormous round eyes, a long elegant face, a small mouth with full lips. Her body was slender, and her long limbs gave her a coltish air. Rani was the sensible middle sister, her strong chin and placid brown eyes framed by her light brown hair. Her body was round and mature compared to Vidya\u0026rsquo;s leaner lines. They were both beautiful, Emma thought, and they looked so fragile, so innocent looking now that they were healthy again.\nEmma closed her eyes and imagined herself towering over Malaki, rescuing these girls from his evil embrace. She saw, in her mind\u0026rsquo;s eye, Malaki in his hut on the beach, but he wasn\u0026rsquo;t tied up! No, he was crouched down, waiting for someone to come feed him, and he held a gun in his hand! She opened her eyes, shocked at the clarity of the vision she just saw, blinking in the sunlight.\n\u0026ldquo;Food?\u0026rdquo; Rani asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Not yet,\u0026rdquo; Emma said, a hardness creeping into her voice.\nShe closed her eyes again, and this time saw Malaki stalking Vidya in the jungle, closing in on her as she gathered fruit with her sister. Adrenaline surged through her slender body, and Emma pounded the water, battling with the imaginary Malaki. The surprising ferocity of Emma\u0026rsquo;s outburst caused both Rani and Vidya to freeze. They watched as Emma slashed, bashed, and stabbed her enemy, water spraying everywhere.\nAgain and again she advanced on Malaki, on the beach, in the jungle, in the water, at the huts, even here, in the pool! She threw herself from side to side, tackling Malaki\u0026rsquo;s imaginary ankles, pressing her knees into his back, and grinding his face into the dirt. As her muscles began to sting, she felt it start.\n\u0026ldquo;Yessss!\u0026rdquo; she cried victoriously, the tickle racing along her spine up to her skull.\nHe renewed his attack, ripping Malaki\u0026rsquo;s limbs off, kicking his body across the beach, ready to defend his mates regardless of the cost. He took the battle underwater, wrestling with rocks on the bottom, seeing Malaki\u0026rsquo;s face on each one.\nThe bubbles exploded around him, but he refused to \u0026ldquo;give in\u0026rdquo; to the change, seeking the pocket of the transformational forces, the curl of the mighty wave of change wherein he could ride it out, sliding towards the face of the wave or back towards the roiling water. He lifted his face from the water, like a creature from the black lagoon, microorganisms making his face look like it was bubbling.\n\u0026ldquo;Food!\u0026rdquo; he bellowed, his voice deepening as he spoke.\nThe girls rushed forward with their food, and Martin grabbed most of it quickly and stuffed it into his mouth, swallowing without chewing, half of it falling into the roiling water. He caught their eyes and saw both fear and awe; he focused on their awe. The imaginary wave lifted over him, and he dropped back into the water, easing his way back along the channel towards the sweet spot that lay between rocks of pain and the wave\u0026rsquo;s transforming power.\nThe girls watched in fascination as the bubbles roiled around their future mate, \u0026ldquo;eating\u0026rdquo; the food floating in the water. Rani had a sudden inspiration.\n\u0026ldquo;Dump all of it on him,\u0026rdquo; she said, making a trip back to the pile and literally throwing the food at the boiling water. \u0026ldquo;The microorganisms will use it as they help change him. They need biomass to add to his.\u0026rdquo;\nBoth girls started ferrying handfuls of food to the center of the pool. Martin noticed the occasional bits of fish and greens floating near him and immediately guessed at what the girls were doing. Smart girls. He grabbed a large piece of disappearing fish and ate it\u0026ndash;microorganisms and all! He trusted the little buggers would sort it all out in his gut. He rose for more air and more food, and sank back into the whirlpool of bubbles.\nHe felt stretched and his body ached, but there were no sharp pains, nothing that seemed to break. He could feel his body changing, but because nearly everything was getting bigger, literally, the changes didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like an attack on his body. He never even noticed his breasts disappearing. But he noticed the growing feeling of stiffness between his legs as his sexual organs descended and realigned themselves in a new configuration.\nThe bubbles were beginning to slacken, and there didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be any more food left in the water. The microorganisms had consumed and apparently transformed every morsel. He stood up.\nRani and Vidya gasped. Martin was taller than they expected. Emma had only been a little over five foot four inches tall (160 cm), but Martin appeared to be just over six feet tall (183 cm). He had broad shoulders, narrow hips, big hands, dark brown hair, blue eyes, and a face chiseled from granite. He looked a little gaunt, but the mers had warned them that was to be expected. Over the next few days he would put on weight quickly.\n\u0026ldquo;Well?\u0026rdquo; he said, enjoying their look of unabashed admiration.\n\u0026ldquo;Geeta!\u0026rdquo; Vidya shouted. \u0026ldquo;It worked, it worked! Geeta, come here!\u0026rdquo;\nMartin looked himself over, running his hands down his ripped abdomen to his new penis. It felt alien, like an extra limb, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel bad. He smiled, feeling it awaken as he watched Vidya\u0026rsquo;s slender back as she bent over, looking for her brother to emerge from the jungle. He glanced over at Rani who still stood open mouthed, her eyes wide, staring at him.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you, my lady,\u0026rdquo; he said, walking towards her. \u0026ldquo;For the gift of food. I believe your quick thinking may have helped quite a bit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re welcome,\u0026rdquo; she squeaked, looking up at him, her heart pounding.\nHe slowly placed his strong arm around her shoulders and reached down to kiss her. Rani lifted her chin and opened her lips to welcome him. She swooned as his lips touched hers, her knees wobbling. He lifted her up in a hug, and that was the first thing Sudhish noticed as he ran up the path towards the pool.\nSudhish stopped short, caught by the sudden urge to protect his sister. He quickly swallowed that emotion, both because he was pledged to become a sister-wife himself and because he realized that Martin had thirty pounds and a few inches advantage. He looked at Vidya and saw her happy innocent smile. He smiled back at her. She seemed genuinely happy that he was about to join her both in sisterhood and in a bond stronger than any human vow. He resolved to keep her smile on his sister\u0026rsquo;s face. He saw Rani turn and notice his arrival.\n\u0026ldquo;Geeta!\u0026rdquo; she said, welcoming her soon-to-be-sister-wife. \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t he gorgeous?\u0026rdquo;\nHe kept his thoughts to himself, and focused on unclenching his fists. Martin noticed his action, but said nothing. Sudhish walked to the pool, keeping the raging forces tightly controlled in his own body. He tried to keep his face expressionless, but he felt the heat of anger rise along his neck. He looked down at his younger sister, manufacturing another smile for her.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you angry?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he lied. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Trying to be a good brother,\u0026rdquo; Martin said, his rich baritone voice ringing out. \u0026ldquo;I think I know how you feel. Do you still want to go through with this?\u0026rdquo;\nSudhish hesitated, the brief struggle visible on his face. He shook it off, set his jaw, and stepped forward and into the pool. He walked erect until he stood next to Martin. Vidya had come up behind him while Rani stood at his side. He looked Martin in eye, and then saw a glint of compassion behind the steely-eyed strength that the new man projected. He really was offering Sudhish a choice.\n\u0026ldquo;Do it,\u0026rdquo; he said softly. \u0026ldquo;Do what I can not.\u0026rdquo;\nMartin looked at him and remembered the beauty that had been his sister. He fixed the image in his mind, and brought Sudhish into a hug. Sudhish remained stiff and unyielding, but Martin glanced at the other two women who wordlessly backed away at his non-verbal command. Then, without warning, he wrenched Sudhish from his feet and plunged them both into the water.\nPanic surged through Sudhish and he struggled against Martin\u0026rsquo;s embrace, but the bigger man was too strong, and Sudhish felt the tingle along his spine rise up and burst, like a tiny firework, in his skull.\nGeeta stopped struggling as bubbles violently erupted around her. Martin loosened his grip, and guided her face towards the surface.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my gosh,\u0026rdquo; Vidya said. \u0026ldquo;Those bubbles seem stronger than before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Their life cycle depends on someone changing, and so they get more numerous with each change,\u0026rdquo; Rani said, remembering some of what Pat had explained on the beach. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s give more focus to Geeta. Martin might not remember how she looked.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone remembered how Geeta looked,\u0026rdquo; Vidya said without malice. \u0026ldquo;She was always the most beautiful woman in the room.\u0026rdquo;\nThey joined Martin at Geeta\u0026rsquo;s side, each taking a leg and an arm while Martin remained at her head. They watched as the water foamed around her, her body twisting, turning, morphing, shrinking, and changing into a near duplicate of their deceased sister. They caught glimpses of her legs shrinking, her hips expanding, her waist and shoulders narrowing, her neck lengthening, and her hair growing. After many minutes, the water calmed down, and they could see the new Geeta clearly for the first time.\nMartin gently lifted her head up from the water, and she put her feet under her and stood up. She was the tallest sister now, but she was still a good deal shorter than Martin. Her dark brown hair fell in thick, wet curls over her shoulders, down her back, and over her breasts. Her face was now a beautiful oval with wide set, deep mysterious eyes flashing with flecks of gold and brown. Her face would never be considered innocent. Her shoulders were strong but feminine, and her waist seemed impossibly small, especially when compared to her generous hips. Her breasts were only slightly smaller than Rani\u0026rsquo;s, but the overall effect was astounding.\nGeeta looked at each of her new pod-mates as they gazed at her, feeling their emotions with her new proto-mer senses. She grew uncomfortable as they stared, and she slowly began to understand both the joy and the frustration her sister must have felt. She felt admiration, desire, and even lust from all three of them, and at the same time she clearly felt her sister\u0026rsquo;s feelings of inadequacy and jealousy.\nThe latter feelings she would never tolerate, not after everything that she had just been through. She grabbed her sister\u0026rsquo;s hands and held them fiercely.\n\u0026ldquo;We have proto-mer senses now, and I don\u0026rsquo;t ever want to feel those feelings coming from you ever again!\u0026rdquo; she said, shaking their hands to emphasize her point. \u0026ldquo;Look within yourselves to find the true beauty in the world, and remember I love you both more than I love myself. You are both equally as beautiful as I!\u0026rdquo;\nShe forced them both to look at her eyes, and waited until she saw a pact, an agreement of principle in their eyes. She turned to Martin, feeling a new strength she never quite understood before flow from his gaze and into her heart. She smiled, not knowing that her smile had quite literally become a devastating weapon of mass, emotional upheaval.\n\u0026ldquo;Will you please show Vidya how beautiful she is while I kiss some sense into Rani?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\nMartin blinked, nearly overwhelmed by this radiant and sexual creature who stood before him. Only moments ago, he had been the potential object of male lust, but now his own libido exploded as her smile washed over him. His cock instantly sprang to life, and when Vidya gasped, he knew she thought it was because of her. He wisely chose not to correct her.\nHe shifted his gaze to Vidya, and was reassured when his new appendage stiffened further, both because Vidya was herself beautiful and she was looking at him with unabashed wonder. He felt like a rock star. He looked back over to Rani and Geeta, the former also looking at him with undisguised admiration, but Geeta was looking at him with mischief in her amazing eyes. He briefly toyed with the notion of pointing out that up until a few moments ago, he was the one who was making the decisions for the pod. But when Geeta mouthed \u0026ldquo;please\u0026rdquo; without speaking, her eyes fluttering and her wide, sensuous mouth blowing a kiss in his direction, the thought evaporated.\nWell, he used to be a woman, he thought, and he wondered how Geeta learned that particular trick so quickly. He reached out to Vidya and brought his new pod-mate into an embrace and kissed her. Like her older sister, Vidya too swooned, her legs buckling beneath her.\nGeeta, smiled, feeling the power of her new body as the sexual tension in the pool blossomed fully. Her heart and mind were finally in agreement and a sense of peace rose alongside the rising passion. She turned her towards Rani\u0026ndash;the sensible one\u0026ndash;and projected as much love and desire as she could. Rani\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened as she felt the unspoken force of this gorgeous creature showering her with love, Geeta\u0026rsquo;s eyes a fountain of desire and love. Rani took a step back, nearly overcome with emotion.\nGeeta stepped closer to Rani and put a hand on her sister-wife\u0026rsquo;s shoulder, turning her so they faced one another. Geeta saw that she was an few centimeters taller, but that Rani\u0026rsquo;s figure was fuller, rounder, and softer than her own. She gathered Rani into her arms, determined to purge the look of awe from her sister\u0026rsquo;s eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Your eyes always said exactly what was in your heart, no matter what you wanted to hold back,\u0026rdquo; she said, kissing each one as she spoke. \u0026ldquo;But I want you to close your eyes, and see with your mer-senses what I see as I kiss you.\u0026rdquo;\nRani kept each eye closed after the butterfly light kisses had left her eyelids, and she cooed as the soft, gentle kisses moved over her face, her ears, her neck, and down along her breasts. She tried to hold still as Geeta\u0026rsquo;s tongue flicked every so lightly across her nipples, kisses continuing down across her belly, around her navel, and then to where the water rippled across her wide hips. Geeta traced her way back up her sister\u0026rsquo;s body, sending all the love and warmth she could into each kiss. By the time she returned to her sister\u0026rsquo;s lips, Rani was no longer awed or cowed by her sister\u0026rsquo;s beauty, she was going to devour it.\nGeeta thrilled to the force with which Rani returned her kisses, and for several minutes they kissed and nibbled on each other, pressing their bodies together, listening to their youngest sister moan and pant as Martin expertly seduced her.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe what I\u0026rsquo;m feeling,\u0026rdquo; Rani said, panting. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re my sister, my wife, my lover, my brother \u0026hellip; you\u0026rsquo;re amazing, and I want you so badly!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t talk about it, show me,\u0026rdquo; Geeta said, kissing her again.\n\u0026ldquo;I shall,\u0026rdquo; Rani growled, pushing Geeta back towards the rocky wall along the outward facing edge of the pool.\nShe took control, and Geeta let her, secure in knowing that she was a little stronger than either of her sisters, but relishing the ardent fervor she felt coming from Rani. Rani buried her face in Geeta\u0026rsquo;s breasts, lavishing kisses and licks along her sternum, under each breast, up along the areolas, forcefully sucking on her nipples.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh \u0026hellip; oh \u0026hellip; yesssss,\u0026rdquo; Geeta hissed, her breasts tingling under the onslaught.\nRani pushed Geeta\u0026rsquo;s hips until they rested against the wall, and then she urged her sister-wife to sit up on the smooth surface of the sunwarmed rocks. Rani then ran her hands down her torso, over her hips, down her legs to her knees and spread her sister\u0026rsquo;s legs apart, exposing her new sex to view.\n\u0026ldquo;Beautiful,\u0026rdquo; she breathed, and she sank to her knees in the pool and kissed Geeta\u0026rsquo;s vagina like a starving woman.\n\u0026ldquo;Ohhhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; she cried as her sex was touched for the first time.\nGeeta looked down into Rani\u0026rsquo;s eyes as her sister-wife began to passionately kiss, lick, and caress her most intimate of places. Each nibble and lick sent her further and further into a spiral of pleasure, threatening to throw her from the wall and into the jungle below. A sudden movement caught her eye, and she watched as Martin stood in the center of the pool, lifting Vidya\u0026rsquo;s slender body by her hips, her legs draped over his arms, and then lowered her onto his cock. Vidya wrapped her legs around his back as he began stroking her up and down his long cock.\nRani sucked her clitoris into her mouth, and Geeta pushed her pelvis towards Rani. She wrapped her own legs around her sister\u0026rsquo;s shoulders and lay back on the wall, her breasts pointing at the sky as she rolled her hips up and down, Rani\u0026rsquo;s lips firmly capturing her stiff little button. Her orgasm burst in her womb like a bomb, the shock wave rippling outward from her crotch. She clutched at the wall, trying to make the earth steady, but Rani refused to let up, and a second explosion rocked her body. Geeta cried out as a third build up rose in her and then detonated across her hips.\nShe felt something warm flickering over her face and body and wondered if it started raining. No, she thought as Rani kissed and caressed her body as the aftershocks rolled across her, the sun was shining. She looked down her body and saw the fine streams of milk arcing from her own nipples like twin fountains. Mermaid milk, she thought. Soon, they would be mermaids.\n\u0026ldquo;What does your mer-senses tell you now?\u0026rdquo; Rani asked.\nGeeta wrapped her legs around Rani\u0026rsquo;s hips as she sank into the water next to her sister-wife, kissing her softly and gently on her forehead, nose, and then lips as she slid down from the wall. She leaned back and looked into Rani\u0026rsquo;s soft, brown eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;You love me,\u0026rdquo; she said simply. \u0026ldquo;And I love you, so much.\u0026rdquo;\nAs they kissed again, both girls snaked a hand into the other\u0026rsquo;s vagina and quickly and effortlessly brought each other to several satisfying orgasms. As they savored their growing bonds, they watched Vidya shudder and scream through a tenth or eleventh amazing orgasm, while Martin worked to keep them both upright. When his own orgasm erupted, his first one as a male, he finally lost his footing. Geeta and Rani rushed over to keep both their heads in the air, since Vidya refused to release her legs that were clamped around his arms and torso.\nWhen they had all recovered, they shared a group kiss, their limbs intertwined as they relaxed in the water, watching the sun continue its journey across the afternoon sky.\nJackson Baker looked over the seven other people assembled in his kitchen, watching six of them digest the long list of conditions and promises he had just outlined. Some in the group were eager to agree to their terms, others were being more thoughtful. Kyle\u0026rsquo;s face was typically impassive, the late afternoon sun casting deep shadows across his wrinkles. He\u0026rsquo;d make the world\u0026rsquo;s best poker player, Jack thought.\n\u0026ldquo;And you need an answer right now?\u0026rdquo; asked Carl Thomas, a retired marine biologist and Jack\u0026rsquo;s former colleague.\n\u0026ldquo;Yep,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m afraid so. Either you say yes today, and your life will never be the same, or you say no, and Kyle here takes you back to the mainland.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, Uncle Kyle,\u0026rdquo; began Angela Johnson, a young woman in her late twenties. \u0026ldquo;Let me see if I have this right. If we say yes, we will be changed somehow, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said. \u0026ldquo;For the better, I\u0026rsquo;m saying.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So you say,\u0026rdquo; Angela said. \u0026ldquo;But because we will be different, we can never return to human civilization.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s right,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said.\n\u0026ldquo;On the other hand, we will appear to be about twenty-five, we\u0026rsquo;ll live for a really long time, we will gain new physical and mental abilities, which could give us a real chance to save the whales,\u0026rdquo; said Angela ticking off on her fingers.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a good list,\u0026rdquo; Kyle.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;d love to save the whales, but you had me at \u0026lsquo;never return to human civilization,'\u0026rdquo; said Angela forcefully. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t tell you the number of times I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to escape from all the bullshit and the sick, twisted \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Angie,\u0026rdquo; Kyle interrupted. \u0026ldquo;I know your father, my brother, and I\u0026rsquo;m sorry for you. I can\u0026rsquo;t fix what he done to you, but I can give you a second chance.\u0026rdquo;\nNo, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry Uncle Kyle,\u0026quot; she said, bowing her head. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;d think ten years of therapy would help, but \u0026hellip; anyway, you were always the biggest help to me, and I \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t think about it again,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said. \u0026ldquo;I just did what I could, nothing more.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, well, I\u0026rsquo;m in, all in,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Me too, for the same, fucking reasons,\u0026rdquo; said Belle Lanham, Angela\u0026rsquo;s best friend.\nA few moments passed as the others mulled over their options. Dr. Carl Thomas had retired from teaching biology at Washington College. Like Jackson, he was in his sixties, single, and with relatively few ties to the world. Unlike Jackson, he wasn\u0026rsquo;t wealthy, but he was one of the few people who had seen Jackson\u0026rsquo;s hidden aquarium. Annie Baker, Jack\u0026rsquo;s cousin, also shared that experience. She was a handsome woman in her late fifties, and she recently retired from teaching music in the public schools. Like her cousin, she shared a lifelong passion for the sea and its creatures. Unlike her cousin, she had few opportunities to indulge that passion.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll do it,\u0026rdquo; Annie said. \u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t want to clean the house this weekend anyway.\u0026rdquo;\nSasha Johanson and Sara Abrams, who were old friends with both Annie and Kyle, looked at each other, and then at Kyle. They nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m in, too,\u0026rdquo; Carl said.\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said. \u0026ldquo;Now, does anyone need to say goodbye to anyone or tidy up any business?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As long as we didn\u0026rsquo;t need to pack an extra set of clothes,\u0026rdquo; Angela joked.\n\u0026ldquo;You won\u0026rsquo;t need any clothes,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;But you won\u0026rsquo;t be naked, exactly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then I don\u0026rsquo;t need to say a fucking goodbye to anyone,\u0026rdquo; said Angela looking around the room as others also nodded their heads in agreement.\n\u0026ldquo;I think you prepared us enough that our disappearances won\u0026rsquo;t cause much trouble, at least not for a while,\u0026rdquo; Carl said.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, then \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s time for the rest of the story,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said, rising from his kitchen table. \u0026ldquo;Follow me.\u0026rdquo;\nHe led the group down into the basement and opened the secret door, which caused a few gasps and oohs and aahs. They proceeded down the passageway into the main viewing room for the huge tank. Once everyone was in the room, Jack punched a few keys on the control panel, closing the blast doors.\n\u0026ldquo;Is that so we don\u0026rsquo;t run screaming?\u0026rdquo; Amanda joked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, that\u0026rsquo;s so no one disturbs us,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;Watch the tank.\u0026rdquo;\nEveryone turned and looked at the large, brightly lit tank. Thousands of fish swam in the water, some making slow circles around the perimeter, others darting back and forth among the coral, rocks, and plants that peppered the artificial landscape. After several moments passed, a cuttlefish darted to the center of the tank, snagged a small fish, and disappeared back into the rocks from which it had sprung.\n\u0026ldquo;Is that what you wanted to show us?\u0026rdquo; Sasha asked. \u0026ldquo;An octopus?\u0026rdquo;\nJackson smiled, and shook his head. Sasha, Sara, and Annie were all old friends and excellent musicians. Sadly, Sasha and Sara didn\u0026rsquo;t share his cousin\u0026rsquo;s knowledge of and passion for sea creatures. However, between the three of them, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t an instrument they couldn\u0026rsquo;t play, and most of them they could play very well.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a cuttlefish,\u0026rdquo; Jackson patiently. \u0026ldquo;Look carefully. Do you see others hiding among the coral and rocks?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Other cuttlefish?\u0026rdquo; Sara asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said, trying not to smile.\nThey all walked up to the tank, and some even put their hands on the glass as they searched the tank. Jackson and Kyle hung back, waiting. After a few moments, four long brown tails snapped into view, right in front of the glass. Everyone jumped back and Sara and Sasha screamed with surprise.\n\u0026ldquo;What the fu \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Angela started, but the sight before her froze her tongue.\nMac, Joy, Annette, and Bonnie hung gracefully in the water, one hand stretched over their heads, clinging to the top of the tank wall. Their long hair floated about them like lace, and their long tails gently moved back and forth, making it clear that these were not fake mermaids at all. Several seconds passed and no human moved.\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re \u0026hellip; they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Carl stuttered.\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re fucking beautiful!\u0026rdquo; Angela said. \u0026ldquo;Is THIS what we are going to change into?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said, no longer hiding his glee.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s fucking AWESOME,\u0026rdquo; said Angela pulling up her sleeve on her shirt. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve already fucking got one here!\u0026rdquo;\nShe brandished a tattoo of a mermaid that looked very much like the ones in the tank.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah!\u0026rdquo; said Belle pulling up her own sleeve.\nThey turned back to the tank, staring at the four mers.\n\u0026ldquo;They are beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Carl said, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, amazing,\u0026rdquo; Sasha said.\n\u0026ldquo;How did they do that?\u0026rdquo; Carl asked.\nJack nodded at Mac. The mers all retracted their hands from the air, and winked out of view.\n\u0026ldquo;Holy, fucking shit!\u0026rdquo; Angela said.\n\u0026ldquo;Angie \u0026hellip; language,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said gently.\n\u0026ldquo;Fuck, sorry,\u0026rdquo; Angela said.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll explain as we go,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said, giving another signal.\nThe mers reappeared at the top of the tank, smiling down at everyone.\n\u0026ldquo;Make a hole,\u0026rdquo; Mac bellowed.\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone move over there,\u0026rdquo; Joy said pointing, even as her mate ducked back under, disappearing, and then bursting forth from the water seconds later, somersaulting over the wall onto the floor in front of Kyle, water splashing everywhere.\n\u0026ldquo;Best get used to water!\u0026rdquo; Mac said.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s gonna be a long night,\u0026rdquo; Joy said.\n\u0026ldquo;So, two of you will share one breast per mermaid now, and then two different people later tonight, and then two other people tomorrow morning,\u0026rdquo; Joy explained.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait, that\u0026rsquo;s only seven of eight people feeding,\u0026rdquo; Sara said. \u0026ldquo;Who\u0026rsquo;s going to get left behind?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No one,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s Mac.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mac?\u0026rdquo; asked Sara. \u0026ldquo;How does anyone feed from a merman?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously?\u0026rdquo; Angela said, laughing. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re fucking serious?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Angie \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Kyle said.\n\u0026ldquo;Siren cells are in his semen,\u0026rdquo; Angela said. \u0026ldquo;You just have to \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think we all understand the basics,\u0026rdquo; Carl interrupted. \u0026ldquo;But we\u0026rsquo;re going to need to sort out how we\u0026rsquo;re going to do this. I count three men and five women, and if I\u0026rsquo;ve understood everything so far, we need two men and six women.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have correctly assessed the situation,\u0026rdquo; Joy agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;You knew this?\u0026rdquo; asked Carl turning to Jack.\n\u0026ldquo;Yep,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s it? Just yep?\u0026rdquo; Carl demanded.\n\u0026ldquo;Yep,\u0026rdquo; said Jack giving his old friend a long look.\n\u0026ldquo;This is awkward,\u0026rdquo; Angela said, fussing with her hair.\n\u0026ldquo;Aw, Carl,\u0026rdquo; Kyle urged.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean, Aw, Carl?\u0026rdquo; Carl demanded. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re on his side now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just saying,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you saying?\u0026rdquo; Carl asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not saying,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m saying.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What am I not saying?\u0026rdquo; Carl demanded. \u0026ldquo;God, you\u0026rsquo;ve never said this many words in a row to me in your life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Kyle said, his neck reddening.\n\u0026ldquo;What, that I\u0026rsquo;m gay?\u0026rdquo; Carl said. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s that got to do with anything? Being gay means I like men, not that I want to be a woman or a mermaid myself. How long have you known me, Kyle?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Long time,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Right, and in that long time have you ever heard me talking about becoming a woman?\u0026rdquo; Carl asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Nope,\u0026rdquo; Kyle answered, embarrassed.\n\u0026ldquo;Right. Exactly zero times,\u0026rdquo; Carl said.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; Kyle said.\n\u0026ldquo;So, what\u0026rsquo;s your excuse?\u0026rdquo; asked Carl turning to Jack again.\n\u0026ldquo;Got none,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said. \u0026ldquo;I knew you liked me, and well, you being a mermaid was the only way I was going to like you back.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; said Carl surprised. \u0026ldquo;You want me to be your mermaid?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yep,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, shit,\u0026rdquo; Carl said.\nAngela and Belle giggled.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Carl said.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re cute when you swear,\u0026rdquo; Belle said.\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks,\u0026rdquo; Carl said. \u0026ldquo;So, everyone planned this out without telling me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nope,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d never do that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, everything seems so neat and tidy except for me,\u0026rdquo; Carl complained.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; Jackson asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You got three girls who are all musicians, one of whom is your cousin,\u0026rdquo; said Carl nodding at Jackson. \u0026ldquo;They go with Kyle, because we want to avoid incest and despite being an very ornery oysterman, he can sing like a dream. So, that keeps things nice and tidy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So?\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that brings us to Angela and Belle \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; started Carl.\n\u0026ldquo;Too late to avoid incest,\u0026rdquo; Angela said.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, yes \u0026hellip; I caught that. Sorry about \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Carl stammered.\n\u0026ldquo;Forget about it,\u0026rdquo; Angela said. \u0026ldquo;Go on.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, they are both Greenpeace activists, and Angela, if I remember correctly, studied marine biology at UM Eastern Shore,\u0026rdquo; Carl continued.\n\u0026ldquo;You remember correctly,\u0026rdquo; Angela confirmed.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to make a wild guess and say Belle studied something similar,\u0026rdquo; Carl continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Ecology, never finished,\u0026rdquo; Belle said.\n\u0026ldquo;Right. And I taught biology for nearly forty years,\u0026rdquo; said Carl giving \u0026lsquo;the look\u0026rsquo; at Jackson. \u0026ldquo;So, obviously the three of us go with you, with you being the merman. Now, you can\u0026rsquo;t tell me you didn\u0026rsquo;t think about all that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thought did cross my mind,\u0026rdquo; Jack said, smiling a tiny bit.\n\u0026ldquo;What made you think I\u0026rsquo;d agree to this?\u0026rdquo; Carl asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Freshman year,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\n\u0026ldquo;Now, that\u0026rsquo;s not fair,\u0026rdquo; Carl protested. \u0026ldquo;I was drunk. Hell, I was plastered.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re the one who said it,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\n\u0026ldquo;Fine. Just fine,\u0026rdquo; said Carl crossing his arms and pouting.\nSeveral seconds passed in silence.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, what did you fucking say?\u0026rdquo; Angela asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I asked him if he would kiss me if I was a woman,\u0026rdquo; Carl confessed.\nAngela looked back and forth between the two men, clearly enjoying the moment.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, what did you tell him?\u0026rdquo; Angela asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yep,\u0026rdquo; Jackson said.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t look down,\u0026rdquo; said Joy softly. \u0026ldquo;It won\u0026rsquo;t kill you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Mac whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you wish to explain to me why you\u0026rsquo;re happy to let another woman suck your cock?\u0026rdquo; asked Joy arching an eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;No, no. It\u0026rsquo;s just \u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026hellip; Goddamnit,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Look, it\u0026rsquo;s sort of like his request for a last meal,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, smiling. \u0026ldquo;He really likes men, and you are a really, manly man.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Flatterer,\u0026rdquo; Mac said.\n\u0026ldquo;Quit stalling and get going,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, shooing him towards Carl.\nMac sighed and salamandered away, carefully picking his way among the mers and humans sprawled out over the floor of the viewing room. When he reached Carl, he flipped over and sat down, his long tail slapping on the cement.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, have at it,\u0026rdquo; Mac said, leaning up against a wall.\nCarl looked over the recumbent merman, searching for some clue as to where his penis might be.\n\u0026ldquo;Um, I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to know where to begin,\u0026rdquo; Carl said, embarrassed.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right. Sorry,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s in here, but I have to \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nMac furrowed his brow, trying to get his vent to open. He could get the slit to appear, a tiny crack in his scales opening about fifteen centimeters below his belly button, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t get his penis aroused. He looked over at Joy and saw that she had both Jackson and Angela, one on each breast. He felt a pang of jealousy, which didn\u0026rsquo;t help matters.\n\u0026ldquo;Give me a second,\u0026rdquo; he said, closing his eyes.\nHe remembered back to when Joy and he made love on the airplane to Hong Kong, in that fancy little room on the enormous plane. She had been insatiable, and their slowly youthening bodies had provided them with hours of pleasure. That was a great day. Later, in the hotel, she gave him that amazing blow job in the shower. Yeah, one that felt a lot like the one he was getting now.\nIt worked, but Mac decided not to open his eyes. After only a few seconds more, however, he was ready to admit that Carl certainly knew what he was doing. In a very short time, Carl had successfully earned his first feeding, and Mac returned to the tank to renew his bonds with his girls.\nCarl hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed anything unusual until Jack had sat down next to him and put his arm around his shoulders. A tingle in his spine rose up to his skull and pricked his brain with a tiny explosion. It was over in a flash, and Carl laid his head on Jack\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. He watched as Angela and Belle came over and sat down on Jack\u0026rsquo;s other side. The four of them sat together for many minutes, watching the light show in the tank.\n\u0026ldquo;That mermaid milk is amazing,\u0026rdquo; Angela said, her voice softer and richer than it had been before.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s like all the anger and pain just flowed right out of me,\u0026rdquo; said Angela her voice tinged with awe. \u0026ldquo;Fucking so much better than fucking therapy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; Belle agreed. \u0026ldquo;Fucking therapy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\nA few more moments passed.\n\u0026ldquo;Belle, do your tats hurt?\u0026rdquo; Angela asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, what\u0026rsquo;s that about?\u0026rdquo; Belle asked.\n\u0026ldquo;What are tats?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Tattoos,\u0026rdquo; Angela said. \u0026ldquo;Man, you are so old school.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, tattoos. Well, the siren cells are healing your body and your mind,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;The tats will probably be gone by morning.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Bummer,\u0026rdquo; Angela said. \u0026ldquo;I liked those tats.\u0026rdquo;\nA few more moments passed, the light show in the tank showing that Mac had changed partners again. Each of the humans were lost in their own thoughts, wondering what it would be like to actually be mers, to be making love with as much passion, energy, and stamina as the mers in the tank.\n\u0026ldquo;Cassie,\u0026rdquo; Carl said.\n\u0026ldquo;Hum?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what you can call me later,\u0026rdquo; Carl said. \u0026ldquo;Cassie.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;All right,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\nAngela started humming, and a few seconds later, Carl laughed out loud.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s so funny?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A, B, C,\u0026rdquo; Carl sang.\n\u0026ldquo;Easy as 1, 2, 3,\u0026rdquo; Angela sang.\n\u0026ldquo;Or simple as do re mi,\u0026rdquo; Belle sang.\n\u0026ldquo;A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, baby, you and me girl!\u0026rdquo; they all sang together.\n\u0026ldquo;How much time left?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, looking up from her screen, casting a critical eye around the lab cave.\n\u0026ldquo;Ten minutes,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said, her own head buried behind a computer screen.\n\u0026ldquo;Jaclyn, have you got everything you need?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, looking across the low metal table at her former Greenpeace friend and activist.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, ma\u0026rsquo;am,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said with a mock salute.\n\u0026ldquo;Very funny,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;This is serious. It could be deadly serious.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going to do fine,\u0026rdquo; Jaclyn said. \u0026ldquo;They will believe you, and we will be left alone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If wishes were horses,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, returning to her computer.\n\u0026ldquo;Will you please let me fix your hair?\u0026rdquo; Danni asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Only if you can do it while I work,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\nDanni smiled at John, handing him Freya, and kicked herself out of the pool onto the cave floor. She reached behind her back and pulled a comb and a crown of brightly colored tiare, hibiscus, and frangipani blossoms. She salamandered over to her sister-wife, set the crown on the floor, and carefully combed and braided Pat\u0026rsquo;s temples, and then pulled the thin braids back behind her ears and then joined them in a long, single braid that went down along her dorsal ridge. As Pat continued reading her notes on the computer screen, Danni carefully positioned the crown of flowers so that it covered Pat\u0026rsquo;s silvery headband. She pulled a few strands of hair forward from behind her ears, and then arranged Pat\u0026rsquo;s thick, flowing tresses over her shoulders and breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you done yet?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Almost. Hold still,\u0026rdquo; Danni said. She wet her thumb and smoothed out each of Pat\u0026rsquo;s eyebrows, and then pinched each of her cheeks.\n\u0026ldquo;Ouch! Is that really necessary?\u0026rdquo; Pat complained.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re on Candid Camera!\u0026rdquo; Danni teased. \u0026ldquo;You have to look ravishing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She always looks ravishing,\u0026rdquo; said Phoebe positioning her own crown of flowers in her hair.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, you\u0026rsquo;re finished,\u0026rdquo; Danni said. \u0026ldquo;I love you, and I\u0026rsquo;m proud to be your pod-mate. Now, knock em dead.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You metaphor could use some work, but your sentiment is most appreciated,\u0026rdquo; said Pat turning away from her screen and kissing Danni. \u0026ldquo;I love you too. Now, you watch the kids, and I\u0026rsquo;ll talk to the stuffed shirts.\u0026rdquo;\nDanni salamandered over to Phoebe, gave her a kiss too, and then rejoined John in the pool. Pat surveyed the room again. Galina and Alexis wore their crowns over their headbands and were positioned at the table directly behind the one where Pat perched. Phoebe was at the table to Pat\u0026rsquo;s left. The place was clean, organized, and looked like a modern facility. She hoped it would be convincing.\nShe reached up and touched the flowers on her head. It was a nice touch. Not only did it reinforce an idyllic, peace-loving image but also it hid their headbands. Despite the relatively low quality of the video connection, they didn\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to see the pattern Rose had created that seemed to be the major factor in enhancing and extending their mer senses. Hopefully, they could keep that a secret. She almost regretted sending the headbands to Taylor\u0026rsquo;s Island, but it was too late. They would arrive within the next few hours, probably not long after this polycom conference.\nShe took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and centered her thoughts. Focus on the science, the carrots, as Bart advised, and use purposefully vague language about The Device. Do not, under any circumstances, divulge how it worked or might be unleashed. Agreements, signatures, and treaties first, and then details on The Device later. No problem, right?\nHer stomach flipped as she thought, for a moment, about what would happen if the damn thing ever went off. It would be the end of nearly every living thing on the planet, and they had created it. She looked at Galina and Alexis, both looking so innocent, so beautiful, as they made their final preparations for the conference. They invented it, she thought.\nNo, Pat reminded herself that she had agreed with them and with both John and Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s passionate arguments in support of a meaningful weapon. I am equally responsible for all this, she reminded herself. She hoped that John and Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s arguments hadn\u0026rsquo;t been grounded too deeply in an irrational, testosterone-laden aggression. Heavens, this was going to be harder than she thought.\nNo, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just that argument, she had to admit to herself. She also felt that deep, almost irrational need to protect too. She felt it every time she picked up Maureen, every time her sweet little daughter suckled at her breast, every time she heard the silvery laughter her daughter seemed prone to sharing, and every time she watched all her children play together. She knew how most people feared what they did not know or understand, and she was determined that prejudice and hate would have to fight their way through her own body before they harmed her pod.\nShe set her chin and launched Skype, watching the icon bounce on her toolbar. After a few seconds, she saw that Bart was online and clicked on his name. The window opened up, and his face popped into view. He was wearing a suit and tie and his hair was neatly combed.\n\u0026ldquo;You look like a businessman,\u0026rdquo; said Pat in greeting.\n\u0026ldquo;I feel like a politician,\u0026rdquo; Bart said. \u0026ldquo;You look like an island queen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks. I feel like a bug about to hit a windshield,\u0026rdquo; Pat admitted.\n\u0026ldquo;I think that your windshield is bigger and badder than their windshield,\u0026rdquo; said Bart reassuringly.\n\u0026ldquo;That only works if they see it in time, and veer away from it,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Otherwise, we all smash into it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You ready?\u0026rdquo; asked Bart looking at his watch.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I am,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on, Jack \u0026hellip; pick up the call,\u0026rdquo; Pat muttered, watching the screen. God, that had been an excruciating hour, she thought. Where was Jack?\n\u0026ldquo;Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m back,\u0026rdquo; Jack\u0026rsquo;s face appeared on the screen. \u0026ldquo;Sorry, something kicked me off. Let\u0026rsquo;s be very clear and precise in what we say, just in case, alright?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re bugged?\u0026rdquo; asked Pat warily?\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;We usually don\u0026rsquo;t say that out loud, but instead we are carefully clear and precise.\u0026rdquo; He gave the camera a look.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, right,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Sorry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As Lurch used to say; you rang?\u0026rdquo; said Jack trying to keep it light.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sorry,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;I just wanted to know what you and the gang thought about how it went.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Me, on a scale of one to ten, a five,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;The gang?\u0026rdquo; He looked over his shoulder and then turned back to the camera. \u0026ldquo;Fours and fives.\u0026rdquo;\nPat looked at Jack carefully, trying to read his face. Oh my god, she realized. He\u0026rsquo;s younger! He\u0026rsquo;s drinking mermaid milk. No wonder he wants to be careful.\n\u0026ldquo;That bad?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It was more bad than good,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, feeling much the same way.\n\u0026ldquo;We should talk later,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll contact you in twelve hours, is that alright?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fine,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Talk to you then.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Bye,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. He gave another look at the camera and terminated the call.\n\u0026ldquo;Shit,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you upset about?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked. \u0026ldquo;I thought it went well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think Mr. Baker was being most generous,\u0026rdquo; Galina said, taking off her crown of flowers. \u0026ldquo;I would give it a three.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why a three?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m confused. We just spent an hour talking to scientists, generals, and politicians from Russia, the United States, and China. They were all very respectful, and they really liked some of the inventions. Taiping Su was very excited about his sea anemones.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Phoebe,\u0026rdquo; Pat sighed. \u0026ldquo;Nearly everyone on that call was wavering between terror and disbelief. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t you hear it in their voices?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;I thought that Anatoly guy believed everything you said.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Da,\u0026rdquo; Galina agreed. \u0026ldquo;But he was the only one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What are we going to do?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Da,\u0026rdquo; Galina said.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, what did you think?\u0026rdquo; Bart asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Damn, those were some seriously beautiful mamacitas,\u0026rdquo; Lucia said.\n\u0026ldquo;No, not the mermaids, the others. What was your impression of them, of how they received the information?\u0026rdquo; Bart pressed.\nLucia pursed her lips and thought. She looked into her boss\u0026rsquo; face, searching for some clue as to how she should respond.\n\u0026ldquo;Like, you really wanna know what this chavala thinks about all those gabachos, eh?\u0026rdquo; Lucia asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, and you can tone down the street speak,\u0026rdquo; he said, smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;I think we better have a whole lotta money,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Otherwise, we gonna be in jail for a long time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why do you think that?\u0026rdquo; Bart asked.\n\u0026ldquo;That general guy, the one that got so mad at Mac the Merman, you know which one?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, General David Stottomeyer. What about him?\u0026rdquo; Bart prompted.\n\u0026ldquo;He didn\u0026rsquo;t sound like he was gonna let any cute, little mermaid on some ain\u0026rsquo;t-no-body-knows-where-it-is-atoll tell him what he can and he can\u0026rsquo;t do,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;He was Mr. Unhappy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, I have a feeling he was behind the raid on Taylor\u0026rsquo;s Island,\u0026rdquo; Bart agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Whatcho gonna do?\u0026rdquo; Lucia asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, yet,\u0026rdquo; Bart admitted. \u0026ldquo;What are you going to do?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Damn, always so proper, correcting my grammar and shit,\u0026rdquo; Lucia teased, an old game between them. \u0026ldquo;I do not know what I will do myself, either, Mr. Kolbert, sir.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How would you like to take a trip to Mermaid Island?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;What?! Are you shitting me?\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed.\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, I\u0026rsquo;m serious,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t go be no mermaid,\u0026rdquo; she protested. \u0026ldquo;I got things to do, family and shit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not suggesting you go and become a mermaid, not unless you want to,\u0026rdquo; he said, calming her. \u0026ldquo;I was thinking it would be a good time for you to take a vacation. Get away from the cold city, go someplace warm. It could get dicey around here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which is exactly why I\u0026rsquo;m not going a n y w h e r e!\u0026rdquo; she said, rising out of her chair. \u0026ldquo;Someone has got to be here to bail your ass out of jail and shit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Your confidence in my professional judgement and your compassion for my well-being overwhelm me,\u0026rdquo; Bart said.\n\u0026ldquo;Shit,\u0026rdquo; Lucia said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s why you pay me the big bucks. Look, it\u0026rsquo;s quittin time. How about we go grab a drink or something?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now, that\u0026rsquo;s why I pay you the big bucks,\u0026rdquo; Bart said, rising. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll buy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Damn right,\u0026rdquo; said Lucia walking out of the office.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend we take any longer than we have to,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;But we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do anything until those headbands arrive. When did Pat say they\u0026rsquo;d arrive.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hopefully, later today,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;So, a three?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A three,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;They didn\u0026rsquo;t shoot us, we\u0026rsquo;re still alive, and I don\u0026rsquo;t hear the sound of helicopters outside. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That bad?\u0026rdquo; Kyle asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No one wanted anything,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. He saw the look of confusion on most everyone\u0026rsquo;s faces. \u0026ldquo;We want to be left alone. We offered them cures to things that none of those people want, except for the three scientists, and they don\u0026rsquo;t count for crap when it comes to final decisions. We didn\u0026rsquo;t offer the politicians money, the generals weapons, or the scientists knowledge. We offered them toys, basically.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This is why I despise politicians and generals!\u0026rdquo; Angela said. \u0026ldquo;Present company excepted, no offense.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;None taken,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;Besides, I was an admiral.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why didn\u0026rsquo;t they listen to you, then?\u0026rdquo; Angela asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Because I took off the uniform,\u0026rdquo; Mac said.\n\u0026ldquo;Susan told you not to take it off,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\n\u0026ldquo;He didn\u0026rsquo;t mean that literally,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Yes, he took off his jacket during the conference, but what he means is that he retired and he grew his hair long, which is, again, more important metaphorically than literally. He switched teams, and they didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like they had to listen to him.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, I get that,\u0026rdquo; Angela said. \u0026ldquo;You gave up all your power and influence and so you lost your voice. Ironic, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How is that ironic?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You become a merman and you lose your voice,\u0026rdquo; Angela said.\n\u0026ldquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t get it,\u0026rdquo; Mac said.\n\u0026ldquo;OMG, like \u0026hellip; The Little Mermaid?\u0026rdquo; Belle said. \u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t you ever watch Disney?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ohhhh, right. No, I missed all those cartoons,\u0026rdquo; Mac admitted. \u0026ldquo;Wished I hadn\u0026rsquo;t. I might have been a better father to Sally.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;None of that,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;d been a better father, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be mers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, here\u0026rsquo;s to sucky fathers making us mermaids!\u0026rdquo; Angela said.\nMac scowled at her.\n\u0026ldquo;Present company excepted, sorry,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Fuuuuuuck, man. Lighten up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well now, at least we can return to science for the rest of the day,\u0026rdquo; said Phoebe trying to brighten the mood. \u0026ldquo;Eric and Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pod are on their way, and we can stick some more probes into Eric and see what happens.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think in a past life, you were German,\u0026rdquo; Galina said.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t insult the Germans. They\u0026rsquo;re good people,\u0026rdquo; Pat teased. \u0026ldquo;Phoebe\u0026rsquo;s far worse than that. I bet she was the only girl in her school who pulled wings off of flies or legs off of ants.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Lexi and Valerie Dawson,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha, they were your cousins,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Eureka!!\u0026rdquo; shouted Rose as she surfaced in the lab pool. She held up a handful of tiny metal medallions, each about the size of a small coin.\n\u0026ldquo;What? What\u0026rsquo;s the hubbub?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Hubbub? Did you just say Hubbub?\u0026rdquo; Phoebe teased.\nThe rest of Trevor\u0026rsquo;s pod surfaced next to Rose as Eric, Sally, Liga, and Mari surfaced too.\n\u0026ldquo;Eric is a genius!\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;He figured out something amazing about our mer senses and our headbands.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, what is it?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\nRose kicked herself up into the lab and waited a second for the water to fall off her. She salamandered over to Pat and carefully poured over dozens of the small medallions onto the table. Pat picked one up and looked at it closely. It was made out of the same material as their headbands, intricately woven strands of polymerized sea metals that sparkled and flashed with countless colors. The woven strands in the tiny circle depicted the same \u0026ldquo;folded blanket\u0026rdquo; ornament that graced their headbands.\n\u0026ldquo;One side feels incredibly smooth while the other feels funny, almost fuzzy in a way,\u0026rdquo; Pat observed as she rubbed the medallion between two fingers.\n\u0026ldquo;Let her guess,\u0026rdquo; Rose admonished as Eric prepared to explain.\nPat shuffled over to a microscope and placed the charm sized circle onto a glass and slid it under the lens. Her long, auburn hair fell forward over her face as she lowered her face to the eyepieces. She carefully nudged the glass back and forth, brought it back out, flipped the charm over, and then repeated her careful examination. She straightened up and looked at Rose.\nRose smiled as she watched Pat scrutinize her face, ears, neck, and hands.\n\u0026ldquo;Turn around,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\nRose rolled her tail over, allowing her torso to spin around so she was sitting on the floor like a normal human. Pat bent over and examined her dorsal ridge in the area even with the top of Rose\u0026rsquo;s hips. There she could see two medallions sticking to the sides of her ridge, just below her scale line. Pat moved Rose\u0026rsquo;s black fringes to the side, bent over, getting a good look at the medallions. She gently pressed a fingernail along the side of one medallion, testing its adhesion. It was not going to be dislodged easily. She straightened back up.\n\u0026ldquo;Well? What do you think?\u0026rdquo; Eric asked, grinning like a little boy.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, we\u0026rsquo;ve got five bucks riding on this one,\u0026rdquo; Sally said.\n\u0026ldquo;You do, eh?\u0026rdquo; Pat said, warming to the contest. \u0026ldquo;Alright. These little gems probably enhance our mer senses in some way, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to bet it means that they\u0026rsquo;re sharper, clearer, and stronger. The fuzzy side acts like velcro, sticking to our nanostructured skin cells, and the positioning of each medallion correlates to where Eric can see our connections leaving and entering our bodies.\u0026rdquo;\nEric gaped at Pat, his eyes as wide as saucers. \u0026ldquo;Holy cow.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Bingo,\u0026rdquo; Rose said.\n\u0026ldquo;So, smarty pants, get your tail up here and let\u0026rsquo;s find out how you were able to do that,\u0026rdquo; Pat said, patting the surface of the table before her.\n\u0026ldquo;I want to know how you just did that! I mean, you got it perfect,\u0026rdquo; Eric said.\n\u0026ldquo;Perfectly,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. Phoebe rolled her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Girl power,\u0026rdquo; Sally said. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s how she does it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You explained how you could see our connections, and how when we were in formation, communicating long distance, energy seemed to leave each mer from their headband and flow into our backs,\u0026rdquo; Pat explained. \u0026ldquo;It wasn\u0026rsquo;t hard to figure out from those clues.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He said butt,\u0026rdquo; Sally joked. \u0026ldquo;He has a thing for butts.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, who\u0026rsquo;s idea was it to put contact lenses on our mer senses at the location of our mer organs?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It was his,\u0026rdquo; Sally admitted. \u0026ldquo;And, now we can all make the headbands and medallions! All of us!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked, astonished.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;After everyone was wearing the medallions, they could see how I was folding the energy at the tip of my knife. They could even see the CHEW blanket pattern in 3-D, which I hadn\u0026rsquo;t realized I was doing when I explained to to others.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, our bonds with Rose helped us do it, but we couldn\u0026rsquo;t explain what we were doing,\u0026rdquo; Trevor said. \u0026ldquo;Now, it\u0026rsquo;s like putting a telescope on your eyes. We can sense things that are miles and miles away.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And stuff that\u0026rsquo;s close, is like, so beautiful, clear, and like, amazing,\u0026rdquo; Cleo said.\n\u0026ldquo;And, we can sort of see the connections, just like Eric!\u0026rdquo; Rikki said.\n\u0026ldquo;You can see CHEW?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, he really sees the connections, and the color and everything,\u0026rdquo; Rikki explained. \u0026ldquo;We only see the electrical looking thread that snakes between us. It just looks yellow, not all the other colors that Eric can see.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is OUTSTANDING,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes! And we can talk without the formation\u0026ndash;miles and miles!\u0026rdquo; Trevor said.\n\u0026ldquo;Miles and miles?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked. \u0026ldquo;How do you know? Have you tested it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Put your contact lenses on, and get into the pool,\u0026rdquo; advised Rose pushing two charms towards her.\n\u0026ldquo;How do I know where to put them?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Just reach around and follow your instincts,\u0026rdquo; Rose said. \u0026ldquo;We can do our own, but only Eric can do someone else. He\u0026rsquo;s the only one who can clearly see the actual CHEW as it leaves the body.\u0026rdquo;\nPat picked up a charm and reached around behind her back. She ran the charm along the edge of her ridge and suddenly felt a tingle along her back. She moved the charm back and forth until she was sure she had the spot where the tingle was the strongest and pressed the fuzzy side to her body. It felt good, she realized, like pressing a warm compress over a sore muscle. She repeated the operation on the other side.\n\u0026ldquo;O.K., that was easy,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Now what?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Go into the pool and wait a second,\u0026rdquo; said Rose as she shuffled towards the water.\nWhile Pat headed for the pool, Phoebe, Galina, and Alexis all put on their medallions. Soon everyone was back in the pool, which wasn\u0026rsquo;t a particularly large one, and so it was a bit crowded.\n[Ready?] Rose asked.\n[Ready,] Pat answered.\n[Trixi, you there?] Rose said. A few seconds later, Trixi answered.\n[Can you hear me now?] she asked.\n[Yes, perfectly,] Rose answered. [Can everyone else?]\nAll the adults nodded.\n[Trixi, where are you?] Pat asked.\n[Hi Pat! We\u0026rsquo;ve been swimming at top speed for over two hours,] Trixi answered. [Mark thinks we are about seventy-five miles out.]\n[That\u0026rsquo;s about one hundred and twenty kilometers, and you\u0026rsquo;re reaching us in the lab pool, with no direct line of sight!] said Pat. [This is more than amazing, it\u0026rsquo;s a miracle.]\n[We have a long list of miracles to account for,] joked John as he released Maureen so she could swim to her mother.\n[I suppose so,] Pat agreed. [We could start with the little miracle right here,] she said, gathering her daughter into her arms.\n[Who are you talking to?] Trixi asked.\n[John,] Pat answered. [Couldn\u0026rsquo;t you hear him?]\n[No,] Trixi answered. [It seems like we have to picture the person before we can hear them.]\n[I\u0026rsquo;ll bet that an unconscious trigger would do it,] Pat said. [We all heard you just fine after Rose dialed you in. None of us actively pictured you.]\n[Yea, that makes sense,] Trixi said. [I can sort of sense more mers there with you now that I realize that you and Rose aren\u0026rsquo;t alone.]\n[Right, either a conscious or unconscious trigger probably does it,] said Pat thinking aloud. [I\u0026rsquo;ll bet we can\u0026rsquo;t do this with a stranger. We would have no memory of their CHEW to focus on, no way to dial them in. Are you still swimming? I can sort of sense you doing that.]\n[Yea, we plan to keep going for another twelve hours,] Trixi reported. [All you have to do is picture one of us in your head and that seems to focus the CHEW in our direction.]\n[We need to get these to the mers in Maryland right away,] Galina said. [If we can communicate across the oceans, we might just survive the next few months.]\n[Or years,] Alexis said.\n[Why is it all you guys think we\u0026rsquo;re in trouble?] Phoebe asked. [I still don\u0026rsquo;t understand. I thought they liked us.]\n[The generals never smiled,] Galina said. [They want our knowledge and power but they fear our Device.]\n[It\u0026rsquo;s a good idea, Galina, though we don\u0026rsquo;t have any memory of their patterns. It\u0026rsquo;s worth a try to send them a few of these medallions,] Pat agreed.\n[I\u0026rsquo;ll bet Sally can dial her father in, even though she doesn\u0026rsquo;t know Mac the merman\u0026rsquo;s signal,] Eric said.\n[Let\u0026rsquo;s hope so,] Pat agreed. [We\u0026rsquo;ll give it a whirl in any event. Better safe than sorry. Let\u0026rsquo;s get back into the lab, and get that going. And let\u0026rsquo;s get you up onto a table and under some instruments.]\n[Damn,] Eric said. [Me and my big mouth. I hate your instruments.]\n[They are also my instruments,] said Alexis pushing her breasts into his arm. [If you\u0026rsquo;re a good boy and let us test you again, I\u0026rsquo;ll make you feel all better after it\u0026rsquo;s over.]\nA much younger looking Jackson Baker carried the FedEx box into the main viewing room. Everyone else was looking and feeling younger too, and they clustered around as he opened the box and lifted out the twentyfour beautiful headbands.\n\u0026ldquo;Everybody gets one,\u0026rdquo; said Jack as he spread them out on the floor.\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re not all the same,\u0026rdquo; Amanda noticed.\n\u0026ldquo;They come in boys and girls sizes,\u0026rdquo; said Joy from her perch in the tank. \u0026ldquo;You should be able to tell the difference.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, there are six for boys and eighteen for girls,\u0026rdquo; Annie said, lifting one to her own head. \u0026ldquo;These are beautiful.\u0026rdquo;\nJack grabbed four and walked over to the tank. He tossed them, one at a time, up to Joy. She caught each one and handed them down to her pod mates as they swam by. A gasp rose up from the crowd as Bonnie snapped into view, adjusting her headband as she swam. Joy looked down and watched as both Annette and Mac snapped into view as they put on their headbands. She let go of the tank wall and sank, reappearing herself a few seconds later as she put her headband on.\nThe four mers looked at each other, gesturing like they were talking, but their mouths weren\u0026rsquo;t moving. The humans all put on a headband and then watched the silent conversation in the tank.\n[We\u0026rsquo;re talking with CHEW,] Joy explained. [Finally!]\n[Why is your hair blond?] Bonnie asked her former wife.\n[My hair is blond?] Annette shrieked. [Oh, my! My hair IS blond,] she gushed as she pulled a strand in front of her face.\n[What\u0026rsquo;s going on?] Mac asked. [Why has our camouflage turned off?]\nJoy swam closer to Mac and gave his face, neck, and chest a close examination.\n[It\u0026rsquo;s not off,] she said. [It\u0026rsquo;s just getting more than one signal. The headbands strengthen and focus our CHEW, and our CHEW must affect our chromatophores. Maybe we can control how we look, finally.]\n[Now, that would be outstanding! Let me try something,] Mac said.\nHe closed his eyes and concentrated. As both his pod-mates and the humans watched, his body slowly changed appearance. Like the slow creep of color across a chameleon\u0026rsquo;s back, Mac\u0026rsquo;s tail turned a magnificent dark blue and his torso returned to his former beige color. He opened his eyes, and they were blue again. He blinked, and suddenly he was gone, his camouflage back on at full strength. Then, the blue tail slowly returned, creeping up his body inch by inch.\nThe rest of the mers all closed their eyes, and slowly the colorings they had dreamed of began to appear.\nJoy\u0026rsquo;s tail turned blue, and her fringes turned white, her brown eyes sparkled with flecks of gold and yellow and her hair was a lustrous mix of browns. Annette\u0026rsquo;s hair turned a brilliant, golden blond, and her eyes were green again, but this time with the mermaid sparkle that made them spectacular, and her tail turned a rich red color with white highlights and white fringes. Bonnie\u0026rsquo;s tail also turned red but she had green highlights and fringes, and her eyes were blue and her hair was a classic, Celtic red. All of the mers looked, more or less, just like the ones on Mermaid Island.\n[This is amazing,] Mac said. [The picture in my mind was so easy to keep, and it\u0026rsquo;s getting easier to turn it on and off.]\nHe demonstrated by flashing between camo and color modes, back and forth. The other mers also experimented with switching between their camo and color configurations, their speeds increasing as they got the hang of the mental focus needed to make the switch. After a few minutes of experimenting, everyone returned to their new color schemes.\n[It\u0026rsquo;s almost as if this is our new neutral,] said Joy indicating her blue tail.\n[Let\u0026rsquo;s test it,] Annette said. [Let\u0026rsquo;s exit as colored mers and see if it holds.]\nThe mers all nodded and rose to the surface of the tank. They held their new colors when their faces and hands broke the surface of the water. Mac smirked at Joy and she shouted, \u0026ldquo;Make a hole,\u0026rdquo; and everyone scrambled. Mac ducked down, not disappearing this time, and flipped himself out of the tank, somersaulting onto the floor as usual, water splashing everywhere. His new coloring remained.\n\u0026ldquo;It works!\u0026rdquo; Mac said, admiring his deep, blue tail.\nHis three mermaids followed, and everyone admired their beautiful coloring. The mermaids squeezed the water from their hair and began running their fingers through the long tresses. Angela walked over to Bonnie admiring her tail and new hair.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to be a redhead,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Would that be alright with you?\u0026rdquo; she asked, turning back to Jack.\n\u0026ldquo;You can be anything you want, my dear. As long as you don\u0026rsquo;t mind me being so old school,\u0026rdquo; he answered.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re growing on me, old man,\u0026rdquo; Angela teased. \u0026ldquo;Maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll be good for each other, eh?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s hope so,\u0026rdquo; Jack said, smiling.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we\u0026rsquo;re not hydrophobic,\u0026rdquo; Mac observed, \u0026ldquo;But that\u0026rsquo;s a small price to pay for our camouflage.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But our skin and hair are drying much faster than normal, human hair,\u0026rdquo; Annette said, running her hands through her thick, golden hair. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s only been a few minutes and my hair is nearly dry. When I was a kid and had hair this long, it would take almost an hour for it to air dry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s good! Maybe we still have some hydrodynamic advantages even if our skin isn\u0026rsquo;t completely hydrophobic,\u0026rdquo; said Joy fluffing out her own hair.\n\u0026ldquo;I hope so! I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to get out into open water and see how fast we can go,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll have to suffer no end of teasing from Mark if I can\u0026rsquo;t keep up with him.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You can always sneak up on him,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said.\n\u0026ldquo;His mer senses work just as good as ours,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;Our camouflage can never protect us from another mer, only from sighted predators.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Makes us good spies, at least, on humans,\u0026rdquo; Annette said.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s hope it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come to that,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;Though, after this morning\u0026rsquo;s phone call, I\u0026rsquo;m not very confident.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can you control your camouflage out of the water now?\u0026rdquo; Jack asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Mac said.\nHe looked over his body, concentrating. He closed his eyes and furrowed his brow, and his skin flickered, a flash of silver running across his body. He opened his eyes and looked around the room, seeking a spot on the wall with a relatively solid surface and nothing mounted on it. He salamandered over to the blank spot and sat down with his back against the wall and his tail stretched out before him. He looked down at his tail and concentrated, his skin flickered once, and then he snapped out of view.\n\u0026ldquo;Cool,\u0026rdquo; Mac\u0026rsquo;s voice emerged from the apparently empty space. \u0026ldquo;Can you see me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just barely, but that\u0026rsquo;s because I know you\u0026rsquo;re there,\u0026rdquo; Jack answered.\n\u0026ldquo;We can see you fine,\u0026rdquo; said Joy looking at her pod mates. \u0026ldquo;But we are bonded to you, after all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not too hard to do once you find the switch,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s hard to explain, but it feels like a blanket I\u0026rsquo;m pulling up over my body.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Does it take a lot of energy?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, it does,\u0026rdquo; Mac admitted. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a lot easier in the water.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s automatic in the water,\u0026rdquo; Annette said.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t waste any more energy doing that,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I can sense how much effort that takes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; said Mac his camo snapping off. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve got other issues at the moment, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right, and we best get on with it,\u0026rdquo; Jack said, looking over the three people who were forming his pod. \u0026ldquo;If all heck is going to break loose, I\u0026rsquo;d love to be able to swim away.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;O.K. folks, line up. Sasha, you\u0026rsquo;re with Mac, the rest of you are with us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;At least this time you\u0026rsquo;ll keep your eyes open,\u0026rdquo; Sasha teased as she walked towards him.\nMac looked over the ex-schoolteacher as she knelt before him. Sasha\u0026rsquo;s Nordic and Eastern European heritage was visible in her blond hair, her sharp features, and her height. As the first feedings had youthened everyone, the view was considerably better than it was yesterday. He had no problems tugging on his vent muscle and allowing her to get started on her second feeding.\nCassie shared Bonnie with Jack. Cassie hoped Bonnie\u0026rsquo;s mermaid milk was stronger than Mac\u0026rsquo;s semen. Her long simmering attraction to Jack was now a bonfire of passion, but she still looked like a man. Granted, she now looked like a slightly younger man, but Jack\u0026rsquo;s eyes still showed his revulsion. How she craved the return of the love she had felt for him since they were in college! She avoided his gaze as they each positioned themselves on either side of Bonnie.\nCassie cradled Bonnie\u0026rsquo;s large breast in her hands, wondering how Jack\u0026rsquo;s nearness might influence how she turned out. She could feel Jack\u0026rsquo;s head next to her own as he drank from their shared mermaid. As she started to suckle, she remembered back to her college days, to the night she got drunk and confessed \u0026ldquo;his\u0026rdquo; love for Jack. In the days following her admission, she feared that Jack would humiliate and expose him. Carl\u0026rsquo;s crush on the tall, gangly Jack blossomed into respect and admiration because Jack never teased him and remained a friend throughout his whole life. If becoming a woman was the price of finally winning Jack\u0026rsquo;s love, then Cassie was going to accept that bargain.\nAfter about ten minutes, everyone had finished their feeding and Mac urged everyone up into the tank.\n\u0026ldquo;We were infected by those microorganisms, not mermaid milk,\u0026rdquo; he explained. \u0026ldquo;So, those little buggers are alive and well in that tank. It should help speed up the Type II transformations.\u0026rdquo;\nEveryone turned to look at Jack, knowing he might have something to say about everyone clambering into his precious tank. Jack felt everyone\u0026rsquo;s gaze, and looked at the several cuttlefish he could see. One of his prized molluscs had already died, but the prospect of putting to rest the torment in his heart was stronger. He looked back at Cassie, wishing she looked less like Carl and more like a woman. He knew she pinned for him, but he could not bring himself to comfort her.\nJack looked at Angela and Belle. They both smiled warmly, and Jack\u0026rsquo;s heart thumped in his chest. Both had always been attractive, if very angry, young women, and Jack had often wished he could take away the pain their insestuous fathers had inflicted upon them. Both were now looking fresh, young, and without tattoos or other body markings. Both had discarded the various piercings that had marked their bodies as well. As he watched, Angela reached out for Cassie\u0026rsquo;s hand and gave it a squeeze.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s all get into the tank.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Great,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Grab some floats so that everyone can be comfortable in the center of the tank. Each of you should focus on your own pods, and we\u0026rsquo;ll surround all of you and see if our mer organs can\u0026rsquo;t add a bit of push to things. If we\u0026rsquo;re lucky, we can speed everyone through the second stage of transformation, and then we\u0026rsquo;ll have enough mermaid milk producers to begin the final changes later tonight.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The sooner the better,\u0026rdquo; Mac agreed. \u0026ldquo;And you should all be naked, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking.\u0026rdquo;\nEveryone blinked for a moment as they realized what they were about to do. Annie stood up and began taking off her clothes. She was nearly six feet tall and while she still looked like a middle-aged woman, she was a very beautiful and handsome middle-aged woman. Everyone followed her lead, and soon they were all naked.\nKyle brought out an armful of life vests and shared them with the eight humans. As they all started for the tank, Jack\u0026rsquo;s computer beeped. Kyle and his pod climbed into the tank as Jack walked over to the computer and checked his email. After reading the message, he straightened up.\n\u0026ldquo;Susan will be here tomorrow morning,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;And I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s good.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What did she say?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s in code, mostly,\u0026rdquo; Jack answered. \u0026ldquo;But she\u0026rsquo;ll come with her pod and she has troublesome news to share.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s deal with it tomorrow,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;All the more reason to get into the tank now.\u0026rdquo;\nJack nodded and turned to help Angela up the ladder. She hesitated a moment, torn between her habit of fierce independence and the affection she felt building for her old family friend. She smiled, and held out her hand like she was a grand lady.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you, my darling,\u0026rdquo; Angela said with a terrible British accent. \u0026ldquo;How lovely of you to assist.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll miss the angry little girl with fire in her eyes,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, don\u0026rsquo;t you worry,\u0026rdquo; she said in her normal voice. \u0026ldquo;That little girl will never leave you. The fire is still there, it\u0026rsquo;s just got a different reason to burn,\u0026rdquo; she finished with a passionate kiss on Jack\u0026rsquo;s lips.\nHe blinked, shocked, recovered, and helped her up the stairs, admiring her long, lean lines as she clambered up and into the tank. He helped Belle next, and she kissed him too. Finally Cassie stepped up to the bottom of the ladder. Jack could see the fear of rejection in her eyes, and he was determined to wipe it from her face. Jack looked past the still male face, thinking about the woman yet to be, and saw the sparkle of love in her blue eyes. He grabbed her hand and brought her into a kiss, feeling a touch of whisker brush against his chin as he kissed her.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you,\u0026rdquo; Cassie said softly.\n\u0026ldquo;Should have done that years ago,\u0026rdquo; Jack said, and together they climbed up into the tank.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe we didn\u0026rsquo;t think of this before!\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t guess everything on the first go,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;Besides, that\u0026rsquo;s why they call it science.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Look who is giving the lesson now,\u0026rdquo; Pat teased.\n\u0026ldquo;What is synesthesia?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked. \u0026ldquo;Is it rare? Will it hurt him?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He will have no ill effects from such a thing,\u0026rdquo; Galina said. \u0026ldquo;In fact, it is likely that such a thing will help him and his children.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If it\u0026rsquo;s genetic,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Last I heard the jury was still out.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Da,\u0026rdquo; Galina agreed. \u0026ldquo;If it is genetic.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, our children might be affected?\u0026rdquo; Sally asked.\n\u0026ldquo;We can\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Pat admitted. \u0026ldquo;But it\u0026rsquo;s not something you should worry about.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; Eric said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine, and I\u0026rsquo;m right here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know that,\u0026rdquo; Sally said. \u0026ldquo;But I just don\u0026rsquo;t understand it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s sort of like reverse color blindness,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe said. \u0026ldquo;Instead of losing a sense, you gain one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s actually not an uncommon phenomena,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Synesthesia appears in about five percent of the population, so it was about time we had one. In this case, Eric\u0026rsquo;s mer senses have fused with his sense of color, giving visual definition and spatial clarity to a non-visual and non-spatial stimulation.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did you have such a thing before you were a mer?\u0026rdquo; Galina asked.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; asked Eric.\n\u0026ldquo;Did colors have smells or did numbers or letters have some other quality, like color, personality or a position in three dimensional space?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Not that I can remember,\u0026rdquo; Eric said.\n\u0026ldquo;It is probable product of the transition,\u0026rdquo; Galina said.\n\u0026ldquo;Probably,\u0026rdquo; Pat agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;As long as he\u0026rsquo;s alright,\u0026rdquo; said Sally helping Eric down from the table.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m perfectly fine,\u0026rdquo; Eric said.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, get started on those medallions,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;The seaplane will be here in two hours.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone should come out to the uprise,\u0026rdquo; Eric said. \u0026ldquo;That way everyone can learn how to polymerize!\u0026rdquo;\nMalaki watched as the mers headed into the surf, among them, his former son. He had successfully worked free one of his bindings, and with patience he would soon be able to \u0026ldquo;fake\u0026rdquo; his bindings so as to fool the humans who remained on the beach. He wished that he could take action against Harold\u0026rsquo;s pod, killing his former son, but he was unlikely to have that chance, and he knew that the mers were stronger and quicker than humans. No, if he was to inflict any kind of revenge, it would have to be upon the two human pods, who had yet to finish their transformations into those hated creatures.\nPerhaps he could act this evening, as they all slept. What a sweet revenge that would be! To kill all eight remaining humans just as they were on the cusp of transformation. In his head, he laughed like a madman, but in his body, he continued to flex the ropes that still bound his wrists together.\nAfter an hour in the tank, Cassie felt the first twinges of pressure begin to build around her. An hour after that, the first bubbles began forming on her body. For the next hour or so, the bubbles appeared only in patches and only briefly. By the end of the third hour in the tank, the bubbles began to appear more regularly, and by the end of the fourth hour, she was the only one who still had bubbles appearing on her body.\nShe looked around the tank. She was the only one still using a float, all the others had completed the second stage of transformation. They had gills, webbing, and youthful, healthy, beautiful bodies. She could see her body appearing younger, caught in a state of androgyny. She clearly had a long way to go.\nShe had help, however, and that was a comfort to her floating alone, on the surface. Kyle\u0026rsquo;s pod had dispersed themselves among Mac\u0026rsquo;s pod, all of them focusing on her change. Jack and the rest of her pod stayed close to her, and she could feel their hands on her body as she struggled to keep the change going.\nShe took the life vest off her neck, took a deep breath, and then let herself sink below the surface. She waited for the bubbles to appear, welcoming them as they did. They were getting thicker and more vigorous. She felt her breath grow stale and she pulled herself up again. She repeated that pattern for another twenty minutes, the bubbles slowly growing stronger and stronger.\nA stab of pain jerked her hips, and she welcomed the clear sign of her body speeding up its journey. Another twenty minutes later, pressure grew along her limbs and head as her body slowly, painfully reshaped itself. Her stomach rumbled after four hours in the tank, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to stop the process. The bubbles now blanketed her body, the changes happening in minutes, rather than hours.\nHer abdomen burned as her internal organs changed and moved, and her face seemed swollen and numb. Fingers and feet ached, elbows and shoulders throbbed, hips stretched, and her skull pressed into her brain. After six hours, the pressure finally eased, and the bubbles slowly faded. She realized that she had spent the last thirty minutes completely underwater, and she smiled at her pod as they embraced her.\n\u0026ldquo;Just sign here,\u0026rdquo; the young pilot indicated a line on his clipboard. Michael signed with a flourish, smiling as he watched the young man try to keep from gaping at his girls.\n\u0026ldquo;You gonna be here long?\u0026rdquo; The young man asked, his khaki pants tenting across his stiffening penis seeing Lucy and Pearl splash each other in the shallow surf near his seaplane.\n\u0026ldquo;There will be someone here, but we might get rotated back to the states any time,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\n\u0026ldquo;You all are scientists?\u0026rdquo; the pilot said. \u0026ldquo;You all don\u0026rsquo;t look like scientists.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What makes you think we\u0026rsquo;re not scientists?\u0026rdquo; Martin asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you all look young,\u0026rdquo; the equally young man said.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not all young,\u0026rdquo; Conjo said as Martin helped him down off the float and into the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, no offense,\u0026rdquo; the pilot said. \u0026ldquo;But you don\u0026rsquo;t look like a scientist either, and I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen girls that pretty who are science types,\u0026rdquo; he finished, his gaze roving across the six women scattered across the beach and in the surf.\n\u0026ldquo;Just goes to show, you can\u0026rsquo;t judge a book by its cover,\u0026rdquo; Martin said with a touch of hardness in his voice.\nThe young pilot looked at the the chiseled, tanned, and steely-eyed man who had one foot on the float to the plane. He seemed to be in his midtwenties, about six feet tall (183 cm), and in really good shape. Both men had longer than average hair, and all six women were stunningly beautiful. All eight young people had some sort of tattoo on their backs, sort of like angel wings. The old man he had just ferried to the island looked like a common laborer, but his English was surprisingly good. The pilot decided to let it drop.\n\u0026ldquo;This should get there in about two or three days,\u0026rdquo; the pilot said, taking the small box from Martin. \u0026ldquo;Overnight simply isn\u0026rsquo;t possible from this location.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The sooner the better,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\n\u0026ldquo;The contents are inert, non-biological, right?\u0026rdquo; the pilot asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The contents are inert, yes,\u0026rdquo; Michael said. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re hoping that the labs back in Maryland can tell us more about what other properties these metallic objects might have. We trust that these will arrive safely.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;These are what is in the box,\u0026rdquo; Martin said, unfurling his fist.\nThe pilot looked over at the eight, small metallic disks in Martin\u0026rsquo;s palm. They didn\u0026rsquo;t look particularly valuable, though they were pretty in their own way. They looked like expensive screens that might be used as a filter. The pilot lifted an eyebrow at Martin in a question, and Martin picked up a disk and offered it to the pilot.\n\u0026ldquo;Where did you find these?\u0026rdquo; the pilot asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You have a lot of questions for a FedEx pilot,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m an independent contractor. The FedEx people are in Suva,\u0026rdquo; the young man said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just curious, that\u0026rsquo;s all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We didn\u0026rsquo;t find them,\u0026rdquo; Martin said. \u0026ldquo;We made them. They are lighter and stronger than normal metallic screens and we think we might get rich on the process if they are as tough and strong as we think they are.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, well good luck to you, then,\u0026rdquo; the pilot said, understanding now why the beautiful women might be attached to men who might become rich. \u0026ldquo;I hope we can do a lot of business in the future.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We hope so too,\u0026rdquo; said Michael handing back the clipboard.\nThe pilot tucked the box and the clipboard under his arm and climbed back up into his seaplane. Michael and Martin pushed the seaplane back out into the lagoon and then turned it towards the open sea. The pilot started his engines, taxied out of the lagoon, roared off into the sky.\n\u0026ldquo;Did he seem overly curious to you?\u0026rdquo; Martin asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yea, but I think it was mostly because the girls were so beautiful,\u0026rdquo; Michael said, turning back towards the beach where the six women had gathered. \u0026ldquo;He probably hoped that he could snag one for himself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I suppose a stranger wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recognize bonded pods,\u0026rdquo; Martin agreed.\n\u0026ldquo;Pods?\u0026rdquo; Conjo asked as he followed the two young men up onto the beach.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a long story, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure that we\u0026rsquo;ll eventually fill in all the details,\u0026rdquo; Michael said.\n\u0026ldquo;How did you find us?\u0026rdquo; Martin asked.\n\u0026ldquo;When I last spoke with Joy, she gave me Mr. Kolbert\u0026rsquo;s information. He was kind enough to arrange passage from Davao to Suva, and I was only there a day when this opportunity arose,\u0026rdquo; he explained.\nMichael could see that Conjo was feeling self-conscious around so many beautiful women. He thought to make some sort of introduction or icebreaker when Vidya squealed in recognition.\n\u0026ldquo;Joe!\u0026rdquo; she screamed, rushing towards the three men as they waded through the surf. \u0026ldquo;I knew that you were one of them!\u0026rdquo;\nShe threw her arms around the old man, startling and embarrassing him, as she kissed him on both cheeks.\n\u0026ldquo;Joe was the one who bought me but didn\u0026rsquo;t use me,\u0026rdquo; Vidya said to her sisters. \u0026ldquo;Remember?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, so you were part of the rescue!\u0026rdquo; Rani said, coming forward and giving Conjo a welcome.\n\u0026ldquo;I was only sorry I did not arrive in time to save your sister,\u0026rdquo; Conjo said. \u0026ldquo;She was \u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo;\nHe stared at Geeta, confused.\n\u0026ldquo;But \u0026hellip; I buried you!\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed, thinking he was seeing a ghost.\n\u0026ldquo;You did,\u0026rdquo; Geeta said. \u0026ldquo;I was her brother, and now I have taken her place.\u0026rdquo;\nConjo\u0026rsquo;s jaw worked silently, his mind struggling with the miraculous paradox before him. After a second, Vidya and Rani guided him to the sand where he sat down with a thump.\n\u0026ldquo;It is not only a long story; it is also a very good one,\u0026rdquo; said Geeta as she walked towards her sisters and the old man, who was clearly shaken.\n\u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t we go round up some dinner while you guys fill him in?\u0026rdquo; Liz suggested, pulling off her bikini top and wiggling out of her bottoms. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll be back in an hour or so?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a wonderful idea,\u0026rdquo; Geeta said, smiling at the glint she saw in Liz\u0026rsquo;s eyes. She and her sister-wives had spent some time ravaging Martin while gathering lunch earlier.\n\u0026ldquo;Every time I get an excuse to wear this wonderful bikini, you find a way to get me out of it,\u0026rdquo; complained Pearl as she dropped her top and bottoms too.\n\u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t take much to get you out of clothes,\u0026rdquo; said Lucy, rubbing her breasts as they fell free from the bikini top.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s see how long Michael can hold his breath,\u0026rdquo; Liz said, walking into the lagoon.\n\u0026ldquo;It may take more than an hour to get dinner,\u0026rdquo; said Michael grinning.\n\u0026ldquo;It will probably take more than an hour to explain everything to Conjo,\u0026rdquo; Martin said.\n\u0026ldquo;Do that again!\u0026rdquo; Susan Perelli exclaimed.\nThe small, Italian dynamo clutched Miriam Dander\u0026rsquo;s hand, both of them standing before the glass wall of Jackson Baker\u0026rsquo;s tank. She gasped as Mac\u0026rsquo;s pod switched from camo to color to brown. Her jaw nearly dropped off her face when they flashed each other\u0026rsquo;s colors in rotation, alternating between red and blue tails and various highlights in an extravagant rotoscope of color and light.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s amazing,\u0026rdquo; Miriam said, a youthful light shining in her old, weary eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s enough,\u0026rdquo; said Susan, a visage of professionalism and power falling over her face like a mask. \u0026ldquo;All the more reason why we cannot waste another moment,\u0026rdquo; she finished, waving Mac\u0026rsquo;s pod up and out of the tank.\nOnce everyone one was assembled in the main viewing room, Susan looked over the mixture of humans and mers. She realized, much to her amazement, that she, Bill, and Miriam were the only ones wearing clothes. When Jack greeted her at the door to his house, he had been wearing a robe. He was also youthful and terribly handsome. After she had been shown the tank and the mers, she didn\u0026rsquo;t notice anyone else, but she realized that they had been naked since she had arrived. Jack must have discarded the robe before entering the tank viewing room. The mers were in their \u0026ldquo;colorful\u0026rdquo; state, and the humans were all clustered, like the mers, into pods of three females to one male. Everyone in the room, human and mer, were stunning specimens of beauty, power, and grace.\n\u0026ldquo;Admiral Bennett \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she began, trying to ignore everyone\u0026rsquo;s nakedness.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Mac, just Mac,\u0026rdquo; Mac said with a scowl.\n\u0026ldquo;Mac, yes, of course,\u0026rdquo; Susan said. \u0026ldquo;Well, sir, you were right. General David Stottomeyer authorized the raid on this island, and he appears to be arranging assets and personnel for a second try, but this time using Homeland Security.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not a military raid, then?\u0026rdquo; Mac asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Correct sir,\u0026rdquo; Susan said. \u0026ldquo;We have been tracking communications that seem to suggest that he has an ally in Justice, though we cannot be sure. It looks to be less a raid and more of an administrative takeover.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Justice?\u0026rdquo; Angela asked. \u0026ldquo;I thought these intra-agency black ops only happened in Hollywood movies.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry?\u0026rdquo; Susan asked, looking over at the redheaded beauty.\n\u0026ldquo;Angela, I\u0026rsquo;m with him,\u0026rdquo; she said, jerking a thumb at Jack.\n\u0026ldquo;Angela, nice to meet you,\u0026rdquo; Susan said.\n\u0026ldquo;Art often mirrors life,\u0026rdquo; Joy interrupted. \u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;re right, these types of efforts are the exception, not the rule. What\u0026rsquo;s the link between his raid and our polycom? He was cranked about Jack and this island before he knew about mermaids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t be sure,\u0026rdquo; said Susan looking back at the brunette mermaid with the long blue tail. \u0026ldquo;But here is where Miriam can help.\u0026rdquo;\nSusan turned to her old friend and offered her the floor. Miriam Danders glanced around the room, nervously eyeing both humans and mers. She seemed agitated, but Susan waited for her friend to speak.\n\u0026ldquo;I haven\u0026rsquo;t been authorized to give you any details, and frankly I don\u0026rsquo;t know any real details, which is one of the reasons why I got sent,\u0026rdquo; Miriam said. \u0026ldquo;As you know, my boss is the President\u0026rsquo;s Chief of Staff, and he\u0026rsquo;s inclined to work towards some sort of recognition of MMI and the work you could accomplish.\u0026rdquo;\nShe took a deep breath, looking at the mers again.\n\u0026ldquo;However, he is only one voice in the room, and some of the president\u0026rsquo;s advisors seem determined to secure the potential services of mers towards their exclusive ends. You probably surmised as much during our polycom,\u0026rdquo; she said to nods all around the room.\n\u0026ldquo;The President is in a delicate position,\u0026rdquo; she continued. \u0026ldquo;And while I don\u0026rsquo;t know anything officially, the problem is more political than legal. He believes that if you can lie low for a while, the political problem will resolve itself, and we can move forward.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Stottomeyer has some shit on the President, doesn\u0026rsquo;t he, and he\u0026rsquo;s trying to exploit it for power,\u0026rdquo; Mac said.\n\u0026ldquo;That I can neither confirm nor deny,\u0026rdquo; Miriam said nervously.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have to,\u0026rdquo; Mac said. \u0026ldquo;David is a weasley bastard who resents civilian oversight. Most of the Joint Command despise him, or at least they did a few months ago.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They still do,\u0026rdquo; Susan reported. \u0026ldquo;But he\u0026rsquo;s become powerful \u0026hellip; a problem.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And we\u0026rsquo;re being leveraged as the political bait?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Bait that the President hopes would actually escape and survive,\u0026rdquo; Miriam said.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re in agreement, then,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;I know you don\u0026rsquo;t know anything, but surely you might have imagined some things we ought to consider doing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you,\u0026rdquo; Miriam said, smiling for the first time. \u0026ldquo;You might consider giving an old woman from New Hampshire a new start, and she might form a trustworthy and secure link to the civilian leadership.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought we had already agreed that you guys were going to join us?\u0026rdquo; said Joy looking at Bill, Susan, and Miriam.\n\u0026ldquo;Under the circumstances, we thought a formal invitation might be more useful,\u0026rdquo; Miriam said. \u0026ldquo;And \u0026hellip; well, there is another issue.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s always another issue,\u0026rdquo; said Joy rolling her eyes. \u0026ldquo;What is it? Someone\u0026rsquo;s cousin?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good guess,\u0026rdquo; Susan said with a laugh. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Stottomeyer\u0026rsquo;s nephew.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;WHAT?\u0026rdquo; Joy exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;I thought he was the problem!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Lieutenant Commander James Roberts, currently assigned to Navy Intelligence, is the nephew of General David Stottomeyer,\u0026rdquo; Susan said.\n\u0026ldquo;He hates his uncle,\u0026rdquo; Miriam said. \u0026ldquo;He came to our office about a year ago and volunteered to help corral the general. We haven\u0026rsquo;t had a worthy opportunity to do so until now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the opportunity\u0026rdquo; Joy asked, looking at Bill, whom she saw wasn\u0026rsquo;t overly concerned with where the conversation was headed.\n\u0026ldquo;He would join our pod,\u0026rdquo; Susan explained.\n\u0026ldquo;O.K., what about Bill?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The Lieutenant Commander would become a mermaid,\u0026rdquo; Miriam said. \u0026ldquo;James is bi-sexual and is willing to experiment, but more importantly, the President believes that such a move would help ease the political issues we mentioned before.\n\u0026ldquo;And we don\u0026rsquo;t need to know why or how, I suppose,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;Do you need a formal invitation?\u0026rdquo;\nMiriam nodded. Joy looked at the rest of her pod and then Kyle and Jack\u0026rsquo;s pods. She turned back to Miriam.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re placing a lot of trust in you,\u0026rdquo; Joy said.\n\u0026ldquo;If Susan trusts her, I trust her,\u0026rdquo; Jack said.\n\u0026ldquo;Then consider this a formal invitation,\u0026rdquo; Joy said. \u0026ldquo;What does this do to our timetable?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He can be here in two days,\u0026rdquo; Miriam said.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t think assets will be in place for Stottomeyer to make his move for another five or six days,\u0026rdquo; Susan confirmed.\n\u0026ldquo;That gives us a two day cushion,\u0026rdquo; Joy said, doing the math in her head.\n\u0026ldquo;If the tank doesn\u0026rsquo;t increase its level of agency,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s been getting stronger and stronger with each change. We might be changed even sooner.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sooner is better,\u0026rdquo; Joy agreed. \u0026ldquo;We can hang out for a day or so if we have to, but we can\u0026rsquo;t speed up changes if we have to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How are you going to secure this facility if Homeland Security takes it over?\u0026rdquo; Susan asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll leave the sea gates open, and fish that leave, leave; and ones that don\u0026rsquo;t, won\u0026rsquo;t. Theoretically, the system can keep the tank clean for several years, but the batteries for the lights will wear out sooner. If the mers are still in trouble at that time, the tank will be the least of my worries.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But if we leave, they can come in through the sea gates and get into the pool,\u0026rdquo; Joy argued. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what started Mac and I on our journey. They could become mers on their own.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not so sure that\u0026rsquo;s a bad thing,\u0026rdquo; Bonnie said.\nEveryone turned to look at her.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced as profound a change in my life as anyone could imagine,\u0026rdquo; she began. \u0026ldquo;I know that I can never feel quite the same way as before, and that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing. I think it would be a good thing if some of the people who were after us became their own guinea pigs.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; said Annette putting a hand on her lover. \u0026ldquo;You were never going to be those people, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure they could become people like us. The siren cells are powerful, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure they insure morality. We need to empty or destroy this tank before we leave. Sorry Jack, it\u0026rsquo;s too dangerous. Look at the transgenetic effects we experienced just by accident. Imagine what could be done if the wrong military scientists tried to exploit the siren cell and the microorganisms in this tank.\u0026rdquo;\nJack sighed, looked deep into his tank, and closed his eyes. A single tear fell from the corner of his left eye. He opened them again.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;We will empty the tank.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Will the microorganisms survive in the bay?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;They might, but it is unlikely they will achieve a critical mass in a body of water this big,\u0026rdquo; Cassie answered. \u0026ldquo;We will all be mers by then, right? Well, then we should just chase all the fish out, and then cook the tank.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry,\u0026rdquo; Susan said again.\n\u0026ldquo;Cassie, I\u0026rsquo;m also with him,\u0026rdquo; she answered, similarly jerking her thumb towards Jack.\nSusan looked over the tall young woman. She had piercing blue eyes, long golden locks of hair, and a dramatic hourglass figure. She seemed more mature and knowledgeable than the average twenty something year old.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi Cassie, nice to meet you. Cook?\u0026rdquo; Susan asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I used to be a biology teacher,\u0026rdquo; Cassie said, answering the unspoken question in Susan\u0026rsquo;s eyes. \u0026ldquo;Cook, means to let it overheat, stop the filters, and kill everything that is left inside.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Won\u0026rsquo;t that mean that the cuttlefish will die?\u0026rdquo; Joy asked.\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;d die anyway with Stottomeyer\u0026rsquo;s thugs mucking about,\u0026rdquo; Jack said. \u0026ldquo;If this was summer time, they might survive in the bay for a few months, but the water is too cold for them, but I\u0026rsquo;d rather they died out there than in here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry Jack,\u0026rdquo; Cassie said. \u0026ldquo;I know how much you loved those creatures.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;But I think that I\u0026rsquo;ll have new sea creatures to whom I shall be more devoted.\u0026rdquo;\nCassie leaned over and kissed him.\n\u0026ldquo;We should get Susan, Bill, and Miriam started so that when James gets here tomorrow, Bill will be in a position to help things along,\u0026rdquo; Joy said.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Ward, actually,\u0026rdquo; Bill said.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry?\u0026rdquo; Joy said.\n\u0026ldquo;Ward,\u0026rdquo; he said again. \u0026ldquo;My family calls me Ward. It\u0026rsquo;s an old family nickname, and since we\u0026rsquo;re about to become a new family, you all should call me Ward. I hate the name Bill or William.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why didn\u0026rsquo;t you say anything before?\u0026rdquo; Susan asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Security regulations makes nicknames a pain in the ass,\u0026rdquo; Ward said. \u0026ldquo;But we\u0026rsquo;re past all that now. You should know the real me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ward, eh?\u0026rdquo; Susan said. \u0026ldquo;I kinda like that. My ward and shield?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve dreamed of hearing you say that for nearly twenty years,\u0026rdquo; Ward admitted.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, better late than never,\u0026rdquo; Susan said.\n\u0026ldquo;Agreed,\u0026rdquo; Ward said.\nThe evening stars twinkled in a cloudless sky, casting a cool blue light on the island below. The wind was still, the only sound was the waves softly washing up onto the sand. The beach was crowded with mers and humans, and in the middle of the cluster was an elderly Polynesian man who sat with his legs crossed and his chin in his hands.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s quite a story,\u0026rdquo; Conjo admitted. \u0026ldquo;And it was long in the telling.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re sorry about that,\u0026rdquo; the auburn haired mermaid admitted, her sea green tail flashing in the cool starlight. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re trying to get it shorter, but there\u0026rsquo;s so much.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And we\u0026rsquo;re not very good story tellers,\u0026rdquo; the white haired mermaid teased.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re Phoebe, right?\u0026rdquo; Conjo asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Phoebe answered. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re doing great!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you\u0026rsquo;re Pat,\u0026rdquo; said Conjo turning to the auburn haired mermaid.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s an awful lot of you. Hard to keep you all straight,\u0026rdquo; Conjo finished.\n\u0026ldquo;But we\u0026rsquo;re worth it,\u0026rdquo; said a golden-haired mermaid with a yellow-gold tail. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026quot;m Danni.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, thank you,\u0026rdquo; Conjo said.\n\u0026ldquo;So, now that you\u0026rsquo;re more or less caught up, what would you like to do?\u0026rdquo; Pat asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I would like Malaki to replace my wife,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;I believe that would serve both justice and love.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is more generous than many here are willing to be,\u0026rdquo; Pat warned. \u0026ldquo;We will have to think on this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Vidya said, rising. \u0026ldquo;There has been enough death, and we yet face more death in the future. We are not served by more death. Can you agree, my sister?\u0026rdquo; asked Vidya, turning towards Rani.\n\u0026ldquo;I \u0026hellip; I \u0026hellip; you ask too much,\u0026rdquo; confessed Rani, her eyes filled with tears.\n\u0026ldquo;There is a death, of a kind,\u0026rdquo; Liga said. \u0026ldquo;I do not believe that the person I was before would have or could have chosen this life I have now, and I am glad of his death. Perhaps we can reform even Malaki.\u0026rdquo;\nRani nodded, but she looked to Valencia. All eyes then turned towards Valencia. She looked at her pod seeing the love and support in their eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;If Conjo is willing to be master, I will not be an obstacle to this measure of justice,\u0026rdquo; Valencia said.\n\u0026ldquo;I am willing,\u0026rdquo; Conjo answered. \u0026ldquo;I will try to make some good come out of that lump of water, cells, and flesh.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In that case, you should feed from one of the mothers so that you have both the strength of body and of mer to force Malaki into these changes,\u0026rdquo; Pat said. \u0026ldquo;Whom do you choose?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If I may be so bold, may I ask of you?\u0026rdquo; Conjo said.\n\u0026ldquo;I am honored,\u0026rdquo; answered, Pat feeling the rise of hormones in her breasts. \u0026ldquo;Come, feed.\u0026rdquo;\nConjo rose from the sand and walked over to Pat. He sat next to her and took her left hand and brought it to his lips. He kissed it softly.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you. I hope to be worthy,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Here,\u0026rdquo; said Pat guiding his head to her breast. \u0026ldquo;Drink and you will become strong.\u0026rdquo;\nConjo took Pat\u0026rsquo;s nipple into his mouth and sucked. Warm, sweet mermaid milk erupted from her stiff nubbin, and Conjo drank. Energy and vitality surged through his body as he drained her breast in only a few minutes.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve still got to give Maureen her evening snack, so choose another,\u0026rdquo; Pat said.\n\u0026ldquo;Valencia, there is justice here if you can see it,\u0026rdquo; Conjo said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I will be pleased to help,\u0026rdquo; Valencia said, pulling her lush brown hair away from her breasts. \u0026ldquo;Take what you can.\u0026rdquo;\nConjo stood up and walked over to the beautiful young mermaid and sank down to the sand next to her. He let her guide his head to her breast and drink from her fullness. The rush of hormones nearly overwhelmed Valencia, and she sighed with pleasure as the old man drank from her breasts. When he had drained both breasts, he was full.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you,\u0026rdquo; Conjo said. \u0026ldquo;I hope to make a worthy merman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re already well on your way,\u0026rdquo; Harold said. \u0026ldquo;We mermen exist for our mates, and Valencia is happy that you\u0026rsquo;ve found a way to bring justice to her father without more death. Thank you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have far to travel, but the journey has begun,\u0026rdquo; Conjo said.\nTo be continued.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/changes-in-paradise17/","tags":["mermaids","transgender","transformation"],"title":"Changes in Paradise: Part 17 - Waiting, Wondering, Worrying"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"\u0026ldquo;So, all I have to do is drink that stuff?\u0026rdquo; Miu asked. For someone who had been super before, the question felt utterly strange to anybody else in the room.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Devil answered, before downing a small vial of her own. The impressive redhead didn\u0026rsquo;t show any sign of change - but unlike Miu she was super already and was just increasing her supply this way. Miu had never drunk a potion like this, but she understood that the other people in the room had gained their - temporary - powers that very way. \u0026ldquo;Alright, we\u0026rsquo;re good to go,\u0026rdquo; James exclaimed from behind a monitor. \u0026ldquo;Take it whenever you want.\u0026rdquo; He was referring to the countless machines that Miu had been hooked up in advance. The scientists wanted to get as many readings on the transformation process as possible so they stuck pretty much all they could find onto her. This - of course - included cameras. And those made the young woman a little bit self-conscious. Miu had no problems in having her vitals taken as she was interested in the results as well. But right now all Miu was wearing were panties and a loose tank top that was supposed to withstand her post-transformation physique. In other words she was practically naked in front of strangers and cameras. The only thing that calmed her down was the knowledge that she would turn into a woman that didn\u0026rsquo;t have to hide any of her super curves. \u0026ldquo;Ok then,\u0026rdquo; she said to herself as she brought the vial with green liquid to her lips. Closing her eyes, she downed its contents in one go. The first thing she noticed was the taste. It was great. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t put it into words, as her tongue was experiencing a sensory overload. After all the liquid was full of super energy and any part of her that came into contact with it, absorbed it like a sponge. By the time the liquid had made it to her stomach, the super energy was everywhere but there. Miu could feel it seeping into her brain, then her scalp. Her thoughts began to travel faster, her mind becoming quicker and at the same time she felt her hair grow down her back. Opening her now glowing green eyes again, Miu gave the camera a perfect smile as her improved eyesight examined the other people in the room. Unsurprisingly, Devil\u0026rsquo;s body was filled with super energy, but not as much as Susan and herself had sported last night. In James she spotted a bit of super energy as well, despite him not being in his super form right now. The other scientist - Deziree - sported noticeable less power. Remembering Blue-Eyes words from last night, Miu wondered if men were really quicker to recover their own super energy. Her attention turned back to her own changes which were happening faster by the second. Her arm, legs and torso lengthened in tandem while at the same time growing more muscular. After having spent most of the last night in this form, she considered this more to be her default form than the body she had been born with. The pleasure she felt in each and every cell as it was filled with the super energy was way better than her last transformation. Miu guessed that this must\u0026rsquo;ve been because the power had come directly from Blue-Eyes who was something like a brother to her and thus didn\u0026rsquo;t inspire any erotic feelings. The potion however did that - a lot. \u0026ldquo;Oh god,\u0026rdquo; she whispered as the final phase of her transformation started. With her body full, the excess energy now pressed into her breasts, causing them to expand from their puny size to what she estimated to be a DD cup. Needless to say that it was one of the best feelings she ever experienced, and her body became weightless as she struggled to maintain her composure. A few more seconds and it was over. Where before had stood a young unremarkable woman, was now a floating goddess with incredible powers. To empathize the difference, Miu started flexing - which caused her physique to explode to bodybuilder-like proportions for the moment. \u0026ldquo;Hope you liked the show,\u0026rdquo; she mused as she allowed her body to relax again. \u0026ldquo;Well we got some good readings,\u0026rdquo; James commented, as he rose from the table. \u0026ldquo;And while we try to interpret them in the right way, I think it would be best for you to start the next test run.\u0026rdquo; He held out two wristbands with the letters \u0026lsquo;GPS\u0026rsquo; on it. \u0026ldquo;These are the best trackers we have available right now. I\u0026rsquo;d like you to put them on - along with a few mobile monitoring devices - and then have a little race around the world.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;A flight race? Now that sounds way more fun that running on the treadmill,\u0026rdquo; Devil commented as she took the tracker. Miu had to agree, especially since this time the chances were much more even than before. Now with her being super as well, Devil would have a much harder time leaving her in the dust\nDebbie couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe her eyes: Right in front of her, laid a sleeping Michelle - several inches above the bench she should be lying on. The young woman couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe her luck yet at the same time a barrage of questions went through her head: What else could she do? Was Michelle aware of these abilities? How had she gained them? How was she connected to the Angel? The most pressing question however was whether Debbie should tell Michelle about her discovery once the latter woke up. After all, Michelle could be totally unaware about this and not believe Debbies words. Or she was aware and kept it to herself - a point Debbie understood quite well. In this case she might get more information by pretending not to know. But for now she had a first row seat for the most impressive sight in the entire gym - and fortunately nobody else was there to witness it too. She checked thrice to see if there was something other than air between Michelle and the bench. Nope, this was not a trick. Michelle was hovering and judging by the slight smile on her face she was enjoying it too. Debbie allowed her gaze to wander over her colleague\u0026rsquo;s body. When she had returned to town a few days ago, she had been surprised to see Michelle looking better than ever. But she hadn\u0026rsquo;t paid it too much mind. Back when they had changed into (and out) of their workout clothes, however she had already noticed that Michelle seemed a lot fitter than when she had last seen her. And now she had a free view on Michelle\u0026rsquo;s naked body. Usually she wasn\u0026rsquo;t one to examine another woman\u0026rsquo;s body like this, but given that it was capable of flying, Debbie made an exception. She remembered their earlier discussion about whether the incredible looks had been part of the Angel\u0026rsquo;s powers. Had Michelle referred to herself there? While she was clearly more beautiful and fit than she was before, Michelle still didn\u0026rsquo;t play in the Angel\u0026rsquo;s league. But maybe Debbie\u0026rsquo;s original assumption still applied and the Angel had looked like that even before she got these powers. Or at least good enough so that her empowering left her absolutely stunning. In the end, Debbie couldn\u0026rsquo;t answer any of these questions. As Michelle was slowly lowering to lie back down on the bench, Debbie decided to keep her discovery to herself. At one point Michelle might give her a bit of information that helps - and if she turns out to be unaware of her ability, Debbie can still tell her about it.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect them to be this fast,\u0026rdquo; Deziree exclaimed as she watched the monitor. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re already in Europe!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The more interesting part is that Devil is still faster than Miu.\u0026rdquo; James commented. \u0026ldquo;Or rather that Miu is slower than I expected her to.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s flying a good Mach 33, how fast have you expected her to be?\u0026rdquo; Deziree countered. \u0026ldquo;Devil is at Mach 35, I expected Miu to be about the same.\u0026rdquo; James explained. Of course, the main reason for that was that he himself had managed the same speed last night - while being utterly outclassed by Michelle. \u0026ldquo;Maybe Miu is subconsciously keeping herself back?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;And why would she do that?\u0026rdquo; Debbie raised her brow. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s a dancer who had been paralyzed for two years. Maybe she paid more attention to the fact that she could walk again rather than the newly acquired flying capacities.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hm, that could be a reason. But thenit would be a mental block rather than the lack of capability. We\u0026rsquo;ll have to check the readings to see if she actually gave it her all. Until then we\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not like we have a shortage of work to do. So what have you found out about this plant so far?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s still quite the mystery to be honest.\u0026rdquo; Deziree began. \u0026ldquo;The plant is quite resilient, but that was to be expected for it to survive the journey to earth on a meteor - even if it was just a seed. The really interesting part is - of course - the liquid it generates.\u0026rdquo; James nodded. \u0026ldquo;First of all the amount produced seems to scale with the amount of light and warmth it receives. Those seem to be more of a catalyst here. Like all plants it absorbs some of the light, but given the amount of energy stored inside this liquid, I have no idea where that comes from.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah, the energy required to lift aperson off the ground alone is more than such a plant could absorb from sunlight alone.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Exactly. But it also seems to react to human presence.\u0026rdquo; Deziree continued. \u0026ldquo;When left alone, the production would decrease after 12 and even halt after about 48 hours. Given that the liquid did contain some kind of retrovirus that is obviously responsible for the mutation after consuming it, it seems like the plant wants that to happen.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hm, interesting. It really seems like the plants consider it their way of reproduction if this liquid is ingested by other organisms.\u0026rdquo; James leaned back on his chair. So far their previous theories seemed to be correct. Apparently the plants had their own take on Darwin\u0026rsquo;s Law and pretty much fused with whatever creature they encountered. The resulting hybrid would become superior to both races and the question was what would happen then. Would the hybrids make both parent races obsolete and go on to fuse with another race in the upcoming generation? That would mean that there were previous incarnations that may not have looked like the plants did. \u0026ldquo;I wonder what it\u0026rsquo;s home planet looks like,\u0026rdquo; Deziree spoke again. \u0026ldquo;The wildlife there must be some sight to behold if the plants bestow this kind of power to any kind of creature.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;It would also be one of the most dangerous places to go in the universe. Imagine wild animals with super powers, how would you defend yourself against that?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Carnivores are unlikely to consume the liquid,\u0026rdquo; Deziree countered. \u0026ldquo;But yeah I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t bet my life on it. And thankfully traveling there is impossible.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hm that raises another good point: Would a hybrid be able to survive in space? Given enough super energy, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if the lack of oxygen would be no problem either.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;So I take it you didn\u0026rsquo;t try that one out\u0026hellip; then again neither did I. But speaking of which, what did you try out last night? After all you already know about my late-night visit here.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Well, uhm\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; James blushed. \u0026ldquo;We tested out to see how the super powers react to different genders. So far all we found out was that men seem to have more physical strength.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;That was to be expected. But how is it with other powers, do you think you could keep up with those two when it comes to flying.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Actually I was more on Devil\u0026rsquo;s level than Miu\u0026rsquo;s here. So when it comes to flight there isn\u0026rsquo;t much of a gender difference, just different levels of training.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Given the strength levels at play, the flight power would be the bottleneck in most confrontations. Yesterday the major part of the battle seemed to happen over the city instead of inside the lab.\u0026rdquo; James nodded, not wanting to admit that Michelle outclassed not only him but anybody else in terms of flight - which had been a factor in yesterday\u0026rsquo;s fight with Ms. Harland. After a short while Deziree spoke again. \u0026ldquo;Just out of curiosity, did you look the same way the man Miu described did?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Uhm, yeah. Apparently there\u0026rsquo;s not too much variation in terms of physique for supers.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call that a bad thing,\u0026rdquo; Deziree mused her mind clearly drifting off with an awkward smile before she suddenly shook her head and regained her composure. \u0026ldquo;How about capacity? I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s clear where female supers store the excess super energy. But for men that\u0026rsquo;s not an option. So unless there\u0026rsquo;s some kind of alternative wouldn\u0026rsquo;t men hit her maximum capacity much earlier than women?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Uhm\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; actually James had all but forgotten about this aspect. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t drink too much of the potion, so it\u0026rsquo;s only natural that I didn\u0026rsquo;t hit my limit. From what we know I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have turned back to normal if I did, actually. But you\u0026rsquo;re probably right, all in all the capacity should be smaller for men.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is there something on my face?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked as she noticed Debbie staring at her. She didn\u0026rsquo;t like that her colleague had suddenly decided to pay a lot more attention to her after they left the gym. \u0026ldquo;I was just surprised that you have quite the appetite today. Didn\u0026rsquo;t remember you to be like that.\u0026rdquo; Michelle took another bite, giving her colleague a skeptical look. \u0026ldquo;We were just in the gym, working out. Of course I\u0026rsquo;m hungry afterwards.\u0026rdquo; She was quite thankful that Debbie hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen her for quite some time. This way the outward changes that Michelle had gone through in a few days, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t stick out as much. Still, she was vary that Debbie might notice that her changes weren\u0026rsquo;t exactly normal. \u0026ldquo;True, so you gave it your all in the gym, heh? That explains why you fell asleep in the sauna.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s dangerous to fall asleep in such a heat, I got it the first time around,\u0026rdquo; Michelle said. \u0026ldquo;So what are the plans for the afternoon? Roaming the streets again?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hm, let me check.\u0026rdquo; Debbie took out her phone and went through her messages. \u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed after a while. \u0026ldquo;Damn this could\u0026rsquo;ve gone faster!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked, now curious about what Debbie had been texted. \u0026ldquo;Apparently the Angel fought another superwoman at a research facility nearby. The other superwoman was then arrested, but broke out of jail last night.\u0026rdquo; Michelle all but spat out her drink. \u0026ldquo;How had she broken out?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Through the outside wall. Guess that was to be expected from a woman that\u0026rsquo;s super strong and can fly.\u0026rdquo; Not if she\u0026rsquo;s out of power - Michelle thought to herself, but knew that Debbie had no means to know that. \u0026ldquo;Well at least that means you\u0026rsquo;re in the right city to find the Angel,\u0026rdquo; she commented. \u0026ldquo;Too bad the bad girl broke out, otherwise we could have interviewed her.\u0026rdquo; Not that Michelle really wanted that. \u0026ldquo;True, but now we have a lead. The research facility was specializing in the meteor aftermath. If two superwomen decided to fight there, then it\u0026rsquo;s obvious that there is something to be found there.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got a point,\u0026rdquo; Michelle admitted, not liking this turn of events. She should have expected for Debbie to catch wind of this incident. She just hoped that they would get chased off here. \u0026ldquo;Of course I do, so after we eat up we\u0026rsquo;ll drive over there and see what we can find out.\u0026rdquo; Michelle bit her lip. There would be at least two \u0026lsquo;official\u0026rsquo; superwomen there along with two scientists who had been super too. Adding herself to it would make it the biggest amount of supers at one place so far, of that Michelle was sure.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, that was number thirteen,\u0026rdquo; Susan exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;Guess you better take a break and recharge before we get to the rest of your one-night stands.\u0026rdquo; Blue-Eyes simply nodded in response before evaporating into thin air. Using her tracking ability on him, she quickly found him a few thousand miles south - where the sun was the most intensive right now. It would still take a bit for him to recover enough. \u0026ldquo;Thirteen,\u0026rdquo; she repeated. \u0026ldquo;Seven out of thirteen. Not that good a rate.\u0026rdquo; What she was referring to was the amount of individual superpowers she had gained from the women Blue-Eyes had brought. By now she was doubting if the term individual was really fitting. Two of the women didn\u0026rsquo;t have any special power at all, while others simply had developed the same kinds of powers unaffected by each other. Fortunately none of them had developed powers that made them immune to - or capable of - mind control. So there were now thirteen more girls that just thought that Susan was the best person in the world and who would do anything to please her. The blonde goddess smiled. Her mind control was quite subtle, allowing the affected to remain their normal self. Only Blue-eyes had been damaged to the point that his personality was rather simple now. But he still proved quite useful. Activating her X-ray vision, she spotted her new slaves together with Sandy and the men they had brought back last night hanging out at the pool. Where last night Susan, Miu and Sandy had to share the seven normal guys, these very same men had now two supergirls each: Sandy plus the thirteen newcomers. Susan feared that they might start to argue or even fight about them, but thankfully had ordered them not to cause a ruckus beforehand. What happened out there was pretty much just a pool party - but right now Susan didn\u0026rsquo;t want to join in. She needed time to plan her next moves, so she teleported herself to a secluded place in the park she had visited often as a child. In the blink of an eye she appeared in the park, instantly recognizing the place she had last seen over ten years ago. She had to giggle. As nice as it was to be able to fly, nothing was quicker than teleportation. Just as she was about to lean back in midair, Susan picked up a gulp somewhere behind her. Turning around in midair, she quickly spotted the culprit. There was a guy sitting there, leaned to a tree with a sketchbook in his hands. He was staring at her with an open mouth, obviously still shocked about the stunning blonde that had appeared out of thin air. In terms of looks, he wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much to speak of. He was wearing a washed-out T-shirt that depicted the diamond shaped S that was usually associated with Superman, but thanks to his scrawny physique made him look like a parody of the comic book character. The utter lack of super energy in him drove the point home that he was just a nerd. \u0026ldquo;And who do we have here?\u0026rdquo; she asked in a condescending tone. It helped that she was still hovering several feet above the ground. The guy just gulped again, and stared at her for a few more seconds. \u0026ldquo;I asked you a question,\u0026rdquo; Susan added with pretended anger. Of course she could force him to act accordingly with her mind control, but a part of her liked his speechlessness way to much. \u0026ldquo;My n-name is P-P-Peter,\u0026rdquo; he stammered after a while. \u0026ldquo;Nice to meet you,\u0026rdquo; he added with a blush. \u0026ldquo;Hello Peter, what are you doing out here?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Uhm\u0026hellip; drawing,\u0026rdquo; he answered blushing even further. His hands gripped the sketchbook tighter. \u0026ldquo;Oh an artist?\u0026rdquo; she asked with a mocking tone. \u0026ldquo;Now I\u0026rsquo;m interested. I\u0026rsquo;d really like to see your work.\u0026rdquo; Susan held out her hand in demand of his sketchbook. Peter looked at her in shock and shook his head. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not that good to be shown to anyone … hey!\u0026rdquo; As he tried to clutch the sketchbook tight to him, it suddenly flew out of his hand and into Susan\u0026rsquo;s, who then proceeded to open it. \u0026ldquo;T-telekinesis?\u0026rdquo; he stammered, mostly to himself. \u0026ldquo;The candidate gets hundred points!\u0026rdquo; Susan exclaimed as she stuck out her tongue. Then she focused on the pictures he had drawn. All of them depicted women lifting tanks, flying through the air and generally performing feats that she herself had thought impossible just a week ago. What stuck out was that these women were barely clothed. Those that wore a costume of sorts had it damaged to the point where their dignity was no longer intact. \u0026ldquo;You seem to have an interesting taste,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed with her usual mocking tone. \u0026ldquo;Uhm, well … you see\u0026hellip; I … uh\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The color of his face vanished and he clearly began to sweat uncontrollably. Together with his high pulse, Susan deduced that he was about to have a panic attack. \u0026ldquo;You ok?\u0026rdquo; she asked with a much more friendly voice than she had intended. Gulping, he seemed to get a hold on himself. \u0026ldquo;This is just embarrassing\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he whispered, blushing again as he noticed that Susan was still eyeing the pictures he had drawn. \u0026ldquo;They are quite good,\u0026rdquo; she commented. \u0026ldquo;How long do you need for one?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;T-thank you\u0026hellip; \u0026quot; Peter actually managed to smile after the compliment. \u0026ldquo;It usually takes a few days at least. Some of my better pieces took months to complete.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;So, in other words, you have been drawing these for a while now. Not just since that other one appeared a few days ago?\u0026rdquo; Peter nodded, his face still crimson but his pulse seemed to have slowed down considerably. In fact, he became a bit more confident as Susan flipped through the book searching for those better pieces. \u0026ldquo;A-are you a friend of the … other one?\u0026rdquo; Susan glared at him, causing him to back away against the tree he had been leaning against. \u0026ldquo;I-I take this as a no,\u0026rdquo; he quickly answered. \u0026ldquo;Well you\u0026rsquo;re a lot nicer anyway.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;My, aren\u0026rsquo;t you charming?\u0026rdquo; Susan mocked him. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s almost as if you knew that I could break every bone in your body with nothing but my pinky.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;W-well, and then there\u0026rsquo;s the fact that you\u0026rsquo;re actually talking to me while she wasn\u0026rsquo;t very talkative at all.\u0026rdquo; Peter was obviously grasping at straws here. \u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t argue with that, although I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure why I am talking to you, either. Maybe you should try to be a bit more useful for me?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;U-useful? Do you want me to draw you or something?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Me posing for you? That would be the day!\u0026rdquo; Susan burst into laughter, but quickly stopped herself when she noticed his disappointment. \u0026ldquo;Ok maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll strike a pose or two for you and you can make a picture out of that in my absence. But what I actually wanted was you knowledge on the issue.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What issue?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Super powers of course!\u0026rdquo; Susan beamed back. \u0026ldquo;You seem quite knowledgeable on that front.\u0026rdquo; Peter blushed again. \u0026ldquo;Just because I have read a few comic books doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I\u0026rsquo;m an expert on super powers. Especially not real ones. Maybe you should seek out a doctor for that.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;A friend of mine is already covering the scientific approach. But if you\u0026rsquo;re not up to the challenge, I guess I can always find another nerd who\u0026rsquo;s all too eager to help me.\u0026rdquo; Susan turned around and began to hover away from him. \u0026ldquo;Wait!\u0026rdquo; he blurted out. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t say I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t try, did I?\u0026rdquo; Susan smiled to herself. She didn\u0026rsquo;t need to use her mind control to make him do what she wanted. Facing him, she said \u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; all while still smiling. \u0026ldquo;Yes, if you tell me how your powers work, I guess I might be able to draw some conclusions from that.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;And you probably want me to show some of them to you too?\u0026rdquo; Susan teased. \u0026ldquo;T-that would be aweso… I mean helpful … yes, helpful.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Then we better get started, shall we?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean no press allowed?\u0026rdquo; Debbie shouted. \u0026ldquo;Seriously, I\u0026rsquo;m not asking you to give us full access to the building, we just want to talk to one of your superiors.\u0026amp;quot \u0026ldquo;And these superiors all decided that there should be no press here unless they ask for it,\u0026rdquo; came the cold reply of the receptionist. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, but you two won\u0026rsquo;t get an appointment today.\u0026rdquo; Michelle was quite happy with that development. She didn\u0026rsquo;t really want for Debbie to find out about the events that had taken place here yesterday. What\u0026rsquo;s more was that she didn\u0026rsquo;t want Debbie to find out her boyfriend worked here. Michelle had refrained from telling her that because she would want to take advantage of this connection. Anyway the best outcome was that they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get past the entrance. \u0026ldquo;Is there a problem?\u0026rdquo; came a familiar male voice. Michelle turned around to recognize Detective Jacob Spencer, who already flashed his badge. Debbie however wasn\u0026rsquo;t impressed. \u0026ldquo;My partner and I are just here to get a statement about the incident that happened here yesterday.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;And what would that incident be?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Some super chick attacks this facility, the Angel stops her. She gets arrested but breaks out later that night.\u0026rdquo; Debbie explained. Jacob\u0026rsquo;s expression darkened at the amount of information Debbie just threw around. In doing so, however he fell into her trap. His expression showed anger rather than surprise which confirmed that he knew about this. At the same time the receptionist had remained quite calm – at least until Debbie mentioned Susan\u0026rsquo;s breakout. Obviously she became nervous that another attack could happen again. \u0026ldquo;Listen, how about we sit down somewhere and talk about it. They won\u0026rsquo;t receive you anyway.\u0026rdquo; Jacob came up with a rather strange proposal. \u0026ldquo;I hope you have more to say than my contact,\u0026rdquo; Debbie concluded. Michelle however rolled her eyes. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t off the hook yet.\n\u0026ldquo;It looks like Miu really didn\u0026rsquo;t give it her all,\u0026rdquo; Deziree commented as she compared the readings they had gathered from their race around the world. \u0026ldquo;At least in the beginning that is. Once you reached Asia you seem to have caught up to Devil in terms of speed.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t help me win the race,\u0026rdquo; Miu commented cheerfully. \u0026ldquo;Flying around the world in less than an hour is awesome enough as it is, no hard feelings if I take a few minutes more than Devil.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;At least that confirms that the flying speed is about the same level per person.\u0026rdquo; James concluded. \u0026ldquo;But there\u0026rsquo;s one thing I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand,\u0026rdquo; Miu exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;The two of you turned super yesterday, right?\u0026rdquo; Deziree and James shared an uncomfortable look. \u0026ldquo;Yes, why are you asking?\u0026rdquo; he answered. \u0026ldquo;I think she means that you\u0026rsquo;re already visibly regenerating the super energy while Dr. Archer is basically empty. I\u0026rsquo;m actually a bit surprised that you didn\u0026rsquo;t burst out of your clothes already,\u0026rdquo; Amanda commented. \u0026ldquo;What? Is it really that much already?\u0026rdquo; James acted surprised. \u0026ldquo;Well someone showed me how to keep myself together like this, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect it to be noticeable already.\u0026rdquo; The truth was, that it had started rather slow and subtle, but the speed with which he regenerated had steadily increased. \u0026ldquo;Now that\u0026rsquo;s interesting,\u0026rdquo; Deziree interrupted. \u0026ldquo;I wonder why you are already regenerating and neither of us is. Maybe it depends on the gender, meaning that men regenerate faster than women?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s probably it,\u0026rdquo; Miu agreed. \u0026ldquo;Or maybe he simply triggered this ability unlike any of us. Remember that someone made her first transformation permanent. If the regeneration also needs some kind of trigger, then it could have been plain luck.\u0026rdquo; Amanda exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;And what could be that kind of trigger?\u0026rdquo; Miu countered before facing James again. \u0026ldquo;What did you do while you were super?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Well…\u0026rdquo; James blushed. \u0026ldquo;Nothing out of the ordinary, I suppose.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll need a bit more details than that,\u0026rdquo; Deziree teased. \u0026ldquo;W-what am I supposed to say here? We had sex, okay? I\u0026rsquo;m really not willing to go into every tiny detail about it.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Oh but now we really want to know every detail!\u0026rdquo; Miu joined in. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve had sex during my first time as a super too and it didn\u0026rsquo;t cause me to regenerate at all.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Maybe it was because his partner was super too? Could that be a trigger?\u0026rdquo; Amanda suggested. \u0026ldquo;That could be it. But in this case his partner would be regenerating too. Maybe we should ask her?\u0026rdquo; Deziree proposed. \u0026ldquo;It may be better if I ask her myself,\u0026rdquo; James tried to end this part of their conversation. He wanted to get Michelle as far out of focus as possible.\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously? This is barely more than what my contact told me!\u0026rdquo; Debbie exclaimed after Jacob had finished his story. \u0026ldquo;How did that other superwoman look like?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;She looked quite similar to the Angel actually. The main difference was their eye color. This one had golden while the Angel has blue eyes.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Even the physique?\u0026rdquo; Debbie seemed rather surprised. This conversation was a strange game of cat and mouse. Jacob was giving out his information in rather small packages and Debbie was always forced to ask for further details. It took a while for Michelle to figure out why he did that: he was trying to figure out Debbie\u0026rsquo;s contact. \u0026ldquo;Yes, even the physique,\u0026rdquo; Jacob answered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve seen them both right next to each other, the only apparent difference was their eyes.\u0026rdquo; Michelle did her best not to blurt out anything. While it was true that Susan and she were looking quite similar, there were several small differences between them. She wondered if these outside differences were so small, that it took super senses to even recognize them. Hey sweetheart, do you have a minute? James thought\u0026rsquo;s popped up in her head. For you anytime, she mentally answered. Any new discoveries? Actually yes, that\u0026rsquo;s why I contact you. How quickly do you regenerate super energy right now? Did it speed up since last night? You could say that. This is the first time that I actually notice that my body recovers over the day. Before it was almost nothing. Why do you ask? Is it the same for you too? Yes, which didn\u0026rsquo;t go unnoticed by the other women here, especially those who can see it right now. We were wondering whether that was a gender thing or if the regeneration was somehow triggered. Since it\u0026rsquo;s the same for you, it\u0026rsquo;s probably the latter. What do you mean triggered? Well, we did redecorate that small island, you know? And we were both super at that time. Michelle gulped at the thought of that. Had their lovemaking been the trigger? She had paid almost no attention to her supply back then. Still it sounded like a long shot. Maybe it was something else? She mentally asked. This is still just a theory, came the answer. After all it was the only thing out of the ordinary last night. To prove it we would need to test it. Oh I\u0026rsquo;m all for testing it once more, Michelle almost blushed as she thought back to last night. Detective Spencer gave her a curious look, but then turned back to Debbie to continue their game of cat and mouse. Pretending to feel hot, she looked through her bag for a small bottle of water. Since we\u0026rsquo;re already affected, the testing would have to be done by someone other than us. Which would mean giving the potion to yet another person. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I like that. It\u0026rsquo;s not like there are plans for a test yet. But I guess someone will try it out eventually. Their mental dialogue was suddenly stopped by the sound of a ringing phone. \u0026ldquo;Spencer,\u0026rdquo; Jacob answered his phone. Debbie turned around to Michelle, all but asking \u0026ldquo;What do you think about that.\u0026rdquo; Michelle simply shrugged since she had barely paid attention to the last parts of their conversation. Right now curiosity got the better of her and she activated her super hearing in order to eavesdrop on Det. Spencer\u0026rsquo;s phone call. \u0026ldquo;You wanted me to call you if there is a major crisis, Detective,\u0026rdquo; a man\u0026rsquo;s voice said through the phone. Michelle expected him to be a few years younger than Det. Spencer. \u0026ldquo;Already found something?\u0026rdquo; Jacob tried to sound nonchalantly. \u0026ldquo;Yes, and truth be told I\u0026rsquo;d rather not have heard about it either,\u0026rdquo; the other man sounded clearly nervous now. \u0026ldquo;Apparently there has been a security breach at the power plant. Some guy is on his way to the reactor core.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Are you kidding me?\u0026rdquo; Jacob couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep up his façade for long as he all but shouted into the phone. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t just walk into something like this!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Apparently this guy did. Trust me, I would consider this a joke too, but apparently this guy has super powers. I have no idea what he wants there, but it sure can\u0026rsquo;t be good.\u0026rdquo; Jacob\u0026rsquo;s face lost all color. \u0026ldquo;Alright, I get the situation, I\u0026rsquo;ll see what I can do.\u0026rdquo; He was still trying to play it cool, but Debbie clearly didn\u0026rsquo;t fall for that. Call me! Michelle mentally ordered. I need a reason to leave here right now. \u0026ldquo;Excuse me ladies,\u0026rdquo; Jacob began, \u0026ldquo;I got to go now, how about we continue this discussion another time.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;And what would that something be? It sure sounds important,\u0026rdquo; Debbie countered. Before Jacob could even try to answer, Michelle\u0026rsquo;s phone rang as well. \u0026ldquo;Hello?\u0026rdquo; Michelle pretended. \u0026ldquo;You need to slip out? What for?\u0026rdquo; James asked on the other end. \u0026ldquo;What? … Really? … All right, I\u0026rsquo;ll come ASAP!\u0026rdquo; Those were the things Michelle said out lout while she mentally informed James about the call Jacob had gotten. \u0026ldquo;Sorry Debbie, private emergency. Gotta fly too.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Seriously?\u0026rdquo; Debbie looked at her, upset. But her expression returned to normal almost instantly. \u0026ldquo;Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s call it a day then.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad you understand, bye\u0026rdquo; Michelle shouted as she ran to the exit, barely caring about how weird her sudden departure must look to them. If the stuff she had heard was true, then this was one hell of a major crisis and she needed to hurry. Once outside she quickly disappeared in the next best back alley and took to the sky once she was sure nobody saw her. Thank goodness she had some super energy at her disposal right now, otherwise she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be able to interfere at all. Seconds later she was at her apartment, stripping out of her clothes mid-flight as she quickly allowed herself to transform into her super form. With the super energy inside her already, the process was almost instantaneous. Michelle quickly hovered to her fridge and downed several doses worth of super potion - this could be another fight after all. One instant later she was out of her apartment, now dressed in her costume and flying towards the power plant in question. From the outside, the power plant looked like it was business as usual, except for the alarm that was going off. Michelle quickly used her X-ray vision to find out where the culprit behind that had hidden. Thankfully, the thick walls and radiation shields didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to affect her X-ray vision. Maybe she should find another name for that. The bigger problem was that she had no deeper knowledge about how a nuclear plant was designed, so she didn\u0026rsquo;t know where to look at first. Then she realized that she should focus on the places with the thickest shieling - those were the ones where damage had to be prevented. Eventually, she found him in the reactor core, fiddling with the rods that were installed there. Instantly Michelle made her way through the entrance. This was the reactor of a nuclear power plant, so it was no option to simply burst through the thick walls. Not even that guy had done it. Michelle had no other choice than to fly through the hallways as quickly as possible, hoping she would reach that man before he reached whatever he wanted. But what did this guy want? Judging by his physique he was super, so he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to bother about the radiation but that didn\u0026rsquo;t explain his intentions. \u0026ldquo;Reactors 1, 3 and 4 down, Reactor 2 on 25% output. Damn, he\u0026rsquo;s messing with the control rods!\u0026rdquo; a voice came out of several speakers that Michelle passed. As she rushed through the hallways Michelle found several members of the staff unconscious. From the looks of it they had been thrown against the walls with great force but otherwise the injuries seemed minimal. Or at least Michelle hoped so. She had not the time to take a close look at them, much less to do something about it. There were much more lives at stake than just them. Following the trail, the culprit had left for her, she quickly reached what was probably Reactor 2. The man\u0026rsquo;s physique reminded her of James after he had taken the potion and even the eyes were just as blue as his – or Michelle\u0026rsquo;s own for that matter. Still, Michelle spotted enough differences in their faces and hair that she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to confuse this man for her boyfriend. Michelle was relieved to notice that the man fiddling with the reactor core had less super energy at his disposal than she had. The relief was only short-lived since in that very moment, the man ripped the reactor core itself open, causing a cloud of steam to arise that Michelle was convinced to be radioactive. The man however didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to care and it quickly became apparent why: Whenever he came into contact with it, his supply of super energy would increase a bit. He was absorbing the heat – and possibly the radiation - from the steam. \u0026ldquo;Hey!\u0026rdquo; she shouted, but the man didn\u0026rsquo;t listen. Instead, grabbed into it and pulled out a few rods that he dropped next to the core. He repeated that for a few more seconds until he changed his mind and began to bend the rods that were still inside. A quick glance with her X-ray vision confirmed it: he wanted to fit inside. But before he could put this plan into motion, she had tackled him away from the core. \u0026ldquo;Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m talking to you!\u0026rdquo; she shouted again, hoping that he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t turn this into a fight. But what stared back at her didn\u0026rsquo;t seem very angry. In fact, this guy seemed rather confused by her interference. \u0026ldquo;Need to recharge,\u0026rdquo; he said with a monotone voice. And just like that, he shoved Michelle away. The force he used would have been strong enough to have her crashed against a wall, but Michelle managed to stop herself in midair about ten feet away. Still, this had given him the time he needed to get back up, and jump into the reactor core. \u0026ldquo;What is your problem?\u0026rdquo; she asked as his head still stuck out of it. He looked at her with a blank expression. \u0026ldquo;Used too much power, need to recharge.\u0026rdquo; By now he was very well on his way to solve that problem. The boiling hot and irradiated water were like an all you can eat buffet to recharging his supply of super energy. Even from several feet away, she could feel her own body absorbing the heat and radiation, a pleasant distraction in a grim situation. Michelle wondered how this guy had been smart enough to know that a nuclear reactor could indeed recharge them faster while at the same time, he sounded like a broken record. Something must be wrong with his head. The first thing that had come to mind had been Susan Harland\u0026rsquo;s mind control shemes yesterday. But those had been rather tame and Michelle had even been able to counter them remotely in James' case. Whatever the reason, Michelle was convinced that things would go smoother, if she managed to get him to think normally again. But how? It had been her unique connection to James that had enabled her to free him from the spell that\u0026hellip; Her eyes widened. After her battle with Susan she had absorbed her remaining energy and gained her mind control power in the process. While she didn\u0026rsquo;t like that particular power up, Michelle figured that it might help in setting his head straight. Without a second thought, she stared into his eyes, and gave it a try. Focusing the super energy in her eyes, she tried to make a connection. \u0026ldquo;Get a hold of yourself!\u0026rdquo; she ordered. There was a strange feeling in her mind, and Michelle was convinced it meant that it worked. Since it was subtle, she could even understand why Susan wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have noticed using this power yesterday. The man winced, as if he suddenly had a headache, but he quickly shook it off. \u0026ldquo;Wow, that actually helped,\u0026rdquo; he commented, before giving her a sleazy grin. \u0026ldquo;Good, now get out of there!\u0026rdquo; Michelle ordered, infuriated by his grin and not caring that she still had her mind control powers active. \u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; was all he said before disappearing into thin air. Michelle looked at the reactor core in stunned silence. He had vanished into thin air! She smiled as she realized that she had resolved this incident without a fight. It made her feel all warm and fuzzy. Then she realized that it was something else that caused this pleasant feeling. With the man out of the reactor core it was her turn to recharge. And it felt really good to do so. She liked it more by the second Her eyes widened as she realized what that meant. The core was getting hotter. When he was in there, this guy had prevented this by absorbing the excess heat, but now the chain reaction could go unhalted. Michelle reacted out of instinct. With him gone, only her own body could absorb the excess heat to prevent a meltdown. Without a second thought, she jumped into the reactor core. \u0026ldquo;Uhhhh,\u0026rdquo; she moaned as the heat enveloped her. Her body reacted the same way it had done during the fire a few days ago: by transforming the excess heat into super energy. For a moment, Michelle allowed herself to get lost in the pleasant sensations that were caused by that. After a few seconds she could feel the temperature decrease - and along with it the flow of power into her. Thanks to this, Michelle realized one big flaw in her plan: her limited capacity. No matter how much energy her body could store, the nuclear reactor produced much more than she could take.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part18/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 18"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"Midnight was long-past but Miu didn\u0026rsquo;t feel tired at all. Her body was still filled to the brim with super energy and the dancing she had done so far may have been beyond the capabilities of humans, but not enough to actually put a hole into her energy supply.\nBesides her one almost-crash with another woman, she didn\u0026rsquo;t really have to use her super powers here and that was fine with her. Miu enjoyed the attention she was getting, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to make it that obvious that she was more than human right now. The late hour didn\u0026rsquo;t go unnoticed on the other people in the club however, and Miu didn\u0026rsquo;t want to let her opportunity slide again. She looked around at the men who had tried to impress her. Of course impressing a woman that could defy gravity, lift several tons and all sorts of other cool stuff wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly easy, but it took them a while to realize that. Now, only few of them still bore hope to actually approach her. It was time to pick the lucky winner, a decision Miu had avoided so far. Her last time with a man had been very bad for his health, and she felt wary of trying it again. That\u0026rsquo;s when she noticed him. Her unnamed benefactor had entered the club again. To her supernatural eyesight he stuck out in the crowd, since she could see the super energy inside him. She was about to ignore him when he beckoned her to follow. Now, that was odd. When he had left a short while ago, it had seemed like he would rather avoid any other meeting with her. She turned to her admirers. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be right back,\u0026rdquo; and then made her way out of the club. Miu could practically feel the other guys noticing her blue-eyed benefactor and sigh in disappointment. These men had no chance in a direct comparison with him, so it was to be expected. After all they didn\u0026rsquo;t know about their powers or how her ascension had turned her into a relative of his. When she returned, Miu decided, she would call him her half-brother. That was close enough to the truth to build up their hopes, in case they waited for her, that is. For now she followed her benefactor into a small alley \u0026ndash; the same side street where she had turned from her normal self to the goddess she was now. The Asian woman smiled as she remembered that feeling. She wondered what he wanted from her, and then noticed that he didn\u0026rsquo;t seem quite as powerful as before. Apparently he had exhausted the extra energy that the plant inside his body provided and now he actually noticed it becoming less. \u0026ldquo;Is there something the matter?\u0026rdquo; Miu asked when they were out of earshot. He only pointed upwards. As Miu\u0026rsquo;s gaze followed his direction, she spotted a woman that was just as filled to the brim with power as she was hovering above them. The other woman was blonde, with captivating golden eyes that were locked on her. For a moment, Miu thought that this must be the Angel that had been seen on TV, but then she remembered that the latter had glowing blue eyes. Thanks to the less-than-clear images on TV, she had no means of knowing how much further their similarity would go. Her outfit was different from the Angel\u0026rsquo;s as well: She was wearing a pink tank-top and yoga pants that clung to her body like a second skin. Given her own experience with creating clothes, she figured that hers had been created, too. Her exposed belly with the defined six-pack and her overall flawless appearance made Miu a bit jealous of the hovering \u0026ndash; until she remembered that she played in the same league. The blonde beckoned Miu towards her– and, after quickly checking that nobody could see her, Miu became airborne as well, and quickly crossed the distance between them. The other woman smiled at her, but at the same time her posture was commanding. \u0026ldquo;Hi,\u0026rdquo; she greeted with the sweetest voice. \u0026ldquo;Our common friend kept rambling about you, so I just had to meet you. I\u0026rsquo;m Susan.\u0026rdquo; Susan held out her hand and Miu shook it. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m Miu.\u0026rdquo; Why did this woman make her feel nervous? It couldn\u0026rsquo;t be her unnatural eye color; after all she had not felt so intimidated by Devil, whose orange eyes were just as unnatural. \u0026ldquo;W-why do you want to meet me?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t that obvious?\u0026rdquo; Susan asked. \u0026ldquo;Because we\u0026rsquo;re in the same boat and, apparently, you are quite knowledgeable about what happened to us.\u0026rdquo; Miu felt herself blush. \u0026ldquo;Aww, it\u0026rsquo;s not that much, actually. I only had luck to meet someone who knew more about it than myself.\u0026rdquo; Susan smiled. \u0026ldquo;Which brings us back to why I met with you. You may know more than I do, so I\u0026rsquo;d like you to tell me everything that you know about it.\u0026rdquo; Her golden eyes glowed brighter as she said the last part, and Miu suddenly felt compelled to tell this stranger everything she had learned so far. She began to tell Susan everything she had been through regarding their powers. Starting from her first transformation, going over her revenge on her previous rapist, up to her encounter with Devil and Dr. Thompson. For several minutes she rambled, often interrupted by follow-up questions of Susan. \u0026ldquo;So, the scientists are assuming that reaching your full capacity will mode-lock you?\u0026rdquo; Susan asked. \u0026ldquo;How did they come to that conclusion?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Devil only said that a friend of hers, the Angel, had figured it out. She didn\u0026rsquo;t say how. But looking at our common friend down there, it seems logical.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Have you reached your maximum capacity when he powered you up?\u0026rdquo; Miu shook her head, wondering the same thing about Susan. \u0026ldquo;I stopped it right before I reached that level so that I can turn back to normal afterwards. H-how about you?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Oh, I hit the maximum capacity and didn\u0026rsquo;t turn back to normal, which matches the theory so far.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Sorry to hear that,\u0026rdquo; Miu commented. Susan just burst into laughter. \u0026ldquo;Why would you be sorry? Just look at us! We\u0026rsquo;re much better than we were before and, instead of being easy victims, we can do what we want. I like being this powerful.\u0026rdquo; Miu didn\u0026rsquo;t doubt the sincerity of that statement. \u0026ldquo;A-and what do you want?\u0026rdquo; A naughty smile appeared on Susan\u0026rsquo;s perfect face. \u0026ldquo;What do I want, indeed.\u0026rdquo; Then her gaze went downwards to the club where Miu had been in just earlier. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like to get myself a guy and then let him explore every inch of this perfect body as he treats me like the goddess I am! How about you?\u0026rdquo; A gulp escaped Miu at the sudden exclamation. Her own plans were remarkably similar, and had mostly been thwarted by her fear she\u0026rsquo;d crush any would-be lover like she had done the last one. \u0026ldquo;W-well, that sounds nice.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Alright then, it\u0026rsquo;s settled.\u0026rdquo; Susan exclaimed with a smile. In the very same moment, gravity suddenly reclaimed its hold on her and the blonde woman descended to the road. It took Miu a second to notice that Susan had done so on purpose, gracefully controlling her descent before landing on the asphalt. Miu quickly followed her and noticed that Susan grinned towards the road, or rather the dents her landing had left there. \u0026ldquo;Blue-Eyes, we\u0026rsquo;re going!\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed and Miu remembered that the two women weren\u0026rsquo;t alone. \u0026ldquo;Yes Mistress,\u0026rdquo; came the voice of their benefactor whom Susan had reduced to his eye-color. Why was he obeying her like this? Right now he may have less power than any of the women, but nevertheless it had been him who had given them as much, after all. Then again, maybe he was just exhausted for once. Getting back into the club was no problem for them. Both Miu and Blue-Eyes had been there before, and all that Susan needed to do was flash her golden eyes and she was allowed to enter. Inside there wasn\u0026rsquo;t much going on anymore. Miu should have expected this, given that it was the middle of the night on a weekday. \u0026ldquo;You know these guys?\u0026rdquo; Susan asked as she gestured towards a group of men. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026hellip;– well, they tried to flirt with me before I left,\u0026rdquo; Miu hesitantly answered. This didn\u0026rsquo;t escape Susan. \u0026ldquo;Is there something the matter?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just a bit nervous. The last guy I was with was seriously injured because of my power.\u0026rdquo; Susan rolled her eyes, but then hesitated as she realized that it did indeed bother Miu. \u0026ldquo;Okay, let me help you a bit here. Look into my eyes!\u0026rdquo; Miu was a bit confused, but did as she was told. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re confident when it comes to men since you know how not to hurt them during sex.\u0026rdquo; Her mood suddenly lightened, and Miu wondered why she had been so anxious just moments before. She turned around to the men and smiled. \u0026ldquo;Still wondering if you should take one of these guys?\u0026rdquo; Susan asked again. \u0026ldquo;Actually I\u0026rsquo;m wondering if we shouldn’t take all of them,\u0026rdquo; was Miu\u0026rsquo;s answer. \u0026ldquo;Those five are the best this club has to offer today, and I doubt one would suffice for any of us.\u0026rdquo; With a naughty smile Susan nodded. As the Asian woman stepped towards the group of men, Susan fell back as she was still feeling the aftermath of her \u0026ldquo;assistance\u0026rdquo;. Ever since she had figured that she possessed mind control powers, she had also noticed the slight pain in her head whenever she used it. This pain had grown quite big when she had turned \u0026ldquo;Blue-Eyes\u0026rdquo; into her slave. Susan had figured that this had something to do with him being super as well, and thus capable of resistance. Back at the lab there hadn\u0026rsquo;t been any pain at all, but Susan had to admit her lack of attention back then. The total submission of Blue-Eyes had been enough of a struggle for Susan to not attempt a similar thing with Miu. It was much easier to have the fellow super girl assisting of her own volition. That being said, lifting that mental block from the Asian had been quite the struggle for Susan, apparently Miu\u0026rsquo;s resistance was growing each time Susan would overwrite her opinion. After a few seconds, her headache was gone however, and Susan could focus her attention on watching the outcome.\nDeziree felt like she had barely fallen asleep when a sudden noise woke her. The first thing she felt was confusion. Confusion about her whereabouts, the noise that had woken her, and the strange \u0026ndash; yet somehow familiar feeling \u0026ndash; of something warm in her embrace. The noise, she quickly recognized as someone\u0026rsquo;s mobile phone ringing, and when she heard a voice right next to her calling out, \u0026ldquo;Not now!\u0026rdquo; the mystery was solved. Then, the memories came back to her. Her drinking the milk she had snuck out of the lab, transforming into a goddess of a woman and, through a strange string of events, landing in bed with Jacob Spencer, a man she had first met only this afternoon. Once the phone had finally stopped ringing, Deziree could feel his hand softly caressing her back, causing her to moan in surprise. \u0026ldquo;Hm, you even sound different now that you\u0026rsquo;re back to normal,\u0026rdquo; he commented. Deziree\u0026rsquo;s face turned beet red at this comment and she thanked god for the darkness right now. He was right. Whatever power - and looks - she had before was now gone, only for plain old her to remain. \u0026ldquo;Uhm\u0026hellip; yeah,\u0026rdquo; she muttered, feeling self-conscious right now. After all, her normal self didn\u0026rsquo;t have much going for her in terms of looks. \u0026ldquo;Everything alright?\u0026rdquo; he seemed to sense her insecurity. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine,\u0026rdquo; she lied. \u0026ldquo;Really? You sound upset.\u0026rdquo; By now he sounded fully awake. \u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s just\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she struggled for words. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re afraid that I\u0026rsquo;ll be disappointed by seeing your normal form naked?\u0026rdquo; Deziree blushed even further if that was possible. \u0026ldquo;Y-yes.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry,\u0026rdquo; his hand now caressed her hair. \u0026ldquo;I was still awake when you turned back and there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed of.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;But\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; He sighed. \u0026ldquo;Look at it this way: You\u0026rsquo;re an astonishing woman who was able to think clearly and react quickly in a situation that would\u0026rsquo;ve freaked out most people.\u0026rdquo; He was referencing to her decision of sealing the plant and the super potion this afternoon. \u0026ldquo;If I remember correctly my plan failed.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;And even then you made the best of it. Look, I\u0026rsquo;m just trying to say I asked that woman out, not the larger-than-life goddess you turned yourself into afterwards.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Aww, you\u0026rsquo;re too kind.\u0026rdquo; Deziree leaned in to kiss him. \u0026ldquo;But you didn\u0026rsquo;t seem too opposed to that goddess, either.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Since it was you, how could a mere man like me resist?\u0026rdquo; he joked before kissing her again. \u0026ldquo;Hm, you know I still have more of that stuff here\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Deziree felt herself getting more and more aroused. \u0026ldquo;E-even some that would work on you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s save that for later,\u0026rdquo; he whispered into her ear. \u0026ldquo;Right now I want to make love to the real you.\u0026rdquo; Deziree tried to resist, still struggling with the fact that she was normal \u0026ndash; and tired \u0026ndash; right now. One kiss later though, she felt tiredness being washed away by the rising passion inside her. Her body was suddenly providing reserves she hadn\u0026rsquo;t known to be there. Before she knew it, she had fully joined in.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on, push harder!\u0026rdquo; Michelle cheered. \u0026ldquo;What do you think I\u0026rsquo;m trying to do here,\u0026rdquo; James answered. But it was of no use. The pain in his cells eventually overwhelmed him, causing him to even stop trying in order to take a short break as he landed back on the ground. Not too long ago he had doubted that a superhuman could even feel pain, but now he knew from experience that overexertion had the same effect on him with powers as it would have without. The only difference was the point at which his body reached the limit. \u0026ldquo;What happened to being 20% stronger than me?\u0026rdquo; Michelle teased, descending but not touching down on the ground. \u0026ldquo;That only applied to physical strength,\u0026rdquo; he replied. In between their lovemaking, Michelle and James had taken short breaks in which they tested out the limits of their powers. Apparently his personal power was to determine the right numbers with no measuring equipment whatsoever, from the speed with which they had traveled to the remote island, to the weight of anything they found here. Since they had exchanged their super energy before that, this power was no longer exclusive to him, either, and he now had the same extra powers Michelle had accumulated over time. Compared to heat vision, mind control or Michelle\u0026rsquo;s mind melding, him being good with numbers sounded like the nerdiest superpower ever. But still, it had its use in determining what they could and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do. One of these discoveries had been the amount they could lift, and the result had been a short boost of James' ego. He could lift a bit more than 300 tons in his current form, whereas Michelle\u0026rsquo;s limit was about 250 tons \u0026ndash; leaving him with the aforementioned advantage of 20%. Personally, James preferred the absolute numbers. 50 tons simply sounded better than being 20% stronger. And that was as far as the ego boost went here. James was aware that the strength difference was about 50% between the average woman and the average man. This difference had decreased significantly when both were super. Moreover, with Michelle having been rather weak as a human and him in rather good shape, the loss of a strength advantage may have been even higher. Their current test, however, had made it obvious that his advantage in physical strength wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth as much as he\u0026rsquo;d have liked it to be. After all, in order to apply this level of strength, one needed an equal footing. If Michelle\u0026rsquo;s fight with Susan Harland had proven anything, then it was that this footing wasn\u0026rsquo;t found in the floors and walls of buildings, but in their very own flight powers. And on this front, James knew he had no chance of coming out on top. Michelle\u0026rsquo;s stunt with the plane had significantly increased her capabilities there, being able to lift about 100 tons and still being airborne, while James barely managed half as much. This had led to the point where Michelle wanted to train James in order for him to catch up. The exercise seemed simple enough. Michelle would anchor herself in the air while James would have to push with all his might to move her. \u0026ldquo;Still, you should be able to move me at least a tiny bit,\u0026rdquo; Michelle summed up the situation. \u0026ldquo;I mean I can feel that you\u0026rsquo;re getting better at this, but it feels a bit slow.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah, it does,\u0026rdquo; James had to agree as his body recovered from the strain. \u0026ldquo;Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because you had more super energy at your disposal as you went through this? We\u0026rsquo;re about to run low, after all.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Maybe,\u0026rdquo; Michelle exclaimed, sounding disappointed. \u0026ldquo;I just wished we could\u0026rsquo;ve done more\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; James raised his brow. \u0026ldquo;More than this?\u0026rdquo; He looked around the small island that was barely recognizable as the tiny paradise they had found here a few hours ago. The combination of superpowered lovemaking and testing their power in between made it resemble a battlefield. \u0026ldquo;Uhm, yeah,\u0026rdquo; she blushed as she as well became aware of that destruction. She then hovered into his arms. \u0026ldquo;It was such a nice night. But I guess even the best nights have to end eventually.\u0026rdquo; That sounded odd, given that the sun had risen a few hours ago on the island. Thankfully, that was caused by the time difference, and it would still be early morning at home. \u0026ldquo;We can come back here tomorrow night and continue with a bigger energy supply.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hm,\u0026rdquo; she leaned in for a kiss that made him airborne again. \u0026ldquo;I would like that.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;But first we\u0026rsquo;ll need to get to our work day. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll have some interesting news for you after that.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; she smiled back as they left the island. \u0026ldquo;With other supers willing to help you with your research things should go quickly,\u0026rdquo; she mused. \u0026ldquo;And hopefully you won\u0026rsquo;t have any unpleasant surprises today.\u0026rdquo;\nMiu opened her eyes to the first rays of light. It took her the fraction of a second to remember where she was and how she had gotten here. The Asian goddess smiled as she looked around to find Brad, Tony and Jonas sprawled all around her. They were all sleeping soundly. Miu giggled as she took the only way out that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t disturb their sleep \u0026ndash; hovering above them. Of course these guys were exhausted. After all, they had spent the last few hours giving their all to please her \u0026ndash; and boy, had they succeeded. Miu blushed as she touched down on the floor, her naked body still brimming with energy, while her three lovers were taking a well-deserved nap. The room they were in belonged to a large estate owned by Jonas. It had been quite luxurious in its design, showing that their host had more going for him than just his good looks. Right now, however, the room was a mess. Miu had been quite the wild lover, and more than once her super strength had proven fatal to the furniture. She looked at a marble globe, easily three or four feet in diameter, that had probably been quite expensive. It had been shattered when one of her orgasms made her throw her head back with too much force. Miu absentmindedly ran her hands through her long black mane and removed a few bits of marble that hat been stuck there since then. Despite the destructive effect she had on the furniture, Miu had somehow prevented herself from hurting her lovers. Those three may be tired beyond imagination, but they hadn\u0026rsquo;t received a single scratch. \u0026ldquo;Guess none of you is in the mood for breakfast yet,\u0026rdquo; she giggled as she materialized herself a basic outfit consisting of a tank top and short workout pants. With her modesty being taken care of she stepped \u0026ndash; no, danced \u0026ndash; out of the room. The estate was bigger than she had remembered, probably because she hadn\u0026rsquo;t cared about that. Still the entrance hall was quite something with a long, winding stairway and a big chandelier in the middle. Miu took the opportunity to fly upwards to take a close look at the chandelier, only to note that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t made of solid gold, but rather had a small layer of it for looks sake. Nevertheless their host was loaded, but then again, they had asked the guys about who had the biggest place and come here because of that. Once again landing on the floor, Miu made her way to the kitchen. \u0026ldquo;Good morning, sunshine,\u0026rdquo; Susan laughed as Miu entered. She was sitting at the table, a mug of hot cocoa in her hands, wearing a fancy morning robe that she had must\u0026rsquo;ve gotten from somewhere in the house. Sitting next to her at the table was another woman, with strawberry blonde hair, a killer figure and the signature glow of super energy right underneath her skin. This glow was a lot less intense than the one coming from Susan or herself, indicating that her supply of super energy was a lower than theirs. This was only natural as Miu herself didn\u0026rsquo;t have much more power her first time around either. She looked at Miu, grinning as she realized that the Asian supergirl was checking her out. \u0026ldquo;Looks like someone had a makeover. You look good Sandy,\u0026rdquo; Miu exclaimed, thankful that she remembered the other woman\u0026rsquo;s name. They had picked her up last night so that Blue-Eyes could have some fun as well. And obviously, he had turned her into a superhuman just like he had Miu and Susan before. \u0026ldquo;Thanks,\u0026rdquo; the other woman proudly answered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m still getting used to it, but Susan has been so kind to fill me in on things.\u0026rdquo; She hugged the blonde fellow goddess as if she was her best friend, not some random stranger that had picked her up last night just because. \u0026ldquo;Aww, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that much, Sandy!\u0026rdquo; Susan joked before returning her focus on Miu again. \u0026ldquo;So am I right to assume you had some fun?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You most definitely are,\u0026rdquo; Miu said as she took a seat on the kitchen table as well. She noticed that Blue-Eyes was there as well, occupied with preparing the breakfast. Something about this behavior felt strange to Miu. When they had talked yesterday, he hadn\u0026rsquo;t seemed like the kind of guy who\u0026rsquo;d do that. But then again she didn\u0026rsquo;t know him that well. \u0026ldquo;Oh yeah,\u0026rdquo; Sandy added. \u0026ldquo;You definitely sounded like you had more than a bit fun.\u0026rdquo; Miu blushed. \u0026ldquo;W-was I that loud?\u0026rdquo; Both Susan and Sandy nodded in unison. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed of,\u0026rdquo; Susan exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;I think we all had our share tonight.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re just jealous that she had three guys all for herself,\u0026rdquo; Sandy giggled. \u0026ldquo;I would\u0026rsquo;ve had four if a certain someone hadn\u0026rsquo;t teleported herself right into the middle of it!\u0026rdquo; Susan countered. \u0026ldquo;You were greedy and I was needy,\u0026rdquo; Sandy stuck out her tongue only for Susan to roll her eyes. Apparently she wasn\u0026rsquo;t as mad about that as she pretended. \u0026ldquo;Wait a second\u0026hellip; teleported?\u0026rdquo; Miu interrupted. \u0026ldquo;Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s kinda\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Sandy began only to disappear from her place. \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;My thing,\u0026rdquo; came her voice from right behind Miu\u0026rsquo;s right ear. Startled by the sudden voice, Miu lashed out, her hand finding Sandy\u0026rsquo;s face. A split second later the kitchen cabinet behind Sandy was crushed as the latter crashed into it. \u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; Miu shouted as she realized that she had slapped the other woman with way too much force. \u0026ldquo;Are you hurt?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t feel a thing,\u0026rdquo; came the answer from a surprised Sandy, who simply disappeared from the rubble and reappeared on her seat. \u0026ldquo;This invulnerability bit is really awesome.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The accidental use of super strength, not so much,\u0026rdquo; Miu commented. \u0026ldquo;But I get that teleporting bit now.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re just easy to scare that\u0026rsquo;s all,\u0026rdquo; Susan commented. \u0026ldquo;But you should\u0026rsquo;ve seen the guys' faces when she did that last night.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I guess they were just as scared at first as I was, just less\u0026hellip; forceful.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;At first, yeah. Didn\u0026rsquo;t help that she suddenly appeared right when we were at it. Then again, there suddenly was a second supergirl for them to please, so of course they liked it.\u0026rdquo; Susan explained. \u0026ldquo;I can imagine that,\u0026rdquo; Miu answered. Blue-Eyes was now delivering the first round of waffles and the girls quickly dug in. Once she took the first bite, Miu realized two things: First, her sense of taste had been amplified along with the rest of her body. She had suspected this already yesterday in the club with the drinks there, but hadn\u0026rsquo;t tried it with actual food. Second, Blue-Eyes’ cooking skills were mediocre at best. She looked around and noticed both Sandy and Susan having a surprised look on their faces as well. Apparently they were making the same kind of discovery right now. \u0026ldquo;So, what are your plans for today?\u0026rdquo; Susan asked around. \u0026ldquo;Hm?\u0026rdquo; Sandy seemed caught off-guard with this question. \u0026ldquo;Well I\u0026rsquo;ve got lectures later, but until then I\u0026rsquo;m free.\u0026rdquo; She then looked at Miu. \u0026ldquo;How about you?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Well, I kinda planned to visit this lab where they researched the meteor aftermath. The scientist I met yesterday seemed quite knowledgeable about what\u0026rsquo;s been going on with us. Maybe you should join in? The more the merrier.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think it would be a good idea for me to go there,\u0026rdquo; Susan answered. \u0026ldquo;Why not? You\u0026rsquo;re just as curious about it than I am,\u0026rdquo; Miu pushed. \u0026ldquo;That may be true, but for me that\u0026rsquo;s not an option,\u0026rdquo; Susan sighed. \u0026ldquo;My last trip there didn\u0026rsquo;t exactly go well, and I doubt they would be as helpful to me as they would be to you.\u0026rdquo; Miu remembered James' comment about the \u0026lsquo;argument\u0026rsquo; of the last two superwomen at the lab. \u0026ldquo;So, how should we proceed?\u0026rdquo; Susan leaned back, obviously thinking for a second. \u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; how about you go there, talk to that cute scientist you mentioned, and get whatever information they have to offer. You just leave out any part about what happened last night, like meeting Blue-Eyes and me.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What about me? Should I accompany her?\u0026rdquo; Sandy asked. \u0026ldquo;That whole thing sounds really interesting.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think that’s a good idea,\u0026rdquo; Susan interrupted. \u0026ldquo;They already know Miu, but when they last saw her, she didn\u0026rsquo;t have powers or the ability to create other supers. So it would be strange for her to bring another one.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I did find Devil in that bar, too. And besides, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to hide the fact that I found a power source the way I am now, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;d have to transform back to normal to pull that off, obviously.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Miu almost shouted. \u0026ldquo;G-give all this up?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s only temporary, of course. You\u0026rsquo;ll turn back to normal, go to the lab and help them with their research. They do have some of that super stuff there, so maybe they\u0026rsquo;d even give you some as part of the tests. If not, that Devil woman will be there too, right? She might share some of hers with you as well. And if that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work out, you can still ask Blue-Eyes to power you up once you\u0026rsquo;re back.\u0026rdquo; Susan gave Blue-Eyes a stern look to which the latter quickly replied, \u0026ldquo;Yes, sure; I\u0026rsquo;d power you up anytime!\u0026rdquo; Miu pondered the idea. Susan had a point there, but at the same time she was nervous about giving her new abilities up even for a bit. It simply felt too good. She looked at Blue-Eyes and confirmed that he had already recovered some of the super energy he had given to the three of them. Especially since the sun hadn\u0026rsquo;t been up for that long. Would she be able to recover that quickly eventually? \u0026ldquo;Alright, I\u0026rsquo;ll do it.\u0026rdquo; After seeing Susan smile, she added. \u0026ldquo;What are you going to do?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Me? I\u0026rsquo;ll do my own research of course.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You seem nervous,\u0026rdquo; Jacob exclaimed as his car was finally getting back into view. He was lucky that Deziree\u0026rsquo;s place wasn\u0026rsquo;t too far from his and, rather than having her take the bus to work, he insisted on driving her. After all, his job would lead him exactly there anyway. \u0026ldquo;Well, I had some kind of super makeover last night, and for once don\u0026rsquo;t want my colleagues to notice that!\u0026rdquo; came the answer. \u0026ldquo;You look great,\u0026rdquo; he assured her. \u0026ldquo;And that\u0026rsquo;s the problem,\u0026rdquo; she sighed, rolling her eyes. \u0026ldquo;Guess it\u0026rsquo;s my own fault. I should have considered that I\u0026rsquo;d still look different from before after going through such a life-changing event.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The difference isn\u0026rsquo;t too big, I doubt anybody who didn\u0026rsquo;t pay attention to you before would notice that.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Do you notice it?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yes; your skin is smoother, your hair is silkier, and all the bruises are gone. Fortunately, I was one of only few people who even knew about the last.\u0026rdquo; Jacob knew that he\u0026rsquo;d better explain himself right away or Deziree would freak out even more. \u0026ldquo;Look, there\u0026rsquo;s probably a lot of women who were in the same situation as you right now and nobody has ever been reported to the police because they looked good.\u0026rdquo; She looked like she wanted to protest, but decided against it. \u0026ldquo;I guess you\u0026rsquo;re right. But what about someone like Dr. Thompson? He\u0026rsquo;ll probably figure it out if I run into him.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;That won\u0026rsquo;t be a problem as long as he doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell anybody else, right? I doubt he\u0026rsquo;d sell you out if we tell him right away. And it\u0026rsquo;ll be easier to figure things out if you cooperate.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;He didn\u0026rsquo;t seem too interested yesterday. Whatever issues he had with his girlfriend yesterday, he’d better sort them out ASAP.\u0026rdquo; Jacob was about to answer when his phone suddenly rang. Come to think of it, he had ignored it earlier, so he picked it up. \u0026ldquo;Spencer,\u0026rdquo; he said with a smile. Deziree watched him as this smile faded, replaced by concern. \u0026ldquo;She what? That should\u0026rsquo;ve been impossible. Okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll keep my eyes open.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Something the matter?\u0026rdquo; Deziree asked once he hung up. \u0026ldquo;Ms. Harland broke out of prison.\u0026rdquo; Memories of yesterday flashed through her head. \u0026ldquo;H-how?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Apparently she ripped a hole into the wall and flew out into the night.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;That’s\u0026hellip; impossible! She was depowered!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The surveillance feed shows that she was talking to someone before leaving. Unfortunately that other person can\u0026rsquo;t be seen. Whoever that was must\u0026rsquo;ve been super too, making finding her tricky.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;As long as she doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to find us again\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Deziree said absentmindedly. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it. I don\u0026rsquo;t think she\u0026rsquo;s that much after you, or any of us, to risk being defeated again.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yes, but it was also by pure chance that the Angel showed up when she did,\u0026rdquo; Deziree retorted. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s one thing that has been bugging me,\u0026rdquo; Jacob thought aloud. \u0026ldquo;Her appearance was quite convenient after all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re late!\u0026rdquo; Debbie exclaimed as Michelle entered the car. \u0026ldquo;Did you bring everything?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; Michelle answered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got my workout clothes right here,\u0026rdquo; she held out her bag before she threw it on the backseat. \u0026ldquo;Now could you explain why I had to bring these?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Duh, we\u0026rsquo;re going to the gym, of course!\u0026rdquo; was all Debbie answered. \u0026ldquo;Good thing we\u0026rsquo;re not going to a wedding reception with these,\u0026rdquo; Michelle exclaimed as she rolled her eyes. The sarcasm seemed to work. \u0026ldquo;Okay, look at it from this angle: If you suddenly had super powers, where would you go?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Probably somewhere private,\u0026rdquo; came Michelle\u0026rsquo;s answer. After all, that was how she had done it. \u0026ldquo;And once you figured out that you are faster and stronger than any human, what would you do?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Obviously not work out in a gym that has no weights fit for this kind of power!\u0026rdquo; Michelle exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;After all we\u0026rsquo;re talking about lifting-a-plane-strong.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yes, a gym wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be good for an actual workout, but there\u0026rsquo;s more to that,\u0026rdquo; Debbie began. \u0026ldquo;A gym is perfect to show off these powers.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;From what I can tell the Angel isn\u0026rsquo;t much of a show-off, or else she would seek the next best camera, right?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The Angel may not be like this, but other people in the same situation might be. My gut tells me it\u0026rsquo;s worth a shot. The chances may be slim, but that\u0026rsquo;s still better than running around with no further plan.\u0026rdquo; Michelle had to admit that this made some sense. This was mostly because there were indeed other supers out there, and judging by the number of them James had encountered in a bar yesterday, the number was growing quicker than expected.\n\u0026ldquo;This is getting boring!\u0026rdquo; Sandy exclaimed after she missed Susan for the tenth time in a row. The two superwomen had been playing a game of tag that involved teleportation. Susan had suggested it after Sandy had given her a bit of her super energy \u0026ndash; and the ability to teleport along with it. And the reason was plain and simple: to exercise this new power. After a while Susan had found out the rules behind teleportation. In short, she was able to switch places with any non-organic matter that was where she wanted to be. For most of the time this meant air, but they had also tested out what happened when something was in the way. Susan had burst into laughter as Sandy had teleported underground, leaving a Sandy-shaped figure in her place that quickly collapsed into a pile of earth and dirt that it was composed of. Organic matter, however seemed to block the teleportation in most cases. I was impossible for Sandy to teleport into a tree - not even partially - probably because that would have destroyed said tree. The same rule applied to animals - at least the bigger ones. When Sandy had teleported underground, she had unwittingly teleported a bunch of bugs and worms in the earth she had switched places with above ground. So Susan had concluded that it was impossible to hurt anybody with this particular power. Sandy\u0026rsquo;s frustration however, wasn\u0026rsquo;t based on these discoveries. The game of tag they had been playing had started out with her in the lead, but Susan had soon caught up and was now outmatching her \u0026ndash; the very person who had developed this teleportation power in the first place. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not concentrating enough,\u0026rdquo; Susan exclaimed, dodging Sandy\u0026rsquo;s attempt to tag her by teleporting out of the way in the last moment. Sandy quickly found Susan\u0026rsquo;s new position and tried to teleport herself behind the blonde, only to grab thin air once again. \u0026ldquo;How is it that you know exactly where I am?\u0026rdquo; she finally asked. \u0026ldquo;Well, we\u0026rsquo;ve got more than one superpower,\u0026rdquo; Susan teased as she closed her eyes, teasing the fellow ubergirl to try again. She could sense the hesitation in the other woman, her hovering in place before suddenly disappearing for another attempt. Susan wasted no time and teleported out of the way leaving Sandy to grab thin air again. Sandy remained in place. Instead of getting frantic, she had decided to calm down and think. Susan was tempted to open her eyes to see what exactly the other woman did, but she kept them closed. Instead, she focused solely on the tracking ability she had gained from Miu. Now Sandy teleported again, appearing just left of Susan, who just barely teleported away again \u0026ndash; only to feel Sandy tap her shoulder right away. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re it,\u0026rdquo; the other woman said. Susan gave her a wicked smile \u0026ndash; a smile the other woman couldn\u0026rsquo;t see because she had closed her eyes like Susan had. Before leaving, Miu had given almost all of her super energy to Sandy, leaving her with the same tracking ability. And now Sandy had finally begun to use it, catching up to Susan once again. Their game continued for about half an hour, after which neither of them made any noticeable progress anymore. That was only half the reason they stopped, however. Both Susan and Sandy had quickly learned that this constant teleporting burned through their energy supply quite fast. So Susan decided to do something less energy-consuming next. Both she and Sandy returned to the villa they had spent the night in. The men - were still out cold, with the sole exception of Blue-Eyes, so the women settled down next to the pool. \u0026ldquo;Now that\u0026rsquo;s more like it,\u0026rdquo; Sandy exclaimed as she lay down, turning the clothes she had created into a very revealing bikini. Susan did the same, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t really thinking about lazing around. She had noticed how quickly Blue-Eyes was recovering his super energy. Knowing that it was created through the absorption of sunlight, Susan had told him to sunbathe while they were out. It had clearly paid off so far, with him being almost full himself already, so he would soon start charging up that plant inside him. The girls hadn\u0026rsquo;t this level of regeneration yet, but Susan wondered if she could speed things up. She concentrated on the sunlight on her skin and soon noticed that the warmth of these rays was accompanied by another sensation. Yes, her body was recovering the super energy. For the next half hour Susan tried to somehow affect this process. Unfortunately she could neither slow it down nor speed it up. After some time, she became frustrated. She opened her eyes again. Next to her, Sandy had already become bored and was trying to balance a huge stone on her finger. She was pretty close to succeeding as well. Her energy regeneration however was the same as Susan’s - except that she used up a bit more right now. On the other side of the pool,? Blue-Eyes seemed to have dozed off, but the fact that he was sleeping didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to affect the speed with which he regenerated the super energy either. Susan bit her lips. So far only time seemed to work when it came to regenerating super energy. Closing her eyes again, Susan recapitulated the last 24 hours. Her fight with the Angel had shown her that knowledge over these powers was a lot more important than the raw energy that allowed them to use it. After all, the Angel had less than half her capacity when their fight started and she had beaten Susan despite the latter maxing-out during the fight. Of course there were also positive effects to consider here. The fact that she had mode-locked herself in this killer body for example was a good thing for her. Not to mention the increased control over her strength she had acquired during the fight. There was also the awareness of her very own special power: mind control. She had to smile as she thought about that. Both Blue-Eyes and Sandy were only in her presence because Susan had tampered with their minds. Blue-Eyes was now her loyal servant, although he seemed to have lost quite a bit of his personality along the way, an unfortunate side-effect of having tried to resist her brainwashing. As for Sandy, Susan had made the necessary arrangements before the latter gained super powers. The outcome was nice, to say the least. Sandy now viewed Susan as her BFF, while she still had her own personality fully intact. Susan had feared the other woman might break out of this control after becoming super, but apparently this hadn\u0026rsquo;t affected her. When asked to share some of her energy so that Susan could use her personal power as well, Sandy hadn\u0026rsquo;t even considered asking for Susan to return the favor. The whole thing about these personal powers seemed strange. They weren\u0026rsquo;t really special if they could be shared as easily, but they sure were helpful. She wondered how many different abilities actually existed. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t like there were hundreds of supers out there for her to make a better picture of it. And the ones that were out there were depowered and couldn\u0026rsquo;t be tracked down with Miu\u0026rsquo;s ability since Susan had never met them. They had only met Blue-Eyes after all, when he had turned them super just like Miu, herself and Sandy. Susan opened her eyes as she put two and two together. In one swift moment her body lifted off the lounger and flew over to Blue-Eyes. \u0026ldquo;Hey! Wake up,\u0026rdquo; she commanded. \u0026ldquo;Hm?\u0026rdquo; he asked, apparently not as deeply asleep as she had expected. \u0026ldquo;What do you want, mistress?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You tracked me down yesterday in order to get my personal power, right?\u0026rdquo; He nodded. \u0026ldquo;You can also track down any of the women you turned super before, right?\u0026rdquo; Another nod. \u0026ldquo;Good!\u0026rdquo; Susan exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like to meet them!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now that\u0026rsquo;s a big hole,\u0026rdquo; one of the scientists exclaimed as he saw the shredded vault door. \u0026ldquo;What kind of animal could have done this?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What makes you think it was an animal that did it?\u0026rdquo; another one asked. \u0026ldquo;Because of the claw-marks, of course.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;If those were claws at all,\u0026rdquo; James interrupted the discussion by stepping closer to these marks. Putting his fingers into it, he noticed that they were just a bit too wide to fit in, but the size was close enough. \u0026ldquo;I can almost put my fingers inside these marks, so I think it\u0026rsquo;s save to assume that it weren\u0026rsquo;t claws, but fingers that did it. I\u0026rsquo;d say that this is probably the work of a superpowered woman.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Which is pretty obvious actually. Why did you even consider an animal?\u0026rdquo; the second scientist teased. The first one didn\u0026rsquo;t find any words to answer this. \u0026ldquo;Maybe because whatever can give a woman the ability to lift a plane or rip this door apart can probably do something similar to an animal,\u0026rdquo; came the voice of Deziree Archer. James turned around to look at the woman and immediately noticed the slight changes in appearance she had compared when they had first met yesterday. Back then James hadn\u0026rsquo;t paid too much attention, and fortunately neither had any of their colleagues. Even more fortunate was the fact that he was also the only one that knew that she was thrown around the hall, and thus should have been bruised at the very least. Those wounds were gone, along with quite a few other imperfections on her appearance. Of course, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t the supernatural woman going by the less-than-creative name Desire anymore, but for those who knew the rules, it was pretty obvious that she had been. Of course, James could understand that she didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to rub this aspect into anybody\u0026rsquo;s face. Especially not considering that she was the one who had ripped open the vault door and stole what had been stored in there. The way she looked at him made it clear that she was afraid that he had figured it out. Fortunately he had no idea to sell her out like this. \u0026ldquo;Dr. Archer,\u0026rdquo; said Prof. Smith, their superior. \u0026ldquo;Was there anything in there besides the containers you sealed away?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Not that I know of.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Anybody else?\u0026rdquo; he asked around, only to be met with shaking heads. Apparently none of the other scientists had deemed anything dangerous enough to be stored there. \u0026ldquo;I see. Do you have any idea why someone would want to do that?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Actually I have,\u0026rdquo; Deziree began. \u0026ldquo;The plant’s genetic makeup seems identical to the changes undergone by Jane Doe and Mrs. Riley. I assume that this may be the cause of the mutation \u0026ndash; and probably the super powers, too.\u0026rdquo; She also added a brief explanation of her encounter with Ms. Harland where the latter actually drank a good amount of a third container. \u0026ldquo;The Angel took what\u0026rsquo;s left of the third container with her,\u0026rdquo; she concluded. \u0026ldquo;Hm, that indeed makes it pretty likely that the liquid was responsible. We should verify this ASAP. Do we still have some of that stuff here? \u0026ldquo;The plant is here and it still produces the liquid,\u0026rdquo; Deziree assured him. \u0026ldquo;Good, make sure to compare it with the mutated women. We need a verification as soon as possible. Given the issues with Ms. Harland, I think it would be better for you to refer to Dr. Thompson for that.\u0026rdquo; James was a bit surprised by this decision, but in hindsight he should\u0026rsquo;ve seen it coming. Cooperating with Deziree would be the best way to get more insight on the plant. The downside was that it was only a matter of time until she found out that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only one who had taken a sip of that liquid here. Well, he was sure that she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t sell him out. The distinct sound of his own phone broke this train of thoughts. \u0026ldquo;Dr. Thompson? You\u0026hellip; uhm\u0026hellip; have a visitor,\u0026rdquo; was all the unfamiliar woman said. Hearing the nervousness in her voice left little doubt who that visitor was.\n\u0026ldquo;You must\u0026rsquo;ve been working out!\u0026rdquo; Debbie exclaimed after their warm-up. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t even sweat one bit.\u0026rdquo; Michelle bit her lip. They had only done a slight warm-up, but Debbie had already noticed this particular aspect of her body. Her body would only produce sweat for one reason: pheromones. Fortunately, Debbie had been out of town for years, otherwise she would have wondered a lot more about the improvement in her appearance. This way, she assumed that Michelle had been hitting the gym for some time and in better shape because of that. But this would only work for a time. The two women had no real intention of a workout, but they had to play along in order to blend in. For Michelle, blending in was an even bigger challenge, though. Not only wouldn\u0026rsquo;t her body perspire regardless of the strain, Michelle also felt the urge to\u0026hellip; do more. These few minutes on the treadmill had found her wanting to sprint with full force, to see how fast she could go. Would she be able to run Olympic-level speed, even without any super energy in her body? This question had gone through her head the whole time, and all she would have to do was try it out. But with Debbie right next to her, this would be a mistake. After all, this was why they were here. \u0026ldquo;Have you noticed anybody suspicious?\u0026rdquo; Michelle cut to the chase. \u0026ldquo;Not really,\u0026rdquo; came the answer. \u0026ldquo;But this is just the warm-up and cardio area. Not exactly the place where you show off enhanced strength.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t see anybody who looks enhanced either,\u0026rdquo; Michelle commented, happy that Debbie hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed her endurance here. \u0026ldquo;Hm, you think the Angel\u0026rsquo;s appearance is part of her powers too?\u0026rdquo; Debbie asked. \u0026ldquo;Uhm, maybe? It is a possibility after all.\u0026rdquo; Michelle countered unsure whether she should stir Debbie into the right direction or not. After all she knew that the appearance was part of the package \u0026ndash; most of the time anyway. It would make it easier for her to fly under the radar if Debbie was looking for outrageously beautiful people, but at the same time it would be suspicious for her to know these details. \u0026ldquo;Well, she was supposed to be outrageously beautiful, but she might\u0026rsquo;ve looked that way from the start.\u0026rdquo; Apparently Debbie wasn\u0026rsquo;t easily convinced. \u0026ldquo;I think it might be safer to keep our eyes open for any suspicious display of strength and not focus on appearance.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;If you say so,\u0026rdquo; Michelle exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;I think we better split up for that.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah, this way we cover more ground,\u0026rdquo; Debbie said, picking up her towel before walking away. Michelle was glad that her colleague was seeing things this way. She didn\u0026rsquo;t really expect them to run into another super here, at least not with the level of power Debbie was expecting. But at the same time, Michelle felt a certain curiosity about her current level of strength. Sure she wasn\u0026rsquo;t capable of lifting several tons right now, but if the ease with which she had warmed up was any indication then she\u0026rsquo;d still be stronger than she looked.\nAmanda looked around the lobby impatiently. It was bigger than she had anticipated, but the real problem was the people. She felt the stares of dozens of people on her and realized that she didn\u0026rsquo;t really like being the center of attention. Then again, it was her own fault. She was super right now, and unlike at the bar yesterday, she had not gone for a normal outfit, but her self-made costume. The black costume with the red flames on it wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly encouraging others to think of her as a nice girl \u0026ndash; and the name Devil didn\u0026rsquo;t help either. Truth was that she was just as nervous as the ones around her. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;ll be here in a few minutes,\u0026rdquo; the receptionist said weakly. Amanda could practically smell the fear. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s okay, I\u0026rsquo;ve got time.\u0026rdquo; Amanda answered with a smile. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly true, however. She may have taken the day off, but the main reason was that Fred would be released from the hospital today. But this woman didn\u0026rsquo;t know that. \u0026ldquo;Uhm\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; the woman began, \u0026ldquo;Is it true that you can, you know\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she blushed as she began fiddling around with her fingers. \u0026ldquo;I can do what?\u0026rdquo; Amanda asked, trying to sound as friendly as possible in order to break the ice. The woman was still fiddling, but eventually gathered the courage to ask. \u0026ldquo;C-can you really fly?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You mean like this?\u0026rdquo; Amanda asked as she rose a few inches off the ground. \u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; yelped not only the receptionist but a few of the other gawkers as well. Others made comments like, \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s the real deal,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;She can actually do it.\u0026rdquo; Fearing to be the next one to blush, Amanda touched down on the floor again. \u0026ldquo;Seems like I arrived just in time,\u0026rdquo; a female voice came from behind Amanda. She turned around and spotted Miu, the Asian girl she had encountered yesterday. Miu was wearing a track-suit and a bag, looking like she wanted to go to the gym rather than a lab. But then again, they had been talking about the tests beforehand, which would include physical examination. And given that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t super right now, Miu had to bring her change of clothes the old-fashioned way. \u0026ldquo;Hi\u0026hellip; uhm,\u0026rdquo; Amanda hesitated to call her by name. \u0026ldquo;Miu is just fine. I have no intention of going for a codename or something like that.\u0026rdquo; At this moment, Amanda could hear the faint ring of an elevator arriving, and as it opened, both James and a woman she hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen before emerged from it. \u0026ldquo;This is Dr. Archer,\u0026rdquo; he introduced her. \u0026ldquo;She specializes in botany and will help us with our tests today.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You can call me Deziree,\u0026rdquo; she said. As she shook the woman\u0026rsquo;s hand, Amanda immediately felt that Deziree had been super too, and came to the conclusion that she was Desire, another woman she had encountered yesterday. The real surprise however was when she shook James' hand and learned that he was in the same boat. After last night she hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected him to take the potion this quickly. Apparently Miu noticed both things too, but she kept quiet about it. \u0026ldquo;Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s go down to the lab, shall we?\u0026rdquo;\nThe young woman stared at Susan as if she was seeing a ghost. She was less surprised about the fact that Susan hovered in front of her like it was nothing than the fact that she had been brought here abruptly. Blue-Eyes had tracked her down and teleported her right into the mansion. \u0026ldquo;Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Susan,\u0026rdquo; she introduced herself. \u0026ldquo;J-Jennifer,\u0026rdquo; the other woman stammered in response. \u0026ldquo;Hello Jennifer, do you know why you\u0026rsquo;re here?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; she shook her head. \u0026ldquo;Do you remember the man who brought you here?\u0026rdquo; A sheepish smile appeared on Jennifer\u0026rsquo;s face. \u0026ldquo;Y-yes. I\u0026hellip; met him before.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah, he\u0026rsquo;s good at\u0026hellip; meeting people,\u0026rdquo; Susan leaned in close. \u0026ldquo;And afterwards something happened to you, didn\u0026rsquo;t it? Something that made you\u0026hellip; super.\u0026rdquo; With a gulp, Jennifer nodded. She was staring into Susan\u0026rsquo;s eyes, transfixed by their golden glow that grew in intensity as Susan activated her mind control powers. \u0026ldquo;Tell me, what could you do when you had these powers?\u0026rdquo; Without any powers of her own, Jennifer had no resistance to Susan. \u0026ldquo;I could defy gravity, I was really strong, and could see through walls.\u0026rdquo; Susan frowned at the shortness of the list. Apparently Jennifer hadn\u0026rsquo;t found all the powers in the time she had. This included her individual power, if she even had one. \u0026ldquo;Would you like to have these powers again?\u0026rdquo; Susan asked. Jennifer nodded. \u0026ldquo;W-what do I have to do for that?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Not much, actually. All you have to do is fulfill my every wish.\u0026rdquo; Another nod. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll do that.\u0026rdquo; With a smile, Susan nodded for Blue-Eyes to do his thing. He grabbed her neck and infused her with super energy. Jennifer didn\u0026rsquo;t resist but rather moaned as the super energy caused her body to change into a more suitable shape. In less than ten seconds, she turned from a pretty, yet otherwise average woman, into the same kind of goddess that Susan herself was. Her clothes protested in vain as she grew in size, stretching them to their limit in some places, and beyond these limits in others. Once the transformation was over, Jennifer rose into the air, happy to feel the power again. \u0026ldquo;Wow, I almost forgot how good it felt,\u0026rdquo; she whispered. \u0026ldquo;Yeah, we get that a lot,\u0026rdquo; Susan commented before holding out her hand. \u0026ldquo;And now give me a bit of your super energy!\u0026rdquo; Even without using her mind control powers, Jennifer did as she was told. She took Susan\u0026rsquo;s hand and transferred a small amount of super energy to the other woman. Given Susan\u0026rsquo;s vast reserves, the amount was laughable, but that was all she wanted. Susan smiled at Jennifer\u0026rsquo;s obedience. Apparently the trick to controlling a super lay with the moment of application. Turning her into a slave first and empowering her after that greatly reduced the resistance she experienced. \u0026ldquo;Uhm, do you have a change of clothes that I could borrow?\u0026rdquo; Jennifer\u0026rsquo;s question broke her train of thoughts and reminded her that this kind of mind control didn\u0026rsquo;t turn her into a soulless fool like Blue-Eyes. \u0026ldquo;Unfortunately not. But you can create it yourself if you concentrate; just don\u0026rsquo;t use it too much energy.\u0026rdquo; Jennifer did as she was told and quickly materialized a black leotard that reminded Susan of the one the Angel had worn. She felt the urge to punch the other woman through the next wall for the choice of clothes. \u0026ldquo;I think black isn\u0026rsquo;t really your color,\u0026rdquo; she said instead. Immediately, Jennifer changed the leotard’s color from black to the same pink as Susan\u0026rsquo;s outfit. \u0026ldquo;Much better. Now go outside; the others are waiting at the pool!\u0026rdquo; Just as Jennifer was about to hover out of the room, Susan added. \u0026ldquo;And take your clothes with you!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Of course,\u0026rdquo; Jennifer waved her hand and suddenly the remains of her original outfit lifted off the ground and flew into her waiting hands. \u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t mention before that you could do that,\u0026rdquo; Susan commented. \u0026ldquo;I said I could defy gravity,\u0026rdquo; Jennifer sounded surprised. \u0026ldquo;I thought it was clear that I didn\u0026rsquo;t just mean my own body.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Flight and telekinesis are two different powers, even though they both defy gravity,\u0026rdquo; Susan commented before Jennifer left. The moment she was alone, Susan concentrated on an expensive vase, causing it to lift into the air and then crash into the wall. \u0026ldquo;Thanks for the new power,\u0026rdquo; she whispered before lifting the remains up with her mind and putting them into the next waste bin. Then she turned to Blue-Eyes again. \u0026ldquo;Now fetch me the next one!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Dr. Thompson, could you explain to me why the two of them are here?\u0026rdquo; Deziree asked aloud once the two women were in a separate room. Amanda and Miu were busy running on the treadmill. The first test was about their physical capabilities in unpowered and powered states. \u0026ldquo;Because I invited them,\u0026rdquo; came the answer. \u0026ldquo;And while we\u0026rsquo;re at it, we should stop trying to hide our little secrets from each other.\u0026rdquo; He held out his hand. Deziree looked at him confused and anxious. Still, she took his hand \u0026ndash; and her eyes widened as she realized what he meant. \u0026ldquo;When did you\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo; she whispered. \u0026ldquo;How? Why?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Long after I left the bar. Which was a lot later than when you left. By the way, should I expect Jacob to be in the same state as us?\u0026rdquo; Deziree blushed, yet shook her head. \u0026ldquo;But\u0026hellip; your girlfriend\u0026hellip; oh wait, it\u0026rsquo;s Miu, right?\u0026rdquo; Now it was James turn to blush. \u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s not her. L-let\u0026rsquo;s just say she\u0026rsquo;s fine with it, alright?\u0026rdquo; But Deziree didn\u0026rsquo;t give up that easily. \u0026ldquo;If she\u0026rsquo;s fine with it, she must be super too, right? That would mean it could also be the Angel!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Keep it down, will you?\u0026rdquo; Now Deziree\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened even further. \u0026ldquo;Oh my god, she really is! That\u0026rsquo;s why she showed up yesterday, that strange bond worked like an SOS beacon!\u0026rdquo; Rolling his eyes, James knew he couldn\u0026rsquo;t talk himself out of it anymore. \u0026ldquo;Just keep quiet about it!\u0026rdquo; he hissed before making his way back to the others. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve got some work to do after all.\u0026rdquo; Once arriving in the next room, it only took one look from Amanda for James to realize that their conversation hadn\u0026rsquo;t been as private as he\u0026rsquo;d liked. With her improved hearing she had followed their conversation \u0026ndash; not that there was any news for her there. In fact, the only one still out of the loop was Miu. Both women were still running at the same speed. According to the instruments, Amanda\u0026rsquo;s pulse wasn\u0026rsquo;t even raised despite her running at Olympic level. Miu, on the other hand, did show first signs of strain, but all in all her results were still impressive. After all, she had spent the last two years paralyzed, but right now she could probably pass for a professional runner. \u0026ldquo;Seems like neither of them sweats,\u0026rdquo; Deziree mentioned another interesting bit. \u0026ldquo;H-how long do we have to keep running?\u0026rdquo; Miu panted. \u0026ldquo;I may not look like it, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can keep this up much longer.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Alright, then let’s end this,\u0026rdquo; James suggested. \u0026ldquo;Phew, didn\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;d last that long,\u0026rdquo; exclaimed the Asian woman when she stepped from the treadmill. \u0026ldquo;For the first fifteen minutes you didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be affected at all,\u0026rdquo; Amanda explained as she rose into the air. \u0026ldquo;After that, the lack of super energy in your system became apparent.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Well, we could try again with the roles reversed,\u0026rdquo; Miu joked. \u0026ldquo;Maybe some day we will, but personally I\u0026rsquo;m glad that you can keep up with me like that.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hehe, thanks\u0026hellip; so what’s the next test? Please tell me it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be a direct competition.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Well, actually I do have a competition in mind. Another race actually. But this time, the odds should be more even. Before we do that, however I would like to take the readings of what happens when you power up.\u0026rdquo; A smile appeared on Miu\u0026rsquo;s face.\n\u0026ldquo;And fifty,\u0026rdquo; Michelle whispered as she finished her last repetition. Smiling, she looked around the gym again. She had now completed a full workout on all the machines with their highest weight settings without any special attention. Truth be told, she was surprised that she had managed to complete it. After a while, the strain of using the highest setting had become almost unbearable, but Michelle had pulled through \u0026ndash; and somehow her body had managed to deal with it. Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any stronger now, however. Actually she was quite exhausted, although she could probably continue for a bit. It was a weird feeling. Each time she was done, she felt exhausted, yet her body somehow dug into further reserves on the next machine. And having them on the highest setting meant that she was one of the strongest in the gym. In fact, Michelle was tempted to go over to the weights to see what she could achieve there. She didn\u0026rsquo;t do it because her feats would be that much more obvious with the weights compared to the machines. She had kept her eyes open in case anybody else pulled off something like this, but so far she was the only super in the gym \u0026ndash; and not even Debbie had noticed her little test run. Michelle wondered if she should start over with the first machine when Debbie returned from another part of the gym. \u0026ldquo;Done with your workout?\u0026rdquo; Michelle nodded. \u0026ldquo;Just finished.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Me too. How about we go to the sauna and compare our results?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Hm, sure; that sounds nice.\u0026rdquo; They went back to the locker rooms and took off their clothes. During the whole time, Debbie didn\u0026rsquo;t say a word about whether or not she found anything. In fact, Michelle felt her colleague’s gaze upon her, and became nervous. Had Debbie noticed that she was working out with far bigger weights that her looks implied? Still, she didn\u0026rsquo;t comment on that either, but rather played along. Five minutes later the two women were sitting in the small sauna alone. \u0026ldquo;Alright,\u0026rdquo; Debbie began. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t find anything suspicious. How about you?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Nothing as well.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Well, I guess this was a waste of time then,\u0026rdquo; Debbie concluded as the first beads of sweat began to form on her forehead. \u0026ldquo;Except for a private workout, I mean.\u0026rdquo; Michelle chuckled. \u0026ldquo;You said it yourself, without a solid lead we can do little more than this.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;True, but it\u0026rsquo;s still frustrating. Well, sometimes you just need luck to actually stumble over the big scoop.\u0026rdquo; Debbie laid down on the bench and Michelle did the same. The heat in the sauna felt good. Really good, actually. She could practically feel the exhaustion and strain from her workout leaving her body. Before she knew it, Michelle had closed her eyes. The warmth seeped into her body, like a pleasant massage on a cellular level. It reminded Michelle of the feeling of super energy invading her body when she drank the potion, but this was a lot weaker. Whenever Michelle had taken the potion, the sheer speed had made it almost impossible to actually appreciate the signature feeling when her cells were flooded with the mysterious energy. Right now, the sauna heat provided her with just that feeling. It was so incredibly relaxing; Michelle could clearly feel her body recover. She remembered the fire rescue. Back then her clothes had burned off her body, but she hadn\u0026rsquo;t felt any discomfort but rather a pleasure. Slowly, Michelle realized the similarity. The sauna wasn\u0026rsquo;t as hot as the fire, but apparently her body used it to regenerate the super energy it lacked. Just yesterday this was a very slow process that she only had noticed when she had dedicated her attention to it. But now her body had become a lot quicker to do so, and with the sauna providing a lot of extra heat, the rate increased even further. Michelle however didn\u0026rsquo;t really have a problem with that anymore. Ever since her boyfriend had joined her on this wonderful journey, Michelle was no longer scared of any of these changes. So far everything had developed to her advantage and as she fell asleep, she didn\u0026rsquo;t bother with it in the least, but rather continued to enjoy the ride. And even when the warmth of the sauna was joined with the familiar feeling of weightlessness, she still didn\u0026rsquo;t bother. Had she been awake, she would have, because she wasn\u0026rsquo;t alone in the sauna.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part17/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 17"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"\u0026ldquo;Are you sure you want to do this?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked once more.\nJames rolled his eyes. \u0026ldquo;You know that I gave it some thought, after all you read them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know, it\u0026rsquo;s just that I don\u0026rsquo;t want you to hurry things just because of me!\u0026rdquo; she explained.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t even midnight yet, but they had been lying in bed for some time already. This had been mostly because Michelle had used her powers to let James view some of her memories, and even in her super form this required concentration and stillness. She had used up all of her power during that and, while she hadn\u0026rsquo;t managed to show everything she wanted, she had given him an incredible view on herself. James could finally understand why she had been rushing things earlier when she had asked him to take the potion. If she had read him the way she had allowed him to read her, then it really was like they knew each other for years instead of just days.\n\u0026ldquo;You made sure I’d catch up on the getting-to-know-you part,\u0026rdquo; he simply exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;And that was pretty much my main issue there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about the fact that you are working at a facility looking for people like me?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Remember the colleague of mine that you saved from Ms. Harland today? She knew she\u0026rsquo;d be in the same boat, and that didn\u0026rsquo;t stop her either. So I figured it might be better to give full disclosure, and take full advantage of the resources there. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s much more effective to research the effects of that plant if I don\u0026rsquo;t have to secretly sneak in samples. Not to mention that Ms. Harland might get herself a deal to have herself examined. It would be better to have alternatives to her or at least someone who can keep her in check.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You do have a point there,\u0026rdquo; Michelle said with a smile. Apparently, this was enough to convince her. Actually, James was a bit more surprised that she needed convincing at all. After all, this was what she had been wanting all the time. \u0026ldquo;So\u0026hellip; I do have an overnight bag with me\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nShe didn\u0026rsquo;t need to explain any further. He should have expected that Michelle had another dose of the potion with her when she arrived here. Apparently, she had one more for him as well. He gulped. There was no turning back then. Still, he nodded in approval.\nMichelle pretty much jumped out of the bed, causing James to wonder where she even got the leverage from. The towel she had wrapped around her body fell to the floor, as she pretty much danced to the bag that, until now, had totally escaped James' attention. Even now a part of him was too occupied watching his girlfriend’s naked body to even care. For someone who was supposed to be exhausted after spending her last super energy to maintain their mental link, Michelle sure seemed very lively. Actually, she seemed more toned than he remembered her to be in her mortal form\u0026hellip; or was that just his mind playing tricks on him? He did have a few drinks earlier after all.\n\u0026ldquo;Here,\u0026rdquo; she said as she held out two vials. One of them had a mark resembling a \u0026lsquo;J\u0026rsquo; on it, obviously to make it clear that this one was for him.\n\u0026ldquo;You really put some thought into that one,\u0026rdquo; he commented.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course, it would be disastrous if you drank the wrong one, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo;\nJames couldn\u0026rsquo;t argue with that. Not that he wanted to, anyway. Michelle signaled for him to get up.\n\u0026ldquo;You should get rid of these clothes, too,\u0026rdquo; she commented. \u0026ldquo;You might outgrow them after all.\u0026rdquo;\nOf course he complied, taking stock of her as he did so. She stood there on tip-toe to lessen their size difference. After all, he was a foot taller than her 5'3\u0026quot; while her super form looked eye-to-eye with him - when she wasn\u0026rsquo;t airborne, that is.\n\u0026ldquo;I hope I don\u0026rsquo;t get too much taller,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;If I grow a foot like you, then I\u0026rsquo;d be sticking out way too much.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aww,\u0026rdquo; Michelle kissed him. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about that, you\u0026rsquo;ll be great.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks.\u0026rdquo;\nOnce he was done undressing she gave him the vial. \u0026ldquo;Alright, this is it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Y-you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go first? I thought you would want to watch it happen in full detail.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s true, but wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you want the same?\u0026rdquo; Michelle countered. \u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re going to do that, I think it\u0026rsquo;s only fair for me to take it when you have the super senses to take in every aspect of it, don\u0026rsquo;t you think?\u0026rdquo;\nJames merely kissed her as an answer as he took the potion from her. It was decided then. He opened the vial and brought it to his mouth. With his eyes locked onto hers, he downed the contents.\n\u0026ldquo;Ugh, doesn\u0026rsquo;t taste too good,\u0026rdquo; he commented as he felt his stomach growl. The alien liquid began its work right away, yet the effects he had witnessed on Michelle the day before had been much quicker.\nMichelle framed his face with her hands, her expression a mixture of joy as well as unease. The latter must\u0026rsquo;ve been because of the growing pain he was beginning to feel. Within a few seconds, his head felt like it was going to explode, added with a fair deal of nausea that made him lose his balance.\nThankfully, Michelle was paying attention, and she caught him before he could even begin to fall, helping him settle down on the bed as the pain in his head grew further. Despite the visible distress, Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t show any sign of concern or fear, which James interpreted that this was within her expectations. He drew comfort from that, lying back on the bed, with her climbing on top of him.\n\u0026ldquo;Just a bit longer,\u0026rdquo; she whispered. \u0026ldquo;Then it\u0026rsquo;ll be better.\u0026rdquo;\nIt sure as hell couldn\u0026rsquo;t get any worse, as the pain now clearly affected his vision and he was barely able to make out her face anymore. A second later his vision was completely gone, and her comforting touch was all that kept him from panicking.\nA few moments later, the pain began to subside, and his vision returned. And as it did, he saw Michelle in a new light. The first thing he noticed was that any sign of unease was washed away from her face as she smiled at him brightly. Only then did he notice the level of detail he could detect on her. Even in the dim light, he could see every tiny detail on her face and see that she was flawless.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed.\n\u0026ldquo;Right back at you,\u0026rdquo; Michelle joked, \u0026ldquo;and now the good stuff is going to start!\u0026rdquo;\nJames noticed a blue hue on her face and immediately figured that it must be the reflection of his eyes. Apparently his eyes were the same color as hers when in super form.\n\u0026ldquo;No more headache?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No more pain!\u0026rdquo; Michelle answered.\nNow James was curious to see the stuff happening to him with his own eyes - only to remember that he didn\u0026rsquo;t own a full length mirror to do so. Still, he rose from the bed. Now that the headache was gone, he wanted to at least give Michelle a good view of what was happening.\n\u0026ldquo;Woah\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed as he almost lost his balance again. He still felt a bit dizzy.\nWhile holding his head, he noticed that his hair was beginning to fall out. For a moment he panicked before the lack of concern on Michelle\u0026rsquo;s face reminded him that this was still going as planned. He tried to focus on her: the simple joy she expressed in watching the show of his hair falling out only to be replaced with totally new-grown hair. Nobody had ever mentioned that his head would itch like hell as this happened!\nFortunately, this ended after about twenty seconds. “Thank God for not having long hair,” he thought to himself before his whole body began to feel funny, as if his bones were being bent against their will - which was probably true. This continued, and the funny feeling became more and more uncomfortable as he began to notice his perspective getting higher. Michelle still didn\u0026rsquo;t show any concern. In fact her smile grew as she sat there on the bed, her eyes darting over his lengthening body. That smile alone made things bearable for him.\nStill, James was relieved when this phase ended, and the height growth subsided after what he estimated to be three or four inches at best - hopefully, less. He barely had time to consider whether or not his new height would be troublesome when the next stage started as he felt his muscles cramping up and flexing involuntarily.\n\u0026ldquo;Ugh,\u0026rdquo; he grunted through gritted teeth. Given what he knew from Michelle\u0026rsquo;s experiences, James had expected things to be a lot more comfortable by now. Truth be told, the cramps weren\u0026rsquo;t nearly as bad as the headache before; actually, they were less unpleasant than some normal cramps he had experienced. But while the feeling wasn\u0026rsquo;t the same as it had been for Michelle, the outcome apparently was.\n\u0026ldquo;It looks like someone\u0026rsquo;s working out!\u0026rdquo; Michelle said seductively, nervously moving over the blankets.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s one way to put it,\u0026rdquo; James answered. In fact, now that he thought about it, the muscle growth phase did feel a lot like one hell of a workout - one where he didn\u0026rsquo;t actually do anything. Still, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t deny that he liked the outcome. While he was quite athletically built from the get go, he had no problems with his body reaching bodybuilder qualities, especially not with Michelle barely capable holding herself back there. Now that he looked back at her, he noticed that she was sweating quite a bit. So far she had never perspired due to exhaustion since her transformation. The only reason for her to do so was\u0026hellip;\nHe gulped. Was she really that horny?\nAfter a few minutes his muscles stopped flexing, allowing him to move freely again. He looked down at himself and couldn\u0026rsquo;t prevent a sheepish grin. Yep, he could easily enter any bodybuilding contest and win by a landslide.\nA wave of energy suddenly washed over him, and with it any remnants of the cramps disappeared altogether. Since he was still watching himself, he noticed the strange glow that appeared from right underneath his skin wherever the energy had been. Now he was able to see the super energy as well.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, this is really a new perspective,\u0026rdquo; he commented as he looked back to Michelle. With a smile, he began walking over to her. Even though the transformation itself wasn\u0026rsquo;t arousing at all - as opposed to Michelle\u0026rsquo;s - her mere presence more than made up for it, even though she was in her mortal form.\nJames blinked. Just now he realized that it bothered him that she was still in her mortal form. He didn\u0026rsquo;t really know why, though. Sure her other self was more attractive, but that wasn\u0026rsquo;t it. The only other difference would be her powers - or lack thereof right now. Yeah, that was it. Even though her mortal form was still capable of winning several gold medals right now - he felt strangely sure about that - this was nothing compared to what her other self was capable of. No, if anything, James wanted her to turn back into the goddess she had been before.\nWith this in mind, he leaned down to kiss her. Even before their lips met, he noticed how he instinctively tried to share some of his super energy with her through skin contact; more surprising than this, however, was that he failed to do so because Michelle was refusing it from her end.\n\u0026ldquo;Why aren\u0026rsquo;t you accepting the energy?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Where is the fun in that?\u0026rdquo; Michelle teased. \u0026ldquo;I want you to make me accept it!\u0026rdquo;\nNow that was an interesting turn of events! Michelle, who had wanted him to take the potion, was now turning the tables. James already had some ideas about how he could break her concentration\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Whoa\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; James suddenly exclaimed as he felt what he first thought to be losing his balance, but quickly noticed it was something else entirely.\n\u0026ldquo;Finally, you\u0026rsquo;re getting airborne,\u0026rdquo; Michelle exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;I almost doubted that you could fly at all since you didn\u0026rsquo;t lift off right away.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe I didn\u0026rsquo;t think happy thoughts,\u0026rdquo; James countered as he lowered himself again, quickly finding that flying was far easier than he had anticipated. Leaning down to her again, he whispered, \u0026ldquo;Maybe you\u0026rsquo;d like to join me up here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A tempting offer,\u0026rdquo; Michelle held up her hands. \u0026ldquo;I hope you\u0026rsquo;re strong enough to carry me!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Strength is definitely not the issue,\u0026rdquo; James thought to himself only to realize that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly true. Up until now, Michelle had used her power sharing to prevent him from harm when she was in her super form. That only worked because he was a normal human being and couldn\u0026rsquo;t affect the super energy; Michelle, however, denied him this, meaning that there was risk of hurting her if he used too much strength.\nA smirk appeared on her face. She had planned this!\nStill, James played along. Carefully he lifted her off the bed and turned around in midair, resulting in her lying on top of him in a close embrace. With their skin contact maximized, James couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but try to share the super energy with her, but Michelle kept refusing.\n\u0026ldquo;Hmm, cuddling already?\u0026rdquo; she mocked as she straightened herself up, sitting on top of him now. \u0026ldquo;I thought we\u0026rsquo;d be more active before that.\u0026rdquo; She ran her hands over his chest, actually trying - and failing - to dent his pectorals. \u0026ldquo;Hmm, not just for show, it seems.\u0026rdquo;\nJames had to admire her willpower. Despite her undeniable arousal, she managed to keep herself under control. He was positive that a big part of her wanted to stop this futile resistance, turn into the goddess she was supposed to be and then start the lovemaking of a lifetime. But this game had already started, and she wanted him to make the first move.\nHe complied. As Michelle leaned down to tease him again, he grabbed her head - carefully - and kissed her passionately. At the same time, he forced himself to stop trying to push the energy into her. Continuing their kiss, his hands traveled down her body. He reached her breasts and slowly fondled them, steadily increasing her anticipation, before suddenly trying to blast as much super energy into them as he could.\n\u0026ldquo;Aaahhh!\u0026rdquo; Michelle threw her head back, her brown hair instantly growing and turning blonde, doing so while she changed into her super form.\nJames watched in awe as her breasts readily absorbed the energy he offered which caused them to be the very first part of her to take on super proportions. For the fragment of a second, her DD-cup breasts looked outright ridiculously large on her small frame before the energy spread throughout her body and caused it to catch up on that front. Only a few seconds were needed for the transformation to be complete; her moaning, however, lasted longer.\n\u0026ldquo;Now that\u0026rsquo;s what I call foreplay!\u0026rdquo; Michelle exclaimed as she had regained control. \u0026ldquo;How is it? Do you like what you see?\u0026rdquo;\nWhat a stupid question.\n\u0026ldquo;The most beautiful woman in the world,\u0026rdquo; he answered, dragging her in for a kiss.\n\u0026ldquo;Hm, good answer, and now to the main course.\u0026rdquo; Her hands traveled down his body, and when she reached his member, her eyes widened. \u0026ldquo;Feels like your little friend isn\u0026rsquo;t so little anymore\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThanks to her touch, he was standing at attention as well.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you going to do about that?\u0026rdquo; he asked teasingly.\n\u0026ldquo;Just wait and see\u0026hellip; but first we need to get out of here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t want to tear the building down, do we?\u0026rdquo;\nJames gave her an understanding nod, and Michelle made her way to the window before noticing the second vial of super potion still lying on the floor.\n\u0026ldquo;You may want to drink that,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want you to run out of steam right when it\u0026rsquo;s good after all!\u0026rdquo;\nShe then opened the window and quickly flew through it. Nobody outside had a chance in noticing her flight.\nAs she rose up to the night sky, he remembered an important detail about that second dose: It had been from Michelle\u0026rsquo;s plant as opposed to the one from the lab. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that mean he would mutate again and become related to her in the process? James shook his head. Despite his fear, he just knew that this - or any other - potion would only increase his energy supply while the mutation was only caused by the very first dose, and he had already taken that. Not allowing himself another doubt, he downed the contents of the second vial and followed Michelle into the night sky.\nIt didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for him to catch up to her, and he was relieved to notice that she still attracted him just as much as before. In fact nothing could compare to this image of angelic beauty that glowed in the night sky - even though said glowing was caused by his ability to see the super energy inside her. The fact that he was defying gravity on his own to reach her suddenly seemed trivial at best.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, where were we?\u0026rdquo; he asked as he hugged her. \u0026ldquo;Oh yeah, right the main course!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right here where everybody could see us? How about we find some place more private?\u0026rdquo; she suggested.\nJames had his doubts that normal people would be able to spot them up here. Other supers on the other hand would have no problem doing so. And he could see it in Michelle\u0026rsquo;s eyes that she had already made a plan for that as well.\n\u0026ldquo;I take it you don\u0026rsquo;t want to add a few more craters to the nearby mountainside?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle shook her head as she grinned. \u0026ldquo;When I flew around the world yesterday, I spotted this cute little island in the Pacific Ocean. It\u0026rsquo;s so romantic and uninhabited to boot.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sounds like it\u0026rsquo;ll take a while to get there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If we fly full speed, it should only be a few minutes. Come, this way.\u0026rdquo;\nMiu looked around the club and frowned. Even though it was the middle of the week, the room was full. Well, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t really one to talk as she roamed the city on her own like that every night. While Monday she had been out with friends, both yesterday and today had been all about her. Most of these friends hadn\u0026rsquo;t heard the good news about her miraculous recovery yet. So far, the only people she had told about the powers she had possessed once were the two she had met in the bar earlier who obviously had more knowledge on the matter than herself.\nThis had both its good and bad sides. The good side was that they had been giving her a lot of information about herself and the big picture regarding the hybrids of which she was now one, especially considering that she seemed to possess a talent that other supers didn\u0026rsquo;t have: the ability to track down anybody she had met before. As for the bad side, there was the issue of her giving them full disclosure on her actions while having the powers, which included her exacting her revenge on the man responsible for binding her to a wheelchair for years.\nThat was a thing of the past, though. Even with the incredible powers gone, her legs still worked the way they had before. When Miu watched the crowded dance floor, she didn\u0026rsquo;t feel miserable like she would have a few days ago; in fact, she considered joining these people and showing them what she could do.\nShe had done that yesterday and was still happy with the outcome. One would think that, after not being able to walk for years, her legs’ muscularity would have atrophied to the point where dancing would be out of question for a time. Not for her. Miu had rocked the dance floor for hours without a break before even feeling tired. She also had gotten attention from a few guys, actually, but nothing had come from that.\nNow that she thought about it, she wondered how her other self would have fared. With these supernatural looks, she would\u0026rsquo;ve had a guy at each finger - and probably each toe as well. Miu subconsciously rubbed her thighs together. The more she thought about it, the more she liked the idea of becoming this superpowered goddess again, which is why she was here in the first place.\nUnfortunately, Miu wasn\u0026rsquo;t very tall, and finding the person she looked for wasn\u0026rsquo;t as easy. In fact, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t even sure whether she was at the right place right now. After all this was her first test run of using her tracking ability since she had turned back to normal. She shook her head. No, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the time to doubt herself. Closing her eyes, she tried to access her tracking ability. There he was!\nWithout a second thought, she turned around to make her way through the crowd into a corner where a certain someone was eyeing the situation. As his blue eyes met hers, he actually seemed to need a moment to recognize her.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s you,\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;Uhm… Miu was it?\u0026rdquo;\nShe nodded, not caring to bother that he even struggled to remember her name. She didn\u0026rsquo;t even know his. \u0026ldquo;We need to talk.\u0026rdquo;\nHe seemed utterly surprised but eventually shrugged before answering, \u0026ldquo;Sure, why not?\u0026rdquo;\nThey searched for a free booth even though it was crowded, and Miu was surprised that there actually was one that allowed them to talk in private.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, what do you want?\u0026rdquo; he asked once they sat down, \u0026ldquo;and more importantly how did you find me?\u0026rdquo;\nMiu smirked upon hearing that. This confirmed that her tracking ability was indeed special.\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, I wanted to talk about the effect you had on me,\u0026rdquo; she began. \u0026ldquo;You could say I turned into a totally different person for a bit, and when I turned back\u0026hellip; well you can see for yourself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, I tend to have that effect on women,\u0026rdquo; he said with pride, \u0026ldquo;and for some reason it\u0026rsquo;s also a one-time thing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know what you mean,\u0026rdquo; Miu answered. \u0026ldquo;Actually, I was looking for you to talk about that aspect. Do you know why we have no interest in hooking up anymore?\u0026rdquo;\nHe shook his head.\n\u0026ldquo;Well it\u0026rsquo;s actually quite simple. You mutated me into some kind of half-alien-plant hybrid, and the alien part of my DNA happens to be an exact copy of the alien part of your DNA, effectively making us related now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alien? Sorry to break your illusion, but I\u0026rsquo;m not from outer space,\u0026rdquo; he answered. \u0026ldquo;I may be out of this world, but not in the literal sense!\u0026rdquo;\nYep, he sure had no self-esteem problems.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not what I meant! I\u0026rsquo;ve been talking to a scientist who has figured out that anybody who had these powers once was actually a half-alien hybrid. The alien part seems to come from a plant, which you probably know better than me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not really following you here, but I get that when I gave you these powers, I turned you into a relative.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pretty much. I figured you would want to know that. Especially since you helped me out a lot here.\u0026rdquo; She clapped on to her legs to empathize.\n\u0026ldquo;I guess that makes sense, and I guess the solution to that happening would be for the woman to gain her powers from some other plant instead of me?\u0026rdquo;\nMiu nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I figured as much. So, all I have to do is either find someone like this or another plant.\u0026rdquo; He took a sip from his drink. \u0026ldquo;Is there anything else you wanted to tell me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hm, now that you bring it up, I\u0026rsquo;d… like to have this power again.\u0026rdquo; Miu felt herself blush as she said that. Truth be told, she had trouble admitting it to herself; asking someone else was even worse.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha! I can imagine that,\u0026rdquo; he leaned over. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m not charity. What am I getting out of the deal?\u0026rdquo;\nMiu pondered her options. Sex was clearly out of question. Even though her benefactor was absolutely hot in appearance, the aforementioned incest problem made her lose any interest in that. There was no further information she could give him, either, except for one thing.\n\u0026ldquo;You asked me how I found you, right? Well, there\u0026rsquo;s a little trick to that. Apparently, I have some kind of special ability that allows me to track people. If I were super, I could show you how to do it!\u0026rdquo; She added a quick explanation about how such special abilities could be passed down by sharing the person\u0026rsquo;s super energy with one another. Even though she wasn\u0026rsquo;t a real expert on that, the idea of regaining the power grew on her. Earlier she may have had no interest in that, given that her actions with these powers had been harsh if not evil. Ever since she had met Devil and learned that these powers would return on their own, she had begun to reconsider the situation. By now she had stopped wondering how she would have reacted if Devil had offered these powers to her and wondered why she hadn\u0026rsquo;t asked her for them instead.\n\u0026ldquo;The ability to track people? So you could tell me where the Angel is right now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; uhm,\u0026rdquo; Miu hesitated. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t even considered the possible usage of this ability. \u0026ldquo;M-maybe\u0026hellip; I mean\u0026hellip; I only used it twice so far on people I have met before, and it was a lot easier when I was super.\u0026rdquo;\nHe leaned back and apparently considered his options. \u0026ldquo;If you say you want that power back, how much exactly are you talking about?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As much you\u0026rsquo;d like to give me,\u0026rdquo; Miu answered sheepishly. She had barely prevented herself from blurting out \u0026ldquo;As much as possible!\u0026rdquo; instead.\nHe raised his brow but then burst into laughter. \u0026ldquo;Well, given that women don\u0026rsquo;t seem to regenerate the stuff at all, it only seems plausible that you want as much as possible.\u0026rdquo;\nMiu nodded, happy that he understood. What\u0026rsquo;s more was that he seemed to think that regenerating super energy would be a male trait. According to Devil, this was not the case; it was rather a matter of time for her to be able to recharge on sunlight alone. Still, Miu decided not to mention that. After all, this way he would give her more.\n\u0026ldquo;H-how long does it take for you to regenerate?\u0026rdquo; she asked eventually. After all, this was something unknown to anyone.\nHe leaned back in thought, then scratched his head as he answered. \u0026ldquo;Actually, I have no idea. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit strange, actually. I didn\u0026rsquo;t use these powers too much in the last weeks. In fact, the most power consuming thing I did so far would be sex: making my partner invulnerable so I can use more strength than I need to, and ultimately my seed takes quite a lot of power with it, but strangely I feel perfectly rested only a few moments later - being fully recovered so to speak.\u0026rdquo;\nMiu raised her brow. \u0026ldquo;A few moments? That sounds awfully quick.\u0026rdquo;\nHe shrugged. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s how it feels. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t always like that. Especially in the beginning, it took me a while to feel\u0026hellip; full. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;m not really full, but storing that extra energy somewhere else to become available after I exert myself?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe you should have that checked out?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I’ll leave the research to you,\u0026rdquo; he said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;Then again, maybe I’ll power you up as much as possible and wait to see when I\u0026rsquo;m back at full power?\u0026rdquo;\nMiu blushed, and her eyes grew wide. Had she just heard right? He was intending to give her all of his power? That sounded fishy. She may not be the person to take advantage of this, but he was putting a lot more trust in her than was good for him. For God\u0026rsquo;s sake she didn\u0026rsquo;t even know his name! \u0026ldquo;A-all of your power? I-isn\u0026rsquo;t that a bit much?\u0026rdquo; she found herself stammering.\n\u0026ldquo;I told you I recover quickly,\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t believe me, it would be best for me to show you. After all, the night is still young, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;d like to get your boost sooner rather than later. Truth be told, that tracking ability of yours sounds really interesting.\u0026rdquo;\nHe rose from the seat and looked around. \u0026ldquo;Alright, lets find a quiet place then.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Gotcha!\u0026rdquo; James exclaimed as he brought his arms around Michelle to hug her closely. Under other circumstances this might have counted as the romantic gesture it was, but, given the speed with which they were moving across the ocean, his exclamation would never reach Michelle\u0026rsquo;s ears even though they were so close. After all, they were traveling at almost Mach 35: a speed where the sound of his voice couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep up.\nSo far the trip had been a strange mixture of teasing and learning for him. Michelle had turned a trip of several thousand miles into a game of tag by having James chase her, steadily picking up speed to force him to eventually reach the maximum speed he was capable of.\nThat speed was around Mach 35. The number didn\u0026rsquo;t surprise him that much, actually. After all, before her stunt with the plane, Michelle had traveled around the world in about an hour with her own max speed as well. He had done the math and figured that her top speed had been around the same back then, so it was only fair for him to reach similar levels now. The truly interesting part, however, was that he had a very… intuitive feel about the numbers at play here. Even though he had no equipment to measure their speed, he just knew how fast they were among other things.\n\u0026ldquo;Nicely done!\u0026rdquo; Michelle answered; her lips were not moving, but her thoughts arrived right in his mind. \u0026ldquo;Now let\u0026rsquo;s pick up the pace, shall we?\u0026rdquo;\nJames held fast to her, already expecting that her top speed had improved significantly after the plane incident. Yet he had trouble counting the number of sonic booms that followed as her speed tripled. Holding on to her was a good idea after all, given that she would be out of sight the moment he let go.\nFortunately for him, they arrived at their destination about ten seconds later. Somewhere in the darkness of the sea, there was a tiny uninhabited island. Michelle slowed down, and they descended still in each other\u0026rsquo;s arms.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you think about it?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked, her words being able to reach his ears again.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s perfect. A tiny place of paradise with nobody around but us.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle smiled and James couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist the urge to kiss her. Her scent filled his nostrils and quickly reawakened the primal urges that had taken the back seat during their trip here. The logical explanation for this was that, during their supersonic flight, breathing had been optional to begin with. Neither of them paid any mind to logical explanations now. Their kissing became more passionate as they were still hovering high above the island. His hands traveled across her body, squeezing and fondling where they could. He had done so before, but this time everything felt different. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t just his heightened senses that made a difference. Michelle herself was a lot more… passionate\u0026hellip; right now.\nHe felt her grabbing his member to slowly stroke it before spreading her legs as a definite sign for him to enter her. James gladly complied and smiled as she moaned in return. When Michelle looked back at him, the light coming from her eyes seemed even brighter than before - and filled with more passion than he thought possible. She then leaned in for a close embrace and brought them into a horizontal position with him on top of her.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, time to come to paradise,\u0026rdquo; she whispered in his ear before dragging him downwards.\nFor a split-second James though she simply stopped keeping herself afloat but then he noticed that she was indeed flying towards the ground instead. Once he gave up his resistance, the ground came closer quickly. Before he could figure out her intentions, they crashed into the sandy beach.\nBoom!\nSand flew in every direction as their bodies landed with more force than most bombs could achieve. Not even a second later another Boom! followed, along with more sand that came out of the growing crater the two of them had created there. James body had figured out her intentions before his mind could keep up: Michelle intended to use the ground as leverage for him to drill her. And that he did, as every subsequent thrust caused another Boom! accompanied with moans from Michelle that grew louder and louder.\n\u0026ldquo;Aaahhhhhh,\u0026rdquo; Michelle suddenly screamed in pleasure as she reached her climax. Instead of letting James drill her further into the ground, she now actively resisted, pushing them slowly, but surely out of the crater.\nJames noticed that the super energy inside her seemed to go wild, running through her body with incredible speed - and an equally incredible side-effect, her body began to glow slightly. Glow in a way that it didn\u0026rsquo;t require super senses to see it. James remembered the previous night when this had happened. Back then, it had taken longer for her to do so, however.\n\u0026ldquo;D-don’t\u0026hellip; stop!\u0026rdquo; he heard her voice in his mind.\nApparently he had hesitated a bit when he noticed her glowing, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be asked twice and quickly picked up the pace. Michelle threw her head back in the process, her hands gripping his back with all her might - and he even felt pain as her fingernails dug into his flesh. That didn\u0026rsquo;t slow him down however, if anything it caused him to try even harder. Their bodies moved in perfect synch with each other now, her body anchoring itself for each thrust, while her inner walls massaged his member in a way only she could do.\nOpening her eyes Michelle grinned as she blasted a short burst of heat vision onto his chest. James was startled for a split-second, but immediately realized that her heat vision didn\u0026rsquo;t penetrate his skin at all. The only thing he could feel was a slight warmth where he was hit, as the excess energy was absorbed into his body. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t much, but he knew it was there.\nHe began to grin as he recalled her story about how the heat vision was discovered in the first place, and her smile told him that she was looking forward to a second coming of that. Actually, she probably blasted him for the sole purpose of enabling him to return the favor. Focusing the super energy in his eyes, he shot two beams of light right onto her erect nipples.\n\u0026ldquo;Aaahhhhhh!\u0026rdquo; Michelle\u0026rsquo;s answer was yet another scream, as her body rocked with the incredible force of her orgasm. The light emanating from her became brighter, surpassing the level she had the night before. James noticed that her body began to feel different, the very touch of her skin now seemed inherently pleasurable.\nThis change applied to every place their bodies touched, from her hands on his back, her back under his– and, most importantly, her inner walls that still massaged his member. James still continued to blast his heat vision into her breasts, his body moving on autopilot here. The sudden spike in pleasure she inspired in him took its toll and a mere five seconds after it started, he could take no more.\nWithout a warning he shot his load into her, and immediately felt her being rocked by yet another orgasm. Once again the light coming from her grew brighter, and she drew him in for a kiss. He barely noticed the sizeable amount of super energy he had blasted into her, as though his rational mind had taken the back seat and all he could do was to enjoy the moment with Michelle. And so they remained in a close embrace, hovering over the beach of a small island, lost in the afterglow of their lovemaking.\n\u0026ldquo;Aright, let\u0026rsquo;s do this,\u0026rdquo; was all he said.\nMiu and her yet unknown benefactor had found a small sidestreet a block from the club where they were alone.\nHer heart almost skipped a beat as she realized that this was it. In a moment she would be the unstoppable goddess that she had been a few days ago. Even though she had been there before, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but look forward to it.\n\u0026ldquo;Take my hand!\u0026rdquo; he said, and Miu quickly complied.\n\u0026ldquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t know your name,\u0026rdquo; she sheepishly exclaimed, just to distract herself a bit.\n\u0026ldquo;This is good,\u0026rdquo; he commented.\nHis hands felt… normal. No, not normal, but rather the same way Devil\u0026rsquo;s had felt when Miu had shaken her hand earlier that evening. She knew that she could feel the difference between a human and a hybrid like herself, so it didn\u0026rsquo;t surprise her as much. What did surprise her was that she could already feel the energy flowing into her body through their hands. Miu felt that she could indeed force it to stop, but why would she do that?\nAs the energy began to fill her, she felt her body responding in kind. Miu closed her eyes as the energy traveled to her head, her mind seemingly awakening and opening up to the new sensations she would be able to pick up soon. Her perception was so good already that she could already feel the growth of her own hair happening at the same time.\nMiu smiled as she reveled in the feeling. It just felt so good to feel this energy again, and it happened a lot faster than the first time around.\n\u0026ldquo;Time to pick up the pace,\u0026rdquo; she heard her benefactor say.\nHe wasn\u0026rsquo;t kidding. The flow of energy from him suddenly doubled - no, tripled! - in velocity. Miu moaned as the energy made its way to every part of her body with the transformation now happening even faster. Still closing her eyes, Miu felt her clothes constrict around her frame, then groan in protest, before her growing body began to rip them apart. A part of her wanted to at least save her shoes from that fate, but, when she tried to put them off in this position, all she did was rip them apart with more force.\nThe power continued to fill her, and Miu could already picture the trim titaness that she had become by now as the last stage of her transformation began. She began to moan - totally ignoring the man standing right in front of her who made the entire thing possible - as the power entered her breasts, causing them to grow in size just like the rest of her body had done. Miu felt herself getting lighter and lifted off the floor altogether. Only a few seconds later, her transformation was over, yet the flow of power didn\u0026rsquo;t cease. Her freshly expanded breasts seemed all too eager to store the power. Miu smiled all the more as she realized just how much capacity they provided - so much more than the rest of her body - and filling that capacity felt great.\nOpening her eyes again, Miu was shocked for a split-second as she hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected to see her benefactor the way she did now. She could clearly see what she had thus far only felt: the power going from him to her. The strange part was that, on the outside, he didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have as much capacity as her. Well, actually, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t much of a surprise given that he lacked the breasts that made up the majority of her capacity. How was he able to fill her up that much then? It didn\u0026rsquo;t look like his supply lessened in any way!\nCuriosity got the better of her, and Miu activated her X-ray vision. Even though she had used it during her first time as a super, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t fully prepared for what she saw. There were the insides of the human - or, in this case, superhuman - body that she had expected. Besides that, there was something else inside him. Thick, greenish veins ran parallel to his blood vessels branching throughout his whole body, held together by some kind of core right next to his stomach. From there on, some kind of roots seemed to have settled around the stomach itself as well as the rest of his digestive system.\nThinking back at her conversation with Devil and that scientist, Miu came to the conclusion that this must be a plant similar to the ones they had talked about, except that this one had grown inside the man’s body instead of a flower pot. This also explained the seemingly endless amount of reserves he had. Whenever his own supply was used up, the plant inside him would immediately recharge him, effectively increasing his capacity by that of the plants.\nOnce Miu had come to this conclusion, she stopped the energy transfer on her part. This was partially because she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to cut too big a hole in his not-so-infinite supply and partially because she knew that, if she reached her full capacity, she would never be able to turn back; that was a step she wasn\u0026rsquo;t willing to take just yet. Now that she thought about it, this meant that her benefactor was stuck like this, too, even without the plant inside him keeping him super-charged.\n\u0026ldquo;It seems like you can\u0026rsquo;t take anymore!\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed as he let go of one hand, still holding the other.\nMiu nodded and finally allowed herself to concentrate on herself again. The amount of power that had found its way into her body was several times more than it had been the first time. She wondered how long it would last? At least for the next 24 hours, she thought, but that probably depended on what she would do with her time.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, now it\u0026rsquo;s your turn,\u0026rdquo; he suddenly said.\n\u0026ldquo;Hmm\u0026hellip; what? Oh, yeah\u0026hellip; right\u0026hellip; the tracking ability.\u0026rdquo;\nMiu quickly tried to access this ability - figuring she should try tracking down Devil\u0026rsquo;s current position - and immediately felt the distance and direction in which she was situated. From the looks of it, she would assume that she was at the hospital right now. Confident she knew that it worked, she directed some of this energy back through their hands and into his body.\n\u0026ldquo;Okay, that should do the trick. If you try to locate someone you know, you should be able to sense where they are.\u0026rdquo;\nHe closed his eyes, then suddenly turned sideways and opened them again.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, I think I got it!\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed as he turned back to Miu. \u0026ldquo;Well, that settles our deal\u0026hellip; bye!\u0026rdquo;\nMiu was tempted to ask him about his plans now but figured that he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t tell her anyway. After all, she still didn\u0026rsquo;t know his name, and he made it clear that he didn\u0026rsquo;t want her to know it. The bottom line was that she was already concentrating on planning her next course of action as the night was only so long after all.\nLooking down, she appreciated her body for once. Her physique was indeed something else, combining the fit and athletic build she had always strived for with larger-than-life curves, thus creating an image that emitted power while at the same time being incredible feminine. She smiled as she realized that only very few women on this planet could match these kinds of looks.\nUnfortunately, this couldn\u0026rsquo;t be said about her outfit. The transformation had mostly destroyed her clothes, and the rags that still clung to her body had no chance of keeping her decency. Any man who saw her like this would probably be reduced to one thought. The way she felt right now, Miu would be inclined to let them carry out that thought.\nShe felt herself rise higher in the air. Looking down, she giggled as she wiggled her toes that were now about three feet above the ground.\n\u0026ldquo;Now that could become a handicap on the dance floor,\u0026rdquo; she joked before returning to the more pressing issue and created an outfit for herself.\nHer choice fell on a green leotard paired with black leggings that went just below her knee - an outfit quite similar to the one she had worn when dancing in the studio. In terms of footwear, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t create more than ballerina-lookalikes anyway. All in all, Miu was pretty sure she had figured out why the Angel had chosen a similar skintight and minimalistic outfit: she simply couldn\u0026rsquo;t create a more elaborate one - at least unless she had the advanced cloth-creating abilities Devil had mentioned earlier. Those would have come in handy just now, but Miu would have to play with the hand she\u0026rsquo;d been dealt.\nPicking up her shredded outfit, she tried to use the rags as some kind of highlight and actually managed to turn her shredded blouse into a sarong that stuck to her outfit. Giving herself a final once-over, she touched down on the ground and strutted back towards the club.\nFrom the very moment she was out in the open again, the differences between the improved her and the goddess she was now became apparent. The people outside the club already turned their heads towards her - men and women alike. Miu tried to play it as cool as possible, but the joy of being the center of attention was just too much, and she rewarded the audience with a genuine smile.\nInside, things weren\u0026rsquo;t too different. The people who could notice her clearly had trouble taking their eyes off her. Miu giggled as she saw a girl quickly kissing the guy next to her in what seemed a desperate attempt to regain his attention. The guy was clearly surprised at first but didn\u0026rsquo;t look too unhappy about that.\nAs Miu continued her stride towards the dance floor, the people around her readily made way for her. As she stepped onto it, the same could be said for the dance floor itself. When a new song started to play, it became clear to her: Her stage had been set.\nThe Asian woman didn\u0026rsquo;t need another invitation. Yesterday she may have already rocked the dance floor, finding that she was already better than she had been before her forced two-yea hiatus. Now, her body was brimming with power, and Miu couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to give it a test run. Naturally, she began moving to the music, her improved mind already working on a choreography that would fit the music and test out the limitations of her new body - or rather the lack thereof.\nPutting the plans into motion was just unbelievably easy. The control she had over her body was just that great, making it ridiculously easy to perform the moves she had struggled with before her unwanted break. As she performed the dance of her life, Miu noticed that her audience grew steadily, with the people standing around the dance floor andcheering her on as her moves became more and more challenging. Before long, she could hear the song coming to its climax, and she couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but use the opportunity to give a big finale herself. Positioning herself at one end of the dance floor, she started with a series of backflips that carried her to the other side of the floor.\nIt was just too easy for her. Even two years ago she had been able to do that, but now it was just ridiculous. One, two, three … the backflips were nothing for her, and she mentally patted herself on the back for having calculated the amount of backflips she could do before reaching the end of the dance floor.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when she realized her mistake. Her calculations had been based on body size - her original body size. With her super form being taller, she had planned at least one too many backflips, and she was already in the process of performing it! Miu\u0026rsquo;s mind raced, hoping that the woman standing in her path had figured that out as well. Now refocusing, she noted that unfortunately the woman was just about to realize the mistake, too. A mere human wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to dodge in time, especially not with so many people behind her. Only Miu herself could prevent a crash, and she was almost back in the handstand that marked the halfway mark of the backflip when it hit her.\nJust as she was in the handstand, she used her flight powers to anchor herself, immediately stopping the flow of her motion. Then she pressed with her hands against the ground and did one more midair flip before landing in the middle of the dance floor again. With the song now over, there was a second of silence before the people around her suddenly burst into applause. Miu\u0026rsquo;s eyes quickly found the woman was relieved that she was alright; she was also applauding Miu for what everybody here assumed to be her planned grand finale.\nA new song began to play, and the applauding people now began occupying the dance floor themselves. Miu continued to dance but a lot tamer than before due to the much smaller space she had. Of course, her little show had left her the center of attention, and she wondered what to do next. After all, the night was still young, and she now had her pick from a number of admirers.\nThe small island looked more like a war-torn battlefield than the tiny paradise it had been mere hours before; Michelle, however, wasn\u0026rsquo;t that bothered about it. After all, the destruction had been caused by their lovemaking, and she had thoroughly enjoyed it. Now they were hovering in each other\u0026rsquo;s arms above the beach waiting for the first rays of the sun to arrive. It would still be many hours until the next sunrise on the mainland.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you thinking about?\u0026rdquo; James asked. \u0026ldquo;You seem worried.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just trying to figure out what happened earlier,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;You mean when you turned into a human light bulb?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle nodded. \u0026ldquo;It seems that the super energy is running wild during my orgasm which causes this reaction. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t really explain its other effect, does it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; James shrugged. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re more or less at war with the laws of physics, so the Law of Conservation of Energy is just one more victim here. That makes it hard to explain why we have more super energy than before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I probably shared something with you while we were at it,\u0026rdquo; Michelle tried to remember the details, but she had been kinda distracted back then, \u0026ldquo;or maybe you absorbed the light coming from me to generate super energy?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hmm, you mentioned that you absorb sunlight or heat, which makes it likely for us to absorb any kind electromagnetic wave, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense either.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why not? So far it made most sense to me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It may seem like that, but the numbers don\u0026rsquo;t add up. The energy carried by sunlight or even fire is far too low to allow feats like we can do. Carrying an airplane may be theoretically feasible with the energy provided by sunlight, but it’s not when you consider the size of the plant that was supposed to absorb it in a short timeframe.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe it can absorb more than its size suggests?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, that isn\u0026rsquo;t possible either. Even if it did, the result would be a darkness coming from the plant; since heat seems to be absorbed as well, it would also be cold. Even we - who have a similar ability - are warm to the touch, so we definitely don\u0026rsquo;t absorb every electromagnetic wave that we encounter.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, we don\u0026rsquo;t really recharge by absorbing anything?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I think the sunlight or the heat serve as catalysts that allow the plant - or our bodies - to generate the super energy, and your ‘glow-gasm’ may have been a catalyst as well.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle chuckled at the word and then focused on the first rays of the sun that appeared on the horizon. Given that they had been talking about it, she subconsciously paid attention to how her body reacted to the light, finding that it dulled her energy consumption - or rather caused her to regenerate slightly while her body still used up the energy it needed to retain its super form. Remembering how she had done the same several hours ago, she noticed that the light seemed to have a much bigger effect on her already.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, even if we\u0026rsquo;re not actually absorbing sunlight and heat, the fact remains that it restores our super energy, right? If sex has the same effect, I\u0026rsquo;m all for it; after all, that one clearly involves us both.\u0026rdquo; With a sensual smile, she added \u0026ldquo;Maybe we should give it another test run?\u0026rdquo; before kissing him again.\nSusan Harland couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep. She was lying curled up in the poor excuse for a bed that was her only furnishing of her prison cell - except the toilet, of course. By now she was wondering if solitary confinement was really better than having to share the cell with someone else. At least that way she would’ve had some conversation.\nInstead, she was alone. Once the cops were done with her questioning, she was placed here. Tomorrow things would continue, and the bail would be decided. She was confident that her father would be able to amass the money; he was rich after all. The real problem would be the conditions he\u0026rsquo;d probably bind to that. Today’s events had left Susan as some kind of freak: looking super, but now without the powers. She may not be the world-class geneticist that her father was, but she knew enough about the issue to know that she would probably exchange one prison cell for another. The new one would be full of many kinds of sensors that would try to pick up how her body worked now.\nWhy hadn\u0026rsquo;t she listened to her father’s advice and left the lab quickly? Nobody had been aware of her ascension, and, if she had played her cards right, that would still be the case. Instead, she had stuck around and vented her anger on the first person she came across: Deziree Archer. That woman had been in charge of \u0026ldquo;taking care\u0026rdquo; of Susan when she was at the lab - mostly so that she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t disturb her father\u0026rsquo;s work, of course.\nShe sighed. When she thought about the whole situation calmly, attacking Deziree must\u0026rsquo;ve been the single, most stupid thing she had ever done. Sure, she didn\u0026rsquo;t like the other woman, and that had been mutual from the beginning. What had started as Susan messing with the other woman had turned into what the police had called \u0026ldquo;attempted murder\u0026rdquo; which was far beyond what she had originally intended. It was by far the most problematic accusation that she faced. The only thing she had going for her was that she hadn\u0026rsquo;t been thinking straight. All things considered, that had been the truth.\nIn hindsight, her frustration of being sent to Deziree\u0026rsquo;s lab - where the latter had been tinkering with plants, instead of any other lab where the sudden appearance of superpowered women had been discussed - had been misaimed in an ironic way. After all, that was the lab where she had found that strange liquid that had powered her up during her fight with the Angel. In other words, the superpowers were in some way related to a plant in the lab, which was why Susan had been all too eager to inform the police that she\u0026rsquo;d been fucked into goddesshood with no mention of any plant whatsoever.\n\u0026ldquo;Hello, sleepy head,\u0026rdquo; came a familiar voice from the barred window.\nSusan turned around to find the very same guy who had turned her super in the first place. The first thing she noticed was that, despite the latter’s undeniable good looks, she didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any attraction to him the way she had this afternoon.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you want?\u0026rdquo; she whispered back as she rose from her bed.\n\u0026ldquo;Straight to the point, huh? Well, that makes it easier. I learned about a new aspect of our kind, and I want to test it out on you.\u0026rdquo;\nHe wanted to use her again. Susan hated that, but at least this guy had been honest about it. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t really complain on their first encounter either.\n\u0026ldquo;What would this be about?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, apparently, people like us have individual powers that others don\u0026rsquo;t have. At the same time, they can easily share that power with others by giving them a tiny bit of their energy. So, here\u0026rsquo;s the deal: I give you some of my energy, you return a tiny bit of it so I can get your individual power and you can keep the rest like last time. What do you say?\u0026rdquo;\nJust like that, she had been presented an alternative to being a guinea pig. Not to mention the crucial new piece of information.\n\u0026ldquo;If I understand that correctly, I\u0026rsquo;d get your individual power as well, right?\u0026rdquo;\nHe seemed to shrug, but it was hard to tell in the middle of the night through a small, barred window. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t really know what that would be, actually. Truth be told, you would already have received that one from me during our last encounter, but I already know that it works because I tried it with another woman\u0026rsquo;s tracking power.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tracking power?\u0026rdquo;\nHe sighed. \u0026ldquo;She - or rather we - can sense the location of any person we have met before. That\u0026rsquo;s how I found you here. You can test it out for yourself if you agree to the deal.\u0026rdquo;\nSusan thought about it, trying to figure out her own personal power. Remembering her fight with the Angel, the latter probably had some kind of super reaction that gave her a speed advantage during the fight. But what about Susan herself? Suddenly, the images of Deziree kissing her feet and that cop throwing away his gun and later explaining the plant liquid to her came to mind. All these events had happened right after she ordered them to do just that.\nA smirk appeared on Susan\u0026rsquo;s face. Her individual power was mind control! Part of her wanted to kick herself for not noticing that while she was able to use it, as it would have come in handy in her fight with the Angel. Then again, she could still play her cards right.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, I\u0026rsquo;m in,\u0026rdquo; Susan declared, holding out her hand towards the window. \u0026ldquo;Power me up!\u0026rdquo;\nWith a chuckle, he grabbed her hand and did as he was told. Susan could feel the familiar power entering her body again, and she quickly became weightless to stare him eye to eye through the barred window. All too quickly, however, she felt the flow of energy end.\n\u0026ldquo;That should be enough for you to get out of here,\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;Now it\u0026rsquo;s your turn; a tiny bit will be enough already.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, alright,\u0026rdquo; Susan said. \u0026ldquo;But first I\u0026rsquo;d like to test something myself.\u0026rdquo; She made sure he waslooking right into her eyes when their golden glow intensified. \u0026ldquo;Give me as much power as possible!\u0026rdquo;\nImmediately, he opened up the flow of power again, and Susan giggled as she quickly reached the levels of power she had this afternoon. It didn\u0026rsquo;t take long, and she felt full of power, while her benefactor seemed only half-depleted - not to mention utterly confused.\n\u0026ldquo;What the hell happened?\u0026rdquo; he asked. \u0026ldquo;D-did I power you up more?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed, you did!\u0026rdquo; Susan laughed back as she brought her arms to the bars and easily ripped them out of the window; then she ripped apart the concrete to make the window big enough for her to gracefully hover outside.\n\u0026ldquo;But, why?\u0026rdquo; the man wondered aloud, more surprised by his own actions than Susan\u0026rsquo;s feat of strength.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, let me explain,\u0026rdquo; Susan mused as she ripped apart her prison gown to create clothes of her own. Then she looked back into his eyes and once again applied the power in hers. \u0026ldquo;Because\u0026hellip; You are my slave!\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part16/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 16"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"Michelle bit her lip as she used her X-ray vision to keep track of the situation. After a fight with James she had visited her sister for some counseling about that - only to be disturbed by her sister\u0026rsquo;s girlfriend.\nThis wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be much of a problem if she were in her normal form. But she wasn\u0026rsquo;t. In order to travel the five hundred miles that usually separated the sisters, Michelle\u0026rsquo;s super powers had come in quite handy. While she had no problem telling J.J. about her recent ascension, Kelly however was a whole different deal; Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t know her enough to include her.\nSo the first thing Michelle had done when Kelly entered the apartment was to super-speed into the next best room, only to find that it didn\u0026rsquo;t have a big enough window for her. Now she was pretty much stuck here, unless she wanted to do another round of explaining.\nThrough the wall, she saw how Kelly went through the usual homecoming routine - taking off her jacket, kicking off her shoes and then giving J.J. a kiss as a greeting.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey,\u0026rdquo; J.J. said a bit anxiously. \u0026ldquo;How was your day?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Far too long,\u0026rdquo; Kelly mused as she hugged J.J. \u0026ldquo;I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait to get back here. And now I need a shower.\u0026rdquo; With a smirk she added, \u0026ldquo;Wanna join me?\u0026rdquo;\nThe nervousness on J.J.\u0026rsquo;s face was now hard to miss. \u0026ldquo;Uhm,\u0026rdquo; she began.\nMichelle\u0026rsquo;s thoughts raced as well, and she quickly put on the water in the shower before shouting, \u0026ldquo;Sis, could you lend me some of your clothes after the shower?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Y-yeah sure!\u0026rdquo; J.J. answered over an increasingly confused Kelly before addressing her. \u0026ldquo;My sister dropped by for a visit. And as you can hear, she\u0026rsquo;s in the shower.\u0026rdquo;\nKelly was obviously surprised by that - after all, she knew that Michelle lived far too much away for her to stop by unannounced. Still, she shrugged. \u0026ldquo;Guess I have to wait, then,\u0026rdquo; before kissing J.J. once more.\nMichelle on the other hand switched off her X-ray vision and faced herself in the bathroom mirror. Now that Kelly was aware of her presence, she needed to transform back to normal ASAP. Thank goodness she had spent several hours practicing just that skill today. This training had also shown that she had too much energy to transform back. But her body had already shown her a way to deal with that, too. Hurriedly, Michelle began looking for a suitable container.\nThe best thing she found was an empty soft drink bottle. How and why it had ended up in the bathroom was a mystery to Michelle, but she was just glad she had found something for this. Quickly she cleaned it up with hot water, while double-checking that the door was indeed locked, before disintegrating her costume. Now finally naked, Michelle held the cleaned bottle to her chest and concentrated on transforming back, forcing the super energy out of her and into the bottle. Her chest began tingling and soon she saw confirmation as her breast leaked supercharged milk into the bottle. It took her a whole minute of concentration before she came close to her actual goal. By now her power level had been reduced to the point where she could will herself back to normal - or at least normal looking.\nClosing the bottle again, she took a look at her mirror image. Her hair was brown again as were her eyes. And her breasts were back to their original A-cups while her overall figure slimmed down to her petite self. Happy that her transformation back had succeeded, she put the bottle of super milk down and began to hover under the shower.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; Jacob said as he looked down to see the city below them. On a clear night it was indeed a sight to behold.\nWhat was more remarkable than the sight however was how he had found his way up here. After all he was being carried by a woman who could fly on her own. This woman, Desire, wasn\u0026rsquo;t just carrying him, however. In fact she used some kind of power-sharing to make him just as weightless as herself. The only downside was that he was feeling dizzy because his body obviously wasn\u0026rsquo;t made to fly around.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad you like it,\u0026rdquo; said Desire, her green eyes glowing in the darkness as she held him tightly.\nFrom what Jacob understood, she didn\u0026rsquo;t really need to hold him this tight, but who was he to complain? Aside from her incredible powers, Desire was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. Actually, to him she was the most beautiful, which said something given that he had encountered three other women who were in her league, whereas most people only knew about the Angel that had become a public figure not even 24 hours ago.\nJacob found himself staring into her eyes more than enjoying the view of the city that she presented to him. She returned his gaze and, despite the darkness of the night, he could tell that she smiled at him. A sweet scent entered his nose and he immediately knew it was her. The fact that they were several miles in the air pretty much left no possible alternatives anyway. Still, the way he could pretty much feel his arousal growing left no doubt about it.\n\u0026ldquo;You really seem to be enjoying the sight,\u0026rdquo; she teased sheepishly.\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; he felt himself blushing. \u0026ldquo;It is a privilege to see it after all.\u0026rdquo; He wondered if it would be fine to kiss her. Normally he would take this chance in a situation like this - the worst that could happen would be the woman slapping him instead. A slap would hurt, but nothing more. This woman however was strong enough that a slap could kill him.\n\u0026ldquo;Aww, don\u0026rsquo;t worry. I won\u0026rsquo;t bite.\u0026rdquo; Desire\u0026rsquo;s voice did her name justice.\n\u0026ldquo;What? Are you reading my mind?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who knows? I\u0026rsquo;m rather new to this whole being super thing. But it felt like you were afraid of me.\u0026rdquo; She sounded sad. Jacob could almost hear the part she didn\u0026rsquo;t say: I don\u0026rsquo;t want you to be scared of me.\nThis encouraged him to take his chances. Not allowing himself to second-guess his decision, he leaned forward and kissed her. She clearly had expected him to do that, as she passionately answered the kiss. He felt her hold on him tighten as the wind seemed to speed up. The truth however was that Desire had picked up the pace, flying higher and higher as they kissed.\nAfter about ten seconds they released the kiss, and Desire slowed down so they came to a halt again.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; they both said in unison before they both started to laugh.\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t believe a simple kiss could be so … uplifting,\u0026rdquo; Jacob joked as he noticed her sweet scent intensifying.\n\u0026ldquo;Neither did I,\u0026rdquo; Desire answered, \u0026ldquo;it seems like the joy through the kiss intervened with the natural joy felt by flying resulting in a feedback reaction where both increased each other.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You lost me at kiss,\u0026rdquo; Jacob teased. \u0026ldquo;But it sounded quite scientific.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe I should put it differently: You made me think happy thoughts, so I flew higher.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hm, I hope I don\u0026rsquo;t make you leave the atmosphere if I do it again,\u0026rdquo; he said before acting upon his words. This time, they remained in place, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t make things less pleasant.\n\u0026ldquo;I could get used to this,\u0026rdquo; she said once their lips parted again.\n\u0026ldquo;And I begin to understand why you called yourself Desire,\u0026rdquo; Jacob commented.\nImmediately her smile disappeared from her face. Jacob couldn\u0026rsquo;t actually see her expression change - it was too dark for that. Instead he felt her mood darkening, not much but enough to make her frown.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t call me that,\u0026rdquo; she all but whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;What should I call you then?\u0026rdquo; he still had to ask.\nShe leaned over and this time actually whispered to his ear. \u0026ldquo;Deziree.\u0026rdquo;\nIf there was something that surprised him, then it was the fact how little this surprised him.\n\u0026ldquo;Why are you telling me this?\u0026rdquo; Jacob had no doubt that this was the same Deziree he had met earlier today. \u0026ldquo;This could cause you trouble.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because you helped saving my life earlier. It felt unfair to lie to you in return.\u0026rdquo; She then looked him straight in the eyes. \u0026ldquo;Will it cause me trouble?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not from me,\u0026rdquo; Jacob answered, now trying to compare the goddess before him with the woman he had met earlier. \u0026ldquo;And I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only one involved, in fact I was the least useful.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not true,\u0026rdquo; Deziree encouraged him. \u0026ldquo;You carried me when I couldn\u0026rsquo;t walk, and you helped me out when I truly needed it. Most importantly, if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for you, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re overestimating my help, really. It was me who told Ms. Harland about the liquid that powered her up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which ultimately led to her leaking the milk that transformed me into this,\u0026rdquo; Deziree countered. \u0026ldquo;All because of you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So you\u0026hellip; didn\u0026rsquo;t even use the potion we secured?\u0026rdquo; Jacob asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Deziree shook her head, before suddenly kissing him again. \u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;re giving me an idea.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter a quick shower, Michelle gave herself a final once-over in the bathroom mirror. This would be the first time where she would have to play normal while still having super energy inside her. During her shower she had managed to prevent an unnecessary transformation, and once she was out of the apartment this first test run would be over already. Still, she had asked J.J. for some clothes despite locking the bathroom door, so she couldn\u0026rsquo;t just create a new outfit.\nDressed in only a towel and hiding the bottle of milk inside, she settled back onto the floor before stepping out of the bathroom. Michelle may have kept her normal form all the time, but that hadn\u0026rsquo;t prevented her from being airborne all the time. Now, however, she needed her masquerade to be perfect.\nStepping into the living room, she found J.J. and Kelly entangled on the couch. Once they noticed her, they let go of each other and faced her.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, Michelle,\u0026rdquo; Kelly greeted her, and she looked a bit surprised as she did that. \u0026ldquo;Wow, you look good, did you start working out?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A bit,\u0026rdquo; Michelle lied. She was once again reminded of the slight changes that affected her normal form as well. Good thing it had been a while since she was last here, making it a lot easier to pretend that this was just a normal development for her.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright,\u0026rdquo; Kelly jumped out of the couch and walked past Michelle, giving her a teasingly seductive look. \u0026ldquo;Hope you didn\u0026rsquo;t use up all the hot water.\u0026rdquo;\nKelly smiled as she entered the bathroom. Usually her teasing would make Michelle feel uncomfortable, but today she seemed a lot more composed and confident. She bit her lips as she allowed herself to fantasize of a threesome with both Jenkins sisters. Kelly had always noticed how similar the two of them were, and what she had seen just now was a lot of improvement on Michelle\u0026rsquo;s part. “Maybe J.J. and her should get more into sports, too,” she thought as she stripped down in front of the bathroom mirror. Kelly giggled a bit as she could still smell Michelle\u0026rsquo;s lingering scent and she began to dance a bit in front of the mirror. For some reason it felt vitalizing despite her being quite exhausted after a long day. “Hmm,” the thought of watching J.J. work out together with her was quite something.\nCrunch.\nThe sudden noise brought her out of her fantasy as Kelly noticed a slight pain under her right foot.\nLooking down, she found she had stepped on a small glass vial with some greenish liquid that got quickly mixed up with the red of her own blood. Where that vial had come from, she didn\u0026rsquo;t know.\n\u0026ldquo;Please don\u0026rsquo;t be poisonous,\u0026rdquo; she thought.\n\u0026ldquo;I hate to break it to you, but it seems like my bras won\u0026rsquo;t fit you anymore,\u0026rdquo; J.J. concluded, \u0026ldquo;no matter how much you try to will them smaller.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle tried to ignore her sister\u0026rsquo;s snarky remark. She had indeed tried to decrease their size just a bit more, but apparently her normal form had slightly bigger breasts than before. It was barely visible, though, and it had only showed after she had tried on one of J.J.\u0026rsquo;s bras.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, screw this,\u0026rdquo; she said aloud and went for the obvious solution by willing herself a fitting bra into existence.\nNow J.J. stood there with her mouth open. From one moment to another, an almost exact replica of the bra Michelle had just tried on appeared on her frame - this one fitting her however.\n\u0026ldquo;So, aside from being super sexy, you can even create clothes?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yep,\u0026rdquo; Michelle answered with a smile as she put on the top that J.J. had laid out for her. This one was more forgiving of her new measurements. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a bit exhausting, however.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A small price to pay don\u0026rsquo;t you think? I mean you\u0026rsquo;ve been whining about being stuck in that Super Barbie form, but where exactly lies the downside here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, if you don\u0026rsquo;t see being a half-alien hybrid and the fact that eventually I won\u0026rsquo;t even be able to pretend to be me anymore as a downside, then there aren\u0026rsquo;t any.\u0026rdquo; She held up the bottle of super milk. \u0026ldquo;In that case you\u0026rsquo;ll probably want to take this.\u0026rdquo;\nJ.J. gulped before shaking her head. \u0026ldquo;N-not before asking Kelly,\u0026rdquo; she said.\nMichelle frowned. \u0026ldquo;I should\u0026rsquo;ve seen this one coming.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;After whining about how your boyfriend didn\u0026rsquo;t drink this stuff, you should have.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually this isn\u0026rsquo;t what I wanted him to drink. This is my milk, so whoever drank it would become related to me - which wouldn\u0026rsquo;t change much for you, but for James it would be disastrous. I had a vial of the potion for him that didn\u0026rsquo;t cause that kind of problem.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sounds complicated.\u0026rdquo;\nJust then the both of them heard a loud scream coming from the bathroom.\n\u0026ldquo;Kelly?\u0026rdquo; J.J. stated the obvious and already took off towards the source of the scream.\nMichelle followed her closely.\n\u0026ldquo;Kelly, are you alright?\u0026rdquo;\nThere was only a whimper behind the closed bathroom door.\n\u0026ldquo;Why, why, why?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle could still pick up Kelly\u0026rsquo;s almost silent cries and instinctively she used her X-ray vision to see what the problem was. She almost screamed herself.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on, I can hear you crying in there; what’s up?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;N-nothing,\u0026rdquo; a shocked Kelly tried to say but it was no use, her crying made it obvious that things weren\u0026rsquo;t okay.\n\u0026ldquo;Then open the door and let me see, sweetheart.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, I don\u0026rsquo;t want you to see me like this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually she\u0026rsquo;ll want to,\u0026rdquo; Michelle interfered. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s going to grow back immediately.\u0026rdquo;\nJ.J. looked at her quizzically as she had no idea what Michelle was talking about. \u0026ldquo;Kelly, please open the door! I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to break it.\u0026rdquo; It was obvious that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be her who would break it anyway.\nStill, Kelly complied and unlocked the door, allowing J.J. to open it.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, my God,\u0026rdquo; was all Michelle\u0026rsquo;s sister could say.\nThe woman that stood there was barely recognizable as Kelly, but neither J.J. nor Michelle doubted that she was. Kelly\u0026rsquo;s face had turned stunningly beautiful and now sported glowing blue eyes, but her hair had fallen out. From the neck down however, she seemed to be the same Kelly as before. At least Michelle suspected that the slightly chubby body was still unaffected.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s happening to me?\u0026rdquo; she asked at the verge of tears.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t hard for Michelle to figure this one out. From the corner of the eye she saw the broken vial with super serum on the floor mixed with blood that was obviously Kelly\u0026rsquo;s. Michelle\u0026rsquo;s heart sank as she realized that this had been the potion she had intended for James. She had carried it around all the time and had forgotten it when she disintegrated her costume earlier. Kelly must have stepped on it and became infected with the potion, as she was now obviously in the middle of her first super transformation.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s going to be okay,\u0026rdquo; J.J. calmed her down before turning around to Michelle for clarification. Her brain may not work with super speed, but she had gotten the gist of it\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re transforming,\u0026rdquo; Michelle said calmly, \u0026ldquo;and you\u0026rsquo;ll like the outcome.\u0026rdquo;\nNow Kelly seemed to notice Michelle and her glowing eyes widened. \u0026ldquo;Why are you glowing like that?\u0026rdquo; she asked to J.J.\u0026rsquo;s increased confusion.\nSighing, Michelle prepared for a full explanation. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not glowing, you’ve simply gained the ability to see the super energy that\u0026rsquo;s inside of me and you’re confusing it with a glow.\u0026rdquo; She pointed to the broken vial on the floor. \u0026ldquo;You can see it there too. It\u0026rsquo;s what is transforming you. Your hair will regrow and your whole body will improve until you look something like this.\u0026rdquo;\nTo prove her point, Michelle triggered her own transformation. Her hair grew out and turned blonde. With the super energy already inside her body she transformed almost instantly, growing a whole foot in height as her muscles took on fitness model proportions and of course added several cup sizes to her breasts. The top she had borrowed stood no chance of surviving her new measurements.\nNaturally Kelly yelped in surprise, and even J.J. stared at her despite knowing that Michelle could do that.\n\u0026ldquo;Y-you\u0026hellip; a-are\u0026hellip; t-the..\u0026rdquo; Kelly stammered, but Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t let her finish.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m still Michelle no matter what the media say. And by the way your hair is starting to grow out again.\u0026rdquo;\nSure enough, Kelly\u0026rsquo;s hair was growing quickly. Unlike her former blonde hair, this one was auburn in color, pretty much the opposite of how Michelle\u0026rsquo;s transformation had gone.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s beautiful,\u0026rdquo; J.J. commented, more to comfort her girlfriend than commenting on the outcome. After all it was still only a few centimeters long and thus far from its final length.\n\u0026ldquo;Will it … hurt?\u0026rdquo; Kelly asked. \u0026ldquo;I had some nasty headache earlier.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle shook her head. \u0026ldquo;The headache was the worst part of the whole thing. From now on its steadily going up, until you literally can\u0026rsquo;t keep your feet on the ground anymore.\u0026rdquo; As she said that Michelle remembered her own first transformation and subconsciously began hovering again.\nKelly\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened, but not as much as they had when Michelle had transformed. After all her ability to fly was her best known one. Her hair was about to reach her shoulders, and Kelly turned towards the mirror in surprise. Smiling, she felt her hair before turning towards J.J. again. \u0026ldquo;I think we need a bigger mirror,\u0026rdquo; she said before leaving the small bathroom, surely going to the bedroom and its full length mirror.\nJ.J. didn\u0026rsquo;t wait long to follow her, but she grabbed Michelle\u0026rsquo;s shoulder when she thought Kelly was out of earshot. \u0026ldquo;Please tell me this wasn\u0026rsquo;t your plan all along.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe her sister thought this of her. \u0026ldquo;Sis, I swear to God I had no intention for this to happen. Not like this, and honestly, not to her either.\u0026rdquo;\nThe relief was visible on J.J.\u0026rsquo;s face. She clearly preferred to trust Michelle, but given the strange coincidence she had to ask. \u0026ldquo;Alright, I believe you,\u0026rdquo; she said before picking up the pace to catch up to Kelly. \u0026ldquo;You still owe me a top, though.\u0026rdquo;\nSmiling, Michelle looked down at the remnants of said shirt. In her demonstration she had ruined the borrowed piece of clothing, but right now Kelly\u0026rsquo;s ascension was more important. There was only one first transformation for everyone, and after missing Amanda\u0026rsquo;s Michelle really looked forward to seeing the most important changes happening to Kelly.\nWhen they arrived in the bedroom, Kelly was admiring her mirror image as her hair was already reaching down her back. J.J. quickly positioned herself behind Kelly, looking over her shoulder as they both looked into the mirror.\n\u0026ldquo;Looking good,\u0026rdquo; she whispered into Kelly\u0026rsquo;s ear. By now she was as excited to see the next step of the transformation as Kelly herself.\nMichelle took the opportunity to switch on her super senses to their upmost capacity. She concentrated on Kelly\u0026rsquo;s body and the changes going through her but also used J.J. as a comparison.\n\u0026ldquo;Something\u0026rsquo;s happening,\u0026rdquo; Kelly exclaimed as Michelle saw a wave of super energy going through her. Through her own experience she knew what this was for, but now that Kelly was looking forward to the outcome, she saw no need to spoil the ride for her.\nThen it began. Kelly\u0026rsquo;s body cells started dividing themselves at an incredible speed. Slowly, she grew in height. Both women let out a gasp as they noticed, and J.J.\u0026rsquo;s hand traced Kelly\u0026rsquo;s stretching body as if to confirm her growth. Kelly\u0026rsquo;s excess fat disappeared in the process, dissolving to serve as fuel for the new cells. So aside from growing in height, Kelly also slimmed down in the process.\nAs she watched the growing difference in their bodies, Michelle also noticed that both women were getting aroused. She remembered the transformation had that kind of effect on her too, but so far it seemed to be mostly J.J.\u0026rsquo;s caressing that did it. It helped that J.J. had more and more trouble looking over Kelly\u0026rsquo;s shoulder as the latter simply became too tall for that. J.J. didn\u0026rsquo;t seem too bothered by this as she compensated by fondling Kelly more.\nA moan escaped Kelly\u0026rsquo;s lips as another surge went through her. Now that she had grown over a foot in height and slimmed down, it was time for her muscles to adapt to the power they would soon possess.\n\u0026ldquo;You have to see this, Jessica!\u0026rdquo; Kelly said, urging J.J. to watch her mirror image again.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d rather feel it,\u0026rdquo; J.J. answered, giggling as her hands traced Kelly\u0026rsquo;s what had once been a slightly flappy tummy and was now in the process of becoming one hell of a six pack. \u0026ldquo;Feels kinda warm,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;But it\u0026rsquo;s only natural if you turn hot, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have no idea,\u0026rdquo; Kelly turned around to kiss J.J., who gasped as she saw how toned Kelly had become in this short time.\nThe kiss quickly became more passionate, and apparently they got lost in it. Instead of turning back to the mirror to watch the final stages of the transformation, Kelly made her way towards their bed with J.J. in tow. They fell down on the bed, with Kelly first on top, but quickly they switched places as she let J.J. explore her body.\nHad Michelle not been focused on what happened inside their respective bodies she probably would have given them their privacy. She wondered if the two were even aware of her presence now.\nKelly didn\u0026rsquo;t notice that her muscles were done growing, as J.J. was occupied kissing and fondling her. What she did notice, however, was the pleasant surge that marked the last change to her appearance. With a smile she guided J.J.\u0026rsquo;s hands towards her breasts, and Michelle\u0026rsquo;s sister gladly focused her attention to them.\n\u0026ldquo;Oooh,\u0026rdquo; Kelly let out a loud moan as the sudden pleasure caught her off-guard. Michelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t blame her; the feeling of her breasts expanding was nice enough, but adding someone’s fondling of them is outright orgasmic. She still concentrated on the changes that had gone through Kelly, which was increasingly harder to do thanks to J.J.\u0026rsquo;s actions.\nThe moaning and growing continued for a bit until Kelly\u0026rsquo;s breasts had reached their final size, leaving her body in a very similar shape to Michelle\u0026rsquo;s own. From her estimation, Kelly ended up about an inch smaller than Michelle, but a hint more muscular in the process. Due to her being slightly smaller, her breasts looked a bit bigger on her than they did on Michelle, but one needed super senses to even notice differences on that scale. The biggest difference remained their hair color; Kelly\u0026rsquo;s was auburn as opposed to Michelle\u0026rsquo;s blonde. Interestingly, their eye color was matched, something new considering the bright orange or even golden eyes on Amanda and Susan respectively.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh … my… Go-o-o-o-o-d,\u0026rdquo; another moan accompanied the climax of her metamorphosis, as Kelly\u0026rsquo;s body was now infused with the super energy and all the powers it could use thanks to it. She rose from the bed, instinctively taking J.J. with her. For a second, Michelle was concerned about J.J.\u0026rsquo;s safety. As much as Kelly would love her sister, having her strength level explode from human to superhuman during an orgasm was dangerous for a mortal like J.J., but she had it covered. On a truly instinctive level, Kelly\u0026rsquo;s super energy entered J.J. to protect her from her own strength as she enjoyed the peak of her pleasure several feet above her bed.\n“I guess she has the power-sharing trick down already,” Michelle thought to herself.\n\u0026ldquo;So you think that the potion will be the solution to all your problems?\u0026rdquo; James asked.\nAfter the painful topic about Michelle\u0026rsquo;s and his argument, he had managed to bring the topic to Amanda\u0026rsquo;s recent experiences. From her own issues with her boyfriend, his hospitalization and how that had somehow managed to put them back together. This had ultimately led to her discovering the truth about his condition - and to their eventual engagement. The conversation then had returned to her plans to utilize the potion to save her fiancé\u0026rsquo;s life.\nSeeing that their conversation was getting dangerously close to going back to his issues with Michelle, he had tried to steer it into another direction with the aforementioned statement.\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; Amanda hesitated for a second, \u0026ldquo;if you put it that way, it sounds too good to be true, right? But if used correctly it can pretty well be.\u0026rdquo;\nHer confidence in the matter surprised him.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean ‘if used correctly’?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda took another sip of her Coke before answering. The fact that she had switched to non-alcoholic drinks before he had, despite her immunity to alcohol, hadn\u0026rsquo;t gone unnoticed.\n\u0026ldquo;If it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the potion I would still be single,\u0026rdquo; she began. \u0026ldquo;I would consider the man I love to be evil incarnate for having cheated on me with no clue as to why he did it and that his life had been on the line. No matter how much I regret hurting him, by making the best out of it I was able to learn the truth and reconnect with him. The powers helped there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just because the powers were helpful doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you couldn\u0026rsquo;t have managed to reconnect with him if you wanted to. From what I understood about your relationship, the actual problem was his secrecy.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda sighed. \u0026ldquo;And despite all the weird stuff that happened, it took his sister dying for him to come clean with me…. which tragically was also caused by the potion\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;See what I mean? Those who ingested the potion usually ended up worse than they started. She\u0026rsquo;s not the first to die because of that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Please tell me you didn\u0026rsquo;t say that to Michelle,\u0026rdquo; Amanda\u0026rsquo;s tone was getting more serious and the glare, with her flaming eye , made her several times more intimidating than she probably intended. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s aware that the changes to her body are so deeply rooted that she can\u0026rsquo;t be considered human anymore. Someone with her self-esteem shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be told that this is a bad thing!\u0026rdquo;\nNow it was James who sighed. Their conversation had gone full circle and returned to his argument with Michelle. Her words popped back up in his head. \u0026ldquo;I had hoped for a bit more support here,\u0026rdquo; she had said, and he felt guilty for not having provided it. Apparently all these feats of strength had made him overestimate Michelle. All he had done was call her out on her subconscious desire to have an equal partner and make her feel alone in the process.\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm, excuse me.\u0026rdquo; His train of thought was disturbed by an unfamiliar voice. Turning around, James saw a young Asian woman, probably around their age standing there, her eyes focused on Amanda.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah?\u0026rdquo; Amanda asked, obviously just as puzzled as he was.\nIt was pretty obvious why the woman addressed Amanda - her supernatural appearance stood out after all.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi, uhm\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; the woman stammered. \u0026ldquo;My name is Miu, and I … well\u0026hellip; uhm\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she held out her hand. \u0026ldquo;Pleased to meet you,\u0026rdquo; she finished.\nStill puzzled by the other woman\u0026rsquo;s nervousness, Amanda shook Miu\u0026rsquo;s hand, and her eyes went wide in the process. \u0026ldquo;I see,\u0026rdquo; she whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like to talk,\u0026rdquo; said Miu - apparently more confident now.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, definitely,\u0026rdquo; Amanda hastily said, gesturing for the other woman to have a seat. To James she whispered, \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s been super, too.\u0026rdquo;\nOnce Kelly\u0026rsquo;s transformation was completed, she remained hovering in midair, carrying J.J. along with her. Michelle was getting uncomfortable as the two lovers seemed to only have eyes for each other. Kelly was aroused because she just experienced her initial transformation - and Michelle knew that this was a moment to remember - while J.J. couldn\u0026rsquo;t get enough of her girlfriend’s new look.\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm, girls?\u0026rdquo; she spoke out loud, wondering if she should have taken the chance to leave them alone. She didn\u0026rsquo;t dare leave a newly transformed Kelly on her own, especially not with her sister.\nJ.J. however shot her a glare that pretty much screamed, \u0026ldquo;Couldn\u0026rsquo;t you leave us some privacy?!?\u0026rdquo; while Kelly\u0026rsquo;s expression was much friendlier. Lustful even. And this only served to increase J.J.\u0026rsquo;s irritation. Fortunately J.J. got over it rather quickly and blushed with embarrassment as she tried to get off Kelly. This proved harder than expected considering that the latter kept them a good foot above the bed.\nSensing J.J.\u0026rsquo;s trouble, Kelly brought them into a more upright position and put her back down onto the ground.\n\u0026ldquo;So, how does this work exactly?\u0026rdquo; Kelly asked as she hovered back towards the mirror. Her eyes went wide as she saw her new reflection for the first time. \u0026ldquo;Unbelievable,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;This is just too good to be true!\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle honestly wished it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. While it definitely had been informative to watch Kelly\u0026rsquo;s transformation with her improved senses, the consequences were quite substantial. After all, if she would sooner or later become stuck in her super form, this would also apply to any other super, Kelly included.\n\u0026ldquo;I honestly hadn\u0026rsquo;t intended for any of this to happen,\u0026rdquo; Michelle began, trying to find the right words, \u0026ldquo;but the changes to you are major. Nothing will be the same for you again.\u0026rdquo;\nThis brought Kelly down a peg. The tone of Michelle\u0026rsquo;s voice made it clear that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t all fun and games.\nThe three women went back to the living room where Michelle began her explanation of what the potion had done to Kelly. First, she decided to get her wardrobe back under control and was a bit disappointed when Kelly didn\u0026rsquo;t follow suit, only creating a bra and panties that made up the very basics of clothing. J.J., however didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to mind. And truth be told, Kelly\u0026rsquo;s supply of super energy was rather limited, so it actually made sense not to waste it.\nFor the second time tonight, Michelle went through the whole story, telling how her own transformation had been less than voluntary and how she had ended up as the world\u0026rsquo;s first superheroine - if the term applied. Kelly was surprisingly okay with the whole thing, even though Michelle made the downsides pretty obvious.\n\u0026ldquo;So the bad news is that I\u0026rsquo;m not technically human anymore, and thus can\u0026rsquo;t really reproduce with them? And that I\u0026rsquo;ll eventually get stuck in this incredible hot body? With super powers too boot? What\u0026rsquo;s the actual bad news then?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t forget the medical risk!\u0026rdquo; Michelle repeated. \u0026ldquo;One woman died of a drug overdose shortly after transforming back, another had a heart attack\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;… Due to a medical condition she had beforehand. A condition that I don\u0026rsquo;t share with her.\u0026rdquo; Kelly finished the sentence. \u0026ldquo;And for the record: I don\u0026rsquo;t do drugs either.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;By the way, didn\u0026rsquo;t you offer the stuff to me just before Kelly arrived?\u0026rdquo; J.J. interrupted.\nMichelle bit her lip. The conversation had a big resemblance to her argument with James - only that this time she was playing the role of James. Just like herself before, Kelly wasn\u0026rsquo;t really concerned about the downsides. She was aware of the risks - her constant turning to J.J. proved that - but the beneficial effects far outmatched them. Now that J.J. brought it up, she had desperately wished for her sister to see it as a good choice despite the risks too.\n\u0026ldquo;She did?\u0026rdquo; Kelly asked, surprised. \u0026ldquo;And what was your answer?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; J.J. seemed a bit embarrassed. \u0026ldquo;I actually said that I wanted to hear your opinion first.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d say go for it,\u0026rdquo; Kelly urged her on, and Michelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t really disagree. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d feel weird if you didn\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\nA smile grew on J.J.\u0026rsquo;s face. \u0026ldquo;Aw, sweetheart, we can\u0026rsquo;t have that can we?\u0026rdquo; Then turning to Michelle, she asked. \u0026ldquo;Does your offer still stand?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle hesitated for but a split second. A part of her wondered: what if the population of superhumans grew too quickly? But over the last two days it had become obvious that someone was going around turning people super. And Susan had shown what could happen if this power fell into the wrong hands. J.J. on the other hand, was one of the few people who Michelle could blindly trust with this. With a smile she answered.\n\u0026ldquo;How could I say no?\u0026rdquo;\nMiu only hesitantly came out with her story. So far all she had mentioned was that two days ago she had been in a bar with a few friends and had encountered a ridiculously handsome man who had been more interested in her than any of her friends.\n\u0026ldquo;Why do you think he picked you?\u0026rdquo; James asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; Miu blushed. \u0026ldquo;First I thought he was hired and my friends were merely pretending to be competing. But given what happened afterwards, I think he chose me because I was the most miserable of our group - hell in the whole bar - actually.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t belittle yourself,\u0026rdquo; Amanda interrupted. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re quite good-looking, even in your normal form.\u0026rdquo;\nShe was right, although everyone involved was aware that the transformation left some traces on the person\u0026rsquo;s normal appearance. Even Michelle had been improved compared to what she had been before.\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks,\u0026rdquo; Miu admitted. \u0026ldquo;But that\u0026rsquo;s not what I meant. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be ugly to be a miserable wreck.\u0026rdquo; Her head sunk a bit low as she said that. \u0026ldquo;Truth is that until two years ago I used to be a dancer. Whether it was ballet or hip-hop, I could pull off pretty much every dance there was. And I loved it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What happened?\u0026rdquo; Amanda dug further.\nObviously, the failed career story that was unfolding struck pretty close to home with her. James on the other hand was a bit more on edge.\n\u0026ldquo;I was paralyzed,\u0026rdquo; Miu exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;Through some dire twist of fate I lost my ability to walk or do anything with my legs, actually.\u0026rdquo; She took another sip of her Coke having vehemently declined any alcoholic drink.\n\u0026ldquo;Aww,\u0026rdquo; Amanda visibly fought the urge to hug her.\n\u0026ldquo;You can imagine how depressed I was when I was bound to a wheelchair since then. And two days ago was no different. Anyway, this hunk of a man asked me out, and despite my suspicions I left with him.\u0026rdquo; Miu blushed as she remembered the night. \u0026ldquo;And the outcome was simply unbelievable. I mean, one moment I was a plain, scrawny girl, unable to walk, and the next I was some larger-than-life goddess that didn\u0026rsquo;t need to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How exactly did that happen?\u0026rdquo; James interrupted. \u0026ldquo;Did he slip you something or make you drink anything?\u0026rdquo;\nMiu shook her head. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t drink anything. All we did was… have fun.\u0026rdquo; She blushed further. \u0026ldquo;And it happened after we were done.\u0026rdquo;\nJames slumped back. This was pretty much the same story Michelle had heard from Susan. No sign of the potion being consumed. Given that apparently a super woman\u0026rsquo;s milk could double as the potion as well, why should a male super’s sperm be any different? But then, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that mean he\u0026rsquo;d turn his partner into a relative?\n\u0026ldquo;It happened after you were done, you say. May I assume that you\u0026rsquo;d like to do it again with him if it gave you these powers once more?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh these powers have been great!\u0026rdquo; Miu exclaimed, but her expression became less and less enthusiastic about it. \u0026ldquo;But … I kinda don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it.\u0026rdquo; That last sentence was so full of surprise that it seemed she said it aloud to actually realize it on her own.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean, you don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it?\u0026rdquo; Amanda asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t understand. Having these powers felt great. But to sleep with him again to gain them\u0026hellip; I mean that was the best sex I ever had and still\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The confusion in her voice was steadily increasing.\n\u0026ldquo;I think I know why you feel that way. Since he transformed you, you now consider him a family member. And thus you don\u0026rsquo;t feel attracted to him anymore.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Y-you mean that superpowers are like some kind of STD?\u0026rdquo; Miu now seemed concerned.\n\u0026ldquo;At least when the man is super,\u0026rdquo; Amanda commented. Obviously she had figured it out as well. \u0026ldquo;As for the other way around, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be the case.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good,\u0026rdquo; Miu let out a sigh of relief. \u0026ldquo;Last thing I wanted was to spread it around.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026quot; What do you mean by that?\u0026quot; James asked. \u0026ldquo;Were you with others while you were super?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d rather not talk about that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why not? Didn\u0026rsquo;t it go well? Trust me, we won\u0026rsquo;t judge.\u0026rdquo; Amanda promised. \u0026ldquo;We all make mistakes after all.\u0026rdquo;\nJames however wasn\u0026rsquo;t so sure about that. \u0026ldquo;It would help a lot to hear all you\u0026rsquo;ve been through.\u0026rdquo;\nMiu looked at them nervously. \u0026ldquo;Alright, but I\u0026rsquo;ll have to give you a bit more background first.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure that stuff is actually milk and not some fluorescent liquid?\u0026rdquo; Kelly commented when she saw the bottle.\n\u0026ldquo;You only see the super energy inside it, which is why you think it glows. But for anybody else it doesn\u0026rsquo;t glow at all,\u0026rdquo; Michelle explained.\n\u0026ldquo;Then this bottle contains more power than both our bodies combined!\u0026rdquo; Kelly exclaimed.\nMichelle had to agree. She had powered-down so that she could transform back to normal, so the majority of her power had gone into that bottle. As for Kelly, her energy supply was even less, because she had only absorbed what little potion had entered her blood stream.\nAs for J.J. who couldn\u0026rsquo;t see that difference in power, she was quite shocked to hear that. She sat staring at the bottle in her hands second-guessing her own decision.\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm, Michelle?\u0026rdquo; she began. \u0026ldquo;Could you give us some… uhm… privacy?\u0026rdquo;\nThat wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly what she had expected, but, given how she had felt out of place during the final stages of Kelly\u0026rsquo;s ascension, Michelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t argue here. Things would probably get steamy here.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, I\u0026rsquo;ll take my leave then. Don\u0026rsquo;t drink it all at once, and try not to cause too much destruction.\u0026rdquo; She said before giving J.J. a goodbye hug. \u0026ldquo;And thanks for your comfort.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Any time, Sis. And don\u0026rsquo;t worry; if he\u0026rsquo;s the right one he\u0026rsquo;ll come around. You just have to give him time to get to know you better.\u0026rdquo;\nOnce they were done, Michelle made her way to the window and gave the couple one last look before she took to the night sky.\nComing to a stop high above the city, Michelle tried to sort things out for herself. The whole deal with Kelly had distracted her from her own little problem. She wondered how James would react when he learned that she had created two new supergirls. He probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like it at all. With a sigh she began her trip home, the landscape becoming a blur under her as she picked up the pace.\nMiu\u0026rsquo;s story turned out to be much more dramatic than Amanda had expected. The young Asian woman told them about how she had lost her ability to walk. She had been at the wrong side street at the wrong time and encountered the wrong man there. He pulled out a knife, raped her and - as if that wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad enough - had stabbed her several times in the back while he did it. Afterwards he left her for dead, but Miu survived and was found. She was unable to identify the man who did it and, thanks to the injuries he had inflicted, she was paralyzed from the waist down.\nAmanda fought back tears as she heard the story. Saturday night, when Michelle had showed off her powers to her, someone had tried to rape her as well. Unlike Miu, Michelle had been far more than that man could\u0026rsquo;ve handled and easily took care of him. As far as Amanda knew, her best friend had stopped more than one attempted rape in the meantime. But two years ago, Miu didn\u0026rsquo;t have that kind of power - or luck, for that matter.\nTaking her hand, Amanda asked the question she didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to hear the answer to.\n\u0026ldquo;What did you do when you had this power?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Revenge,\u0026rdquo; Miu flatly stated. \u0026ldquo;I tracked him down and repeated our little encounter. Only this time, when he tried to stab me in the back, he didn\u0026rsquo;t even make a scratch.\u0026rdquo; She held up the mangled remains of a knife. \u0026ldquo;My skin was stronger than steel, and my thighs more powerful than his bones. He\u0026rsquo;s alive, but he won\u0026rsquo;t be able to hurt anybody again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;ll never be able to walk again,\u0026rdquo; James commented. \u0026ldquo;Quite extreme for revenge. If you found him that quickly, why didn\u0026rsquo;t you call the police?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t know how it felt like to be broken - to have nothing worth living for - and then suddenly being able to do whatever you want.\u0026rdquo; Miu blurted out this part, her emotions getting the better of her. \u0026ldquo;I … suddenly knew how to find him. It was strange, all that time I had cursed the fact that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to see his face, and then I am capable of sensing him halfway across town. Even when I found him, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure until he tried to stab me during the act.\u0026rdquo; She looked at her drink as if in deep though, obviously going through the scene in her mind, her eyes glassy. \u0026ldquo;When all you have to do is flex your thighs, you don\u0026rsquo;t wait and call the police. I had no proof anyway, at least none that they would\u0026rsquo;ve accepted. I\u0026rsquo;m not proud of what I did, but it gives me closure.\u0026rdquo; Tears were now running down her cheeks. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve never hurt anybody like this before.\u0026rdquo;\nIf what she said was true, this guy truly had it coming. And Amanda wasn\u0026rsquo;t really in the position to judge anyway. She herself had put her boyfriend into the hospital shortly after becoming super. Hers may have been an accident, but she could understand how Miu, who suffered a lot more than her, saw it fit to dish out justice. And still\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;d suggest that you take this to the police if you really want closure. I know the officer leading the investigation actually, so I could arrange things to go as smooth as possible for you. What I\u0026rsquo;m more interested in is how you managed to track him down all over town. How exactly did this work?\u0026rdquo; James tried to change the topic.\nAmanda doubted that Jacob and Deziree would return anytime soon. The former would obviously be quite interested in the story.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. It was like I felt where he was. After figuring out I was super strong, I thought about getting even with him and then … it was like I had a supernatural radar going or something like that. I just knew in which direction he was, and when I found him, he made it easy for me to confirm it was really him.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see. Did it feel like you were straining to do that? I mean sensing someone over the town could be relatively easy to do. Maybe you could do it right now if you tried?\u0026rdquo;\nMiu shook her head. \u0026ldquo;I lost all super powers mere moments after getting my revenge. Which is a good thing, actually. As nice as they were, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any use for them anymore. Being plain old me again was all that I wished for.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not plain old you again,\u0026rdquo; Amanda interfered. \u0026ldquo;I could tell that you had these powers merely by touching you, and so can any other super regardless of whether or not they have powers at the moment. Long story short, you\u0026rsquo;re a different being altogether, and given enough time, these powers might return on their own.\u0026rdquo;\nMiu\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened, the gravity of the situation becoming clear to her. Amanda felt bad about having told her, and wondered if she should really go into detail about how exactly these changes worked. The poor girl had no idea that the changes tracked back to an alien plant after all.\n\u0026ldquo;This is … are you sure about that?\u0026rdquo; she whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know about a case where it fully happened yet, but we’ve had both a woman that stayed in her enhanced appearance while losing her powers, and one that was starting to be able to use them while in her normal form. In short the powers aren\u0026rsquo;t gone, you\u0026rsquo;re just lacking the energy to use them. Eventually your body should find a way to generate it on your own.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;W-wait wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that mean I\u0026rsquo;ll be stuck as Amazon-me then?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Most likely.\u0026rdquo;\nMiu looked down her body as if to mentally compare it with her super form. \u0026ldquo;Wow\u0026hellip; I hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected to hear something like that\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda took her hand. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you\u0026rsquo;re in good company. We may not know everything about what is happening to us, but we\u0026rsquo;ll get to the bottom of it eventually. After all, we have scientists like James working on it.\u0026rdquo;\nMiu turned to James. \u0026ldquo;Really? There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of research going on about this?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t put it that way. Of course, we are trying to research this phenomenon, but we\u0026rsquo;re lacking actual research cases. So far we only have a bunch of dead women to perform an autopsy on. It\u0026rsquo;s not like superpowered women are too eager to be guinea pigs. In fact the last superwomen who entered the lab caused a lot of property damage during their … argument. With a bit of luck the loser may be convinced to help us out from now on.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see,\u0026rdquo; Miu exclaimed before turning to Amanda again. \u0026ldquo;How about you? Are you helping there as well?\u0026rdquo;\nThat was a good question. \u0026ldquo;Uhm, actually not. But now that you mention it, maybe I should consider lending a hand in the future. What do you think, James?\u0026rdquo;\nJames looked at her like she had just decided to eat a baby for dinner. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not serious, are you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why not? You just said yourself that you only have corpses to work on and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that I\u0026rsquo;d be a bigger asset than you-know-who. Plus, how better to get the necessary information about my fiancé\u0026rsquo;s problems than at your facility?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can hardly see you cooperating with the lead expert on the subject. Didn\u0026rsquo;t you hate him? And doesn\u0026rsquo;t he hate your fiancé, for that matter?\u0026rdquo;\nHe definitely had a point here. The idea of cooperating with Prof. Harland of all people made her stomach twist. But Amanda had higher priorities.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not doing this for my sake. And I\u0026rsquo;m willing to go quite far for my fiancé.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm,\u0026rdquo; Miu fiddled with her hands nervously. \u0026ldquo;W-what kind of tests are we talking about? Would it help if I volunteered, too?\u0026rdquo;\nHalf an hour later, James returned to his place. What had started out as an attempt to get superpowered women out of his head had far too quickly turned into the very opposite. The good news was that the mystery Asian had not only presented herself, but also seemed a lot nicer than her victim’s state had implied. The bad news was that supers were popping up at an alarming rate now. What would happen if that went on for much longer? He didn\u0026rsquo;t dare to think about it.\nThe closer he got to his apartment the less he thought about the other superwomen and the more he thought about the first he\u0026rsquo;d met of them. It didn\u0026rsquo;t surprise him in the least that he saw light coming from his apartment. He already knew that Michelle was there and had been for quite a while. The strange mental connection between them made it hard not to know where she was. Opening the door, he heard the water running in the shower. That gave him a bit more time to figure out what to say.\nOne thing that quickly struck him was the hole Michelle had created during their argument. Or rather the fact that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t there anymore. Michelle had been true to her word and fixed it. Which was why she took a shower now. Something told him her previous shower wasn\u0026rsquo;t that long ago.\nThe water stopped running, and shortly thereafter Michelle hovered into the room. James gulped as he saw her. With her body still in her super form, dressed only in a towel and slightly wet everywhere else, he could barely string together a coherent thought at this sight. One thing was sure though: After talking to equally-enhanced Amanda and Deziree, it was still Michelle that utterly blew his mind.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi,\u0026rdquo; she whispered, blushing slightly at the effect she had upon him.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey,\u0026rdquo; he answered just as awkwardly, stepping towards her. He felt a constant urge to rip that towel off her body, but right now a hug would do.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry about earlier,\u0026rdquo; she continued. \u0026ldquo;I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t stand the feeling of you disagreeing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Shh\u0026hellip; no harm done,\u0026rdquo; he answered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m the one who has to apologize. I should\u0026rsquo;ve known that the whole situation isn\u0026rsquo;t as easy for you, either.\u0026rdquo;\nThey continued to hug each other in silence for well over a minute, before Michelle spoke up again.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve made a huge mistake. My sister and her girlfriend\u0026hellip; they\u0026rsquo;re super now, too,\u0026rdquo; she all but cried as she whispered that.\n\u0026ldquo;How did that happen?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let me show you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nOnce again Michelle flooded his head with information. About how her sister’s girlfriend had accidentally stepped into the potion Michelle had originally intended for him to drink. When it came to her transformation, the whole thing seemed to happen in slow motion, with different overlaying images that he could barely register all together. His head hurt trying to process the sudden information overflow that Michelle had stored in her memory.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed as the vision ended. \u0026ldquo;Seeing things from your perspective is indeed something else.\u0026rdquo;\nHe could hardly be mad at her for making a mistake, not after this kind of vision. Any scientist would kill having this kind of view when the process was at work - even though he could barely process it. Maybe his opinion was biased by the fact that the information management at the lab was abyssal, but this whole link to Michelle and her supernatural perception was becoming his outright favorite powers.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad you see it that way,\u0026rdquo; she whispered. \u0026ldquo;After all, these are my personal powers.\u0026rdquo;\nJames eyes widened. He knew about those - Amanda\u0026rsquo;s heat vision, Ms. Riley\u0026rsquo;s ability to create permanent clothes, Ms. Harland’s mind control, Deziree\u0026rsquo;s invisibility and Miu\u0026rsquo;s super radar ability - but none could hold a candle against Michelle\u0026hellip; at least not for him.\nEven though they were staring into each other\u0026rsquo;s eyes, he could practically feel her smile grow brighter as he came to that conclusion. After all, from what they had learned, these powers seemed to be at least partially affected by the user\u0026rsquo;s personality. Simply put, the fact that he loved Michelle\u0026rsquo;s personal powers more than any other was a subtle sign that he loved her as well. Not that he needed that hint.\n\u0026ldquo;If you like it that much, how about I show you even more? So far I only gave you small glimpses of what I\u0026rsquo;ve done until now, and in my depowered state no less. Wanna see how Amanda\u0026rsquo;s second transformation looked in slow motion? I think I could even make it easier for you to understand this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How would that work?\u0026rdquo; James almost expected her to suggest drinking the potion to solve that issue.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course not. For some reason, I made a link to the plant that gave me these powers. Even though it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any brain or intelligence of it\u0026rsquo;s own, I could share part of my brain for it to use. If I do the same with you, you should be able to perceive things the same way I did without getting a headache.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You never cease to amaze me. I probably won\u0026rsquo;t get such a detailed view on a transformation of yours, would I?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not a third person view, no. At least not without the same kind of powers. But I could share with you the detailed memory of how it felt to me. Last time I only gave you a rough version.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You really wanna do this do you? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we talk about our little disagreement first? \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;Correct me if I\u0026rsquo;m wrong, but your main issue with taking the potion and becoming super is that you\u0026rsquo;d settle with me, and feel that we don\u0026rsquo;t know each other enough for that kind of commitment. Through our bond, I already know you a lot better than I should after such a short time, but it seems like you don\u0026rsquo;t know me as well. Apparently the bond works better for me, so it\u0026rsquo;s only fair to let you catch up.\u0026rdquo;\nJames couldn\u0026rsquo;t argue with that. She was right. If she really could read him like that all the time, then she would know him a lot better than he did her. Balancing things out would be the only plausible solution, no matter how he looked at it.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a point there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good. Then let\u0026rsquo;s lie down for this; I\u0026rsquo;ll need my whole concentration.\u0026rdquo;\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be asked twice. Not a minute later, they were lying in his bed, her on top of him, partially floating, her eyes glowing bright before\u0026hellip;.\nJames suddenly found himself standing in a white space. Michelle hovered naked in front of him and he noticed that he was naked as well.\n\u0026ldquo;What is this?\u0026rdquo; He thought it to himself, but found his mouth asking the question out loud.\n\u0026ldquo;Some kind of mental meeting place,\u0026rdquo; Michelle answered. \u0026ldquo;I used it to talk to the plant, but it took me a while to realize just who I was really talking to. Anyway, this space enables me to share my memories in the most effective way. Is there anything you would like to see first?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, actually. There are so many things I want to know about you that I can\u0026rsquo;t decide where to start. Maybe you could decide where to start?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, then; how about I start small and show you how I found the seed that changed my life?\u0026rdquo;\nHe nodded and the white space disappeared, to be replaced by the streets of the city. Somewhere downtown; a usual place for Michelle to go on a walk. James noticed that the images were blurry at times, especially the faces of the people walking around. That was only logical considering this was Michelle\u0026rsquo;s memory from three months ago. While she had a clear knowledge about the buildings here, she had not paid too much attention to the people around her. Except\u0026hellip;\nOne man going in the opposite direction stuck out. Unlike the others, he was clearly visible, meaning that Michelle had bothered remembering him. A sudden wave of animosity came over him and as he wondered whether he was getting jealous of this guy, he noticed that this was actually part of Michelle\u0026rsquo;s memory.\nThey passed each other, and past Michelle gave him an aside-glance. “At least pretend to recognize me, asshole!”\u0026hellip; James could hear her thoughts from back then clearly. Unfortunately her attention would have been better spent on the pavement, as she suddenly slipped and fell on her back.\n\u0026ldquo;Ouch,\u0026rdquo; he heard Michelle exclaim as she landed. The people around her, commenting her misfortune with a slight laugh, but generally not paying her too much mind. The man however, turned around and laughed wholeheartedly.\n\u0026ldquo;You better watch your step,\u0026rdquo; he joked before a loud growl made him grab his stomach.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; And you better watch your food,\u0026rdquo; Michelle countered. \u0026ldquo;Apparently your last meal was from before the evacuation.\u0026rdquo;\nWith gritted teeth the man turned around, and with hasty steps was probably about to find the next bathroom. James felt Michelle\u0026rsquo;s mood lighten.\u0026ldquo;Well, there really is a God,\u0026rdquo; he heard her think before she noticed just what she had tripped over. Before her lay a small, brown almond-shaped object. Michelle picked it up and figured it must be some kind of seed. Given that this was the first day after the evacuation ended, Michelle decided just then and there to plant it as a memento of that day. Just to see what kind of plant it was.\nThe white space returned, as the memory was over now.\n\u0026ldquo;The rest is easily explained, I planted the seed, it grew into the plant you\u0026rsquo;ve seen at my nightstand, and it produced a liquid that turned me into this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about the man you met there? You seemed to hate him.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle averted her gaze.\n\u0026ldquo;Let me guess, he was an ex-boyfriend of yours.\u0026rdquo; James said.\nThe blonde amazon shook her head. \u0026ldquo;That would be giving him far too much credit. He was just a one-night stand. And it was my own mistake to believe we would be more than that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry to hear that,\u0026rdquo; James walked over to hug her.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s okay. He was an episode of the past, but you are the present.\u0026rdquo; Michelle blushed as she added, \u0026ldquo;And the future.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You wanted me to get to know you better, how about you show me how it went with him?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened, yet her blush didn\u0026rsquo;t disappear. \u0026ldquo;Y-you sure about that? That wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a good episode of my life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which is exactly why I want to see it,\u0026rdquo; James answered. \u0026ldquo;You already gave me glimpses of your heroic deeds, showing how great you can be. But for us to work as a couple, I will also have to know your bad sides, and who knows? Maybe I like what you consider these bad sides?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle gulped, but nodded. \u0026ldquo;That would be great. OK, I\u0026rsquo;ll show you.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so she did. For the next few hours Michelle did nothing but show James episodes of her life. True to her word she gave him full disclosure, a leap of faith that dwarfed everything she had done so far.\nThe night at the hospital felt a lot less lonely than the day for Fred. The news that his sister had died had been more of a shock than he had expected. He thought he had been mentally prepared for this to happen. That Amanda had been digging in this very wound hadn\u0026rsquo;t helped there, especially due to the changes she had gone through these last few days. On the other hand, the very fact that she was still there for him had kept him sane for now. After all, the reason Erika died even before her time was that she, for a short time, had the same kind of powers as Amanda had.\nAt least that\u0026rsquo;s what Amanda had told him earlier today, when everything had become clearer – yet so much more complicated. Now they were engaged, something he hadn\u0026rsquo;t even dreamed possible. His problems hadn\u0026rsquo;t decreased: he still had a ruined knee and a heart that would fail in a few years. Still, it felt comforting that Amanda knew about that now. When she had exclaimed that they would solve these problems, he had believed her. Had it been because of her new powers? Of these abilities that defied explanation?\nFred felt compelled to look outside – and wasn\u0026rsquo;t surprised as he saw a figure just outside the window, a woman with a long red mane and glowing orange eyes opening the window from the outside. What surprised him was that Amanda\u0026rsquo;s outfit was a lot more casual than her last one when she had come here in her super form. Not that he was complaining about the tight jeans and the sexy top, but he remembered her mentioning that her ability to create clothes wouldn\u0026rsquo;t allow an outfit like that.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s been a present of sorts,\u0026rdquo; Amanda whispered as if to answer his thoughts directly.\n\u0026ldquo;From who?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda\u0026rsquo;s face darkened a bit. \u0026ldquo;Erika,\u0026rdquo; she whispered again. \u0026ldquo;This was her individual power that she passed on to me. Remember when I told you about the little fight we had because she didn\u0026rsquo;t know it was me? She gave me some of her energy and apparently a boost for the whole clothes creation ability.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are full of surprises,\u0026rdquo; Fred exclaimed.\n\u0026ldquo;And I haven\u0026rsquo;t even started yet,\u0026rdquo; Amanda giggled, placing her hand on his knee.\nFred expected the pain to instantly go away – like always when Amanda did that. But this time she seemed to be trying something different. Instead of disappearing, the pain actually got worse – and he could see the strain on her face.\nAfter about a minute, she gasped and stopped whatever she was trying. \u0026ldquo;Alright… the whole healing power part\u0026hellip; will take a bit longer. But it looks like I made some progress on that front. If I can keep it up, you\u0026rsquo;ll be walking by the weekend.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t believe it if it weren\u0026rsquo;t you saying that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aww,\u0026rdquo; Amanda leaned in for a kiss, which he gladly returned. \u0026ldquo;Like I said, I have some news for you. There\u0026rsquo;s good news, bad news, and important news. Which one would you like to hear first?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s start with bad news. I have a feeling it won\u0026rsquo;t be the worst news I hear today.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You may be right. Still, the fact that Susan Harland became super too is definitely bad news.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Please tell me you are kidding.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda shook her head. \u0026ldquo;Which bring me to the good news: Michelle took care of her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Michelle? Oh I get it: she\u0026rsquo;s the one who saved Erika back then\u0026hellip; shouldn\u0026rsquo;t you have tried to keep that to yourself?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nope. She told her boyfriend about me, so why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t I tell my fiancé? Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, she\u0026rsquo;ll be fine with you knowing.\u0026rdquo;\nFred rolled his eyes. \u0026ldquo;Of course she will! She\u0026rsquo;s way too trusting at times. Remember that one guy she hooked up with thinking it was her soulmate? Didn\u0026rsquo;t go beyond a one-night stand, if I remember correctly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Would you rather have her be bitter and disillusioned about it? Sure, she\u0026rsquo;s been quite trusting and leaves herself wide open at times. But the way she\u0026rsquo;s willing to believe in people is what makes her so good at helping them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t argue with that.\u0026rdquo; Actually Fred didn\u0026rsquo;t know Michelle well enough to actually argue at all. \u0026ldquo;I just hope she\u0026rsquo;s not in over her head. If these superpowers are popping up that frequently, it would be best if the poster girl remained one of the good guys.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, if worse comes to worse, I\u0026rsquo;ll talk some sense into her,\u0026rdquo; Amanda exclaimed as she slid under the blanket. Her clothes dissolved into thin air, leaving her in only a bra and panties. They kissed again, slowly.\n\u0026ldquo;So what is the important news?\u0026rdquo; Fred asked. He knew he was rushing things here, but, with her so close, his rational mind was eager to take a vacation.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you did hear that these powers come with a significant mutation that basically turns me half-alien, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; he nodded. That train of thought made it easier for him to remain focused, though.\n\u0026ldquo;As you can probably imagine, the different number of chromosomes makes it pretty much impossible to reproduce\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nFred gulped. \u0026ldquo;I-if you want to tell me that you can\u0026rsquo;t have children, then it\u0026rsquo;s okay. All I remember about my parents is that they died far too early, and that both Erika and I had inherited their condition. I don\u0026rsquo;t really like the idea that my kids would suffer a similar fate, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really high on my agenda to have any.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda\u0026rsquo;s face darkened – due to her eyes not glowing as bright anymore. \u0026ldquo;Well, I fully intend to fix that little condition of yours. And actually, you turning into a half-alien hybrid like myself would be part of my agenda, too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t I die just like Erika?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m still trying to figure out a way to prevent that. So far the best lead would be Susan. Apparently she didn\u0026rsquo;t transform back to normal after she was out of power. That could be the key to saving you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see. I don’t know too much about these powers of yours, so I\u0026rsquo;ll trust you on that. If you think you found a way to cure me, I\u0026rsquo;ll go along with it. Even if it means to go down the road that killed my sister.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And the becoming half-alien part wouldn\u0026rsquo;t bother you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You still look and act pretty human, so it can\u0026rsquo;t be that bad. Besides, if this really cures me, then this would apply to any children of ours too, right? In that case we could really start a family!\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda simply smiled at him, her eyes shining bright again, maybe even brighter than they did originally. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad you see it that way.\u0026rdquo; She then picked his hand and placed it on her belly. \u0026ldquo;Because it seems like we already started our family.\u0026rdquo;\nHis eyes widened. Hadn\u0026rsquo;t she just claimed that she couldn\u0026rsquo;t get pregnant from him due to being super?\n\u0026ldquo;That’s right,\u0026rdquo; she once again answered his very thoughts. \u0026ldquo;But apparently I was already pregnant when I drank the potion….\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That was… something else,\u0026rdquo; James exclaimed when the bond broke.\nMichelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t really disagree, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like answering right now. Enabling James to look this deep into her soul had taken its toll and used up the rest of her super energy. And as her body returned to it\u0026rsquo;s normal state, the exhaustion hit her like a train. From one moment to the next the bond was gone, and they barely had gotten to the good stuff.\nWhat was left was a feeling of loneliness she hadn\u0026rsquo;t felt for several days. The fact that she was now in her plain state didn\u0026rsquo;t help at all. She fought back tears and turned away from him.\n\u0026ldquo;Is everything alright?\u0026rdquo; James asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, everything is fine,\u0026rdquo; she pouted.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a bad liar.\u0026rdquo; He came closer. \u0026ldquo;Are you hurt?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, just exhausted. I\u0026rsquo;ve been up for quite a while, you know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That makes it two of us.\u0026rdquo; He hugged her from behind. \u0026ldquo;Still, that\u0026rsquo;s not what it is, right?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle almost shivered. Right now she felt very self-conscious. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected things to get that… private. After taking the leap of faith of showing him the mistakes of her past, she had intended to make it up by showing him all the incredible things she had done after her transformation. The problem was that even she wasn\u0026rsquo;t proud of them.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just a naïve fool that happened to be extremely lucky, am I not?\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;What? You\u0026rsquo;re not a fool! What makes you think that way?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle sighed. \u0026ldquo;All the things I did with these powers, they weren\u0026rsquo;t that much to speak of.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not true! You saved people after all!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I only delayed things for Erika! I didn\u0026rsquo;t save her at all. In fact she was already safe when I interfered. I only made things worse.\u0026rdquo; After everything that had happened today, this was still the harsh reality.\n\u0026ldquo;You made a mistake, fixed it, and learned from it. That\u0026rsquo;s a win in my book. And I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean Erika, there were others, too.\u0026rdquo;\nThe image of the young girl popped up in her head. \u0026ldquo;Everybody can jump into the flames or catch a bullet when they are invulnerable,\u0026rdquo; she sadly announced. \u0026ldquo;Nothing special about me doing that then.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more wrong!\u0026rdquo; James almost shouted. \u0026ldquo;After all, you did it, not someone else. By now we know that there\u0026rsquo;s someone passing around these powers, yet none of them has done anything like you did. Sure, you may be lucky to have found the seed, but of the five supers I met today, you\u0026rsquo;re the only one who’s helped anybody. Actually you\u0026rsquo;re the only one who didn\u0026rsquo;t use her powers to hurt or steal at all!\u0026rdquo;\nThat comforted her a bit. Being the one out of five did raise her confidence a bit.\n\u0026ldquo;Besides,\u0026rdquo; James continued. \u0026ldquo;Given that you were the one that was all over the news today, it may the reason things change in the future. If someone gets these powers in the near future, they will be reminded of you and either follow your example or at least refrain from causing trouble out of fear you might deal with them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aww,\u0026rdquo; Michelle turned around to face him again. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re just saying that to cheer me up!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m serious. You\u0026rsquo;re carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, and you\u0026rsquo;re past the point where you can bail out easily. So I figured you need all the support you can get\u0026hellip; and I\u0026rsquo;m terribly sorry to not have given it to you right away earlier.\u0026rdquo;\nHe leaned in for a kiss that somehow helped to wash all her bad feelings away. Despite her weakened state, she could feel their connection again. And through that connection she could hear one thought loud and clear:\nIf she asks me again, I won\u0026rsquo;t say no.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part15/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 15"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"Deziree turned around to spot a woman hovering there. She wore a black catsuit with red and orange flames on it that seemed to flow straight into the boots she wore.\nThat outfit only enhanced the long red hair and the glowing orange eyes as well as the proportions that were almost identical to Deziree\u0026rsquo;s own. If she had to describe this woman with one word, it would definitely be \u0026lsquo;hot\u0026rsquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm\u0026hellip;thanks,\u0026rdquo; Deziree answered shyly. From what she had heard about this woman, she had hospitalized a man she had encountered. The good news was that the victim claimed it to be an accident. But Deziree had no way of knowing if that was true, so she kept her guard up. After all, the other woman could probably see what was inside the containers. Unfortunately the redhead seemed to have more of the super energy inside her than Deziree did right now.\n\u0026ldquo;No need to belittle yourself,\u0026rdquo; the other woman said with a slightly warmer voice. \u0026ldquo;This is the fanciest dress I\u0026rsquo;ve seen that was created this way. It shows that you have a certain talent. Say, what should I call you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d rather keep my name a secret,\u0026rdquo; Deziree answered immediately. After her encounter with the guard just now, she found it hard to believe this woman\u0026rsquo;s friendly voice\u0026hellip;not while she carried something with her that the other woman probably wanted.\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t ask for your real name, did I? By the way, you can call me Devil.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not exactly the friendliest name there is. But it kinda fits.\u0026rdquo; Now Deziree tried to figure out a name she could give in return. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t really thought about a codename of the likes of Angel or Devil and actually wondered if the former had done such a thing. The media obviously named her because of the wings she had materialized to carry the plane after all. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t really think of a name right now,\u0026rdquo; she admitted.\n\u0026ldquo;Hm?\u0026rdquo; The redhead raised her brow. \u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s not that important actually. But I\u0026rsquo;d like to ask you a few other questions. Would you answer them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That depends on the question.\u0026rdquo; Deziree was still on the fence about this woman. She was nice and polite, but maybe that was only because she thought she had the upper hand? Then again this was an opportunity to get some answers herself. \u0026ldquo;Actually, I also have some questions about you. How about we take turns?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fair enough. You can start if you want.\u0026rdquo;\nNow this was a surprise. The redhead let her start? Deziree hoped that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a trick to make her trust the other woman. After the rotten guard, she could really use someone to restore her faith in humanity. \u0026ldquo;How did you get these powers?\u0026rdquo;\nThe redhead sighed. \u0026ldquo;Straight to the chase, huh? Well since I\u0026rsquo;m going to ask you the same it\u0026rsquo;s only fair, I guess. My best friend got her hands on some of the stuff that\u0026rsquo;s probably in those containers you carry and shared it with me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How did she get it?\u0026rdquo; Deziree asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Wait, first you\u0026rsquo;ll have to answer me my question. How did you get these powers?\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree sighed. \u0026ldquo;Some superpowered bitch tried to kill me, got her hands on one of these containers, drank a great deal of it, and started leaking milk. The Angel interfered, kicked the bitches' ass while I managed to sneak some of the milk away, and you can guess the rest.\u0026rdquo;\nDevil\u0026rsquo;s orange eyes widened. \u0026ldquo;Interesting. Your turn again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How did your friend get this stuff? Did she have another person who gave it to her? Or does she have a plant that produces it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s got her own plant. So the milk you drank came from another super? Where did her powers come from? These containers, or somewhere else?\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree shrugged. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. She seemed unaware of the stuffs effects until she drank it, but I can\u0026rsquo;t rule out that she got her powers through this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Understandable. Well, your turn again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is your best friend the Angel?\u0026rdquo;\nFor a second, Devil glared at her, but her expression softened right away. \u0026ldquo;Guess there\u0026rsquo;s no use hiding it: Yes. My turn again: Where did those containers come from?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I … uhm kinda stole them.\u0026rdquo; Deziree admitted sheepishly. \u0026ldquo;And if the Angel is really your best friend she knows from where.\u0026rdquo; Or who I am, she thought to herself. \u0026ldquo;What kinds of abilities do we all possess? It\u0026rsquo;s kind of a hassle figuring everything out myself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; Devil hesitated. \u0026ldquo;The whole thing is a bit more complicated. From what I understand there\u0026rsquo;s some basic abilities we gained through drinking the potion. From what I understand abilities like flight, invulnerability, energy-absorption and the ability to create this cloth-like material come straight from the plant that produced the potion, while other abilities like super strength, super senses, X-ray vision and super pheromones are basically just enhancements of normal human abilities. Anything else seems kind of individual.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean by that?\u0026rdquo;\nDevil looked at her, unsure about whether or not to protest about this follow-up question. She decided to answer instead. \u0026ldquo;From what I understand we can use the aforementioned powers on an instinctive level, but it is also possible to figure out other abilities for yourself. And you can actually share these abilities with other supers by absorbing their super energy, so they\u0026rsquo;re not really exclusive although they seem to be affected by one\u0026rsquo;s personality.\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, my turn: What power that I didn\u0026rsquo;t mention do you possess?\u0026rdquo; Devil continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm,\u0026rdquo; Deziree pondered her answer. While invisibility would be the honest answer, she actually had some choices here. She had at least three abilities that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be among the standard set Devil had mentioned. The question was which one was hers? Well, mind control was obviously Susan\u0026rsquo;s trick. That woman was so accustomed of getting what she wanted, that this power fit her far too well. That left heat vision and invisibility. And it was just as obvious that the latter fit for plain, shy unnoticeable Deziree.\n\u0026ldquo;I can shoot lasers out of my eyes,\u0026rdquo; Deziree answered.\nDevil\u0026rsquo;s face could barely contain her surprise. \u0026ldquo;First the dress and now that,\u0026rdquo; she muttered to herself. \u0026ldquo;What else?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What makes you think there is more?\u0026rdquo; Deziree countered, wondering what that had to do with her dress.\nInstead of answering, Devil held up her arm, looked at it and suddenly fired two beams of light onto it – beams that didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt her in the least. \u0026ldquo;Heat vision is kind of my thing. And actually your dress is too fancy for it to be created with the basic fabric creation, so I think you got an enhancement on that just like I did. It probably won\u0026rsquo;t even disappear once you transform back.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Y-you said that these powers can be shared quite easily,\u0026rdquo; Deziree stammered, her mind racing. She remembered how she had absorbed the energy from the bandage the Angel had given her. Apparently she had gotten all the Angel\u0026rsquo;s abilities along with it. \u0026ldquo;So you gave the Angel your powers…\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed. And apparently she gave them to you in turn,\u0026rdquo; Devil concluded.\nDeziree let out a sigh of relief. This confirmed that Devil was indeed a friend of the Angel. After the guard that had tried to lie to her before, it mean a lot that this woman spoke the truth. Then it hit her: She had absorbed the Angels powers\u0026hellip; the same Angel that had easily defeated Susan earlier today.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow\u0026hellip; I didn\u0026rsquo;t look at it this way,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed.\n\u0026ldquo;So, what extra powers do you have?\u0026rdquo; Devil repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I can turn invisible,\u0026rdquo; Deziree admitted, before remembering that Devil would probably learn about Susan\u0026rsquo;s ability if she asked the Angel. \u0026ldquo;And I kinda have mind control powers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mind control?\u0026rdquo; Devil seemed intrigued. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s sounds dangerous.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; Deziree nodded. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s from the woman whose milk I drank and\u0026hellip; let\u0026rsquo;s just say she didn\u0026rsquo;t notice what she was actually capable of. Thank goodness\u0026hellip;she wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly subtle. Who knows what she could have done without anybody to stop her.\u0026rdquo;\nDevil nodded, and after a moment of silence she added. \u0026ldquo;Your turn.\u0026rdquo;\nThis brought Deziree back to their asking game. She had a lot of questions, but right now it was hard for her to figure out the right one. \u0026ldquo;Uhm, why did you approach me instead of\u0026hellip; y\u0026rsquo;know grab those containers or something like that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hm,\u0026rdquo; Devil took some time to prepare the right words. \u0026ldquo;In my experience it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more constructive to talk to one another instead of showing hostility. After all, you probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to answer my questions if I attacked you out of the blue. And these containers\u0026hellip;if they got damaged in the struggle the contents would rain upon the city. I can\u0026rsquo;t even imagine the damage that could cause.\u0026rdquo;\nThere was no arguing with that.\n\u0026ldquo;My turn,\u0026rdquo; Devil continued. \u0026ldquo;Since you had the choice to become super, why did you drink that milk? What exactly are your goals?\u0026rdquo;\nAs simple as it sounded, as embarrassing was the answer. Deziree blushed as she thought about her original reasons behind drinking this potion. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t done that for the ability to rip open a vault door with her bare hands or the ability to bend other\u0026rsquo;s minds to her will.\n\u0026ldquo;I … uhm kinda did it for the looks,\u0026rdquo; she almost whispered.\nDevil raised her eyebrow. Given that they were hovering high over the city, the wind would usually make it impossible for her to hear Deziree, but her super hearing made up for that.\n\u0026ldquo;I mean, well\u0026hellip;I looked rather plain before I took it and\u0026hellip; when I encountered these women today, not only the Angel, but the one who attacked me as well. They just make you want to be like them, in a way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, I know that feeling,\u0026rdquo; Devil nodded. \u0026ldquo;But now that you have these looks, what are you gonna do with them? Especially since you got yourself quite the supply of them.\u0026rdquo;\nShe gestured at the containers that Deziree was still holding. Normally she would have struggled to carry even one of them, but right now the two had felt so light to her that she had almost forgotten about them. Then again, their valuable contents had kept them in the back of her head.\nHer mind darted back and forth. Deziree hadn\u0026rsquo;t planned ahead that far. Getting a large enough supply had been the natural thing to do - and the chaos at the lab had made it easier for her to get that. But aside from that\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;You haven\u0026rsquo;t thought that far, have you?\u0026rdquo; Devil eventually spoke it out.\nDeziree let her head hang low in defeat. \u0026ldquo;It was a spontaneous decision.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t beat yourself up because of that. It was even worse for me,\u0026rdquo; the redhead cheered her up. \u0026ldquo;I was heartbroken and my best friend had entrusted some of the potion to me. When I got sick on top of that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist any longer.\u0026rdquo;\nRaising her head again, Deziree managed to fill in the blanks. She had heard about Devil\u0026rsquo;s encounter with Mr. Riley, but since that wasn\u0026rsquo;t as well known as the Angel, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t mention it right now. What\u0026rsquo;s more, she knew that this guy had an affair with Susan Harland of all people. The same woman who had intended to kill Deziree for no reason at all.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I guess we all make mistakes,\u0026rdquo; she commented. \u0026ldquo;What exactly are you planning to do with your abilities?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you asked me a week ago I would have said \u0026lsquo;become a superheroine, of course\u0026rsquo; but now this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem too smart. That spot is occupied by Angel, after all, and stepping into the spotlight would only make it harder for her. For now I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get my life back on track and since I always wanted to be a doctor, I thought maybe I, with all these outrageous powers, I might somehow develop actual healing powers. Of course\u0026hellip;that\u0026rsquo;s a work in progress.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That sounds quite ambitious,\u0026rdquo; Deziree concluded. \u0026ldquo;But an honorable goal nonetheless.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There are some personal reasons behind that, too. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to solve a tricky problem with these powers and actually\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she averted her eyes as she sheepishly finished the sentence. \u0026ldquo;I could really use some of the stuff from these containers for that.\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree gulped as she heard that. \u0026ldquo;W-what do you mean, I thought the Angel shared her supply with you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah she does, but it\u0026rsquo;s kinda important for it to be of a different source than the one she has. You know the stuff changed our genes, and two people who took the potion from the same source would be like siblings. This might work with good friends, but for the partner\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much incestuous. A potion from another source however would mean that the changes were slightly different - no incest there.\u0026rdquo;\nNo, thought Desiree, that actually made sense. \u0026ldquo;So that explains why the Angel took the remainder of the third container with her.\u0026rdquo;\nDevil looked at her, surprised, but nodded eventually. \u0026ldquo;Well, in that case she might be having the time of her life right now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Dammit!\u0026rdquo; Michelle screamed as her fist slammed into the boulder. The giant rock crumbled under the force, and with a loud boom shattered into thousands of tiny pieces that flew in every possible direction.\nThe young woman looked around. By now she had turned a large part of the mountain front into a number of small stones. Any mining company would be proud of that, but for her it was merely a way to vent her frustration. In her mind she replayed her last conversation with James, which hadn\u0026rsquo;t gone entirely as planned. Now that she had found an alternative power source for him, she had intended for him to take it only for him to decline out of fear for the consequences. Unfortunately she couldn\u0026rsquo;t take that away from him. There was at least one person who died because she had taken the potion - so it was hard to argue with that no matter how convinced she was that everything would be alright. Then there had been the part about her wanting to get knocked up by him. Michelle knew that from an instinctive part this made sense - and that may actually be a subconscious reason for her. But still, she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to admit to herself that her wishes and desires all boiled down to a wish to procreate.\nFocusing the super energy in her eyes, two beams of blue light shot out of them and cut another boulder from the mountain. The rock fell towards her only for another punch of hers to shatter it just like the one before. Michelle had always wondered what she should use her destructive powers for, and now she had the answer: Nothing helped her vent her own anger better than senseless destruction. In the last five minutes she had caused more destruction than in her entire life before that. Fortunately, nobody would mourn the mountain she disfigured. There was nobody in the vicinity anyway.\nEventually, however she got bored with that. As much a stress reliever it was, the whole thing didn\u0026rsquo;t bring her any closer to a solution. To find that, she would need to talk to someone and get a third opinion. Rising up from the mountain, she instantly accelerated to make her way back home. Compared to last night, Michelle\u0026rsquo;s flight speed had significantly improved. The whole exertion with the plane had worked wonders on that front. Using all her cells to fly now seemed so easy, as if it had become a part of her. From the mountain in Africa to her hometown in the US it took a mere ten minutes - and she wasn\u0026rsquo;t even going full speed yet. She probably could fly around the world in twenty minutes instead of the almost full hour she had needed yesterday.\nOnce she was back in familiar airspace, she quickly scanned Amanda\u0026rsquo;s apartment - only to see Amanda wasn\u0026rsquo;t there. Michelle let out a disappointed frown. Amanda was the only other person that knew about her powers. Who else could she talk to about such a matter?\nIt took Amanda a while to get used to the smell in the bar. This was the first time she had visited in her super form and her enhanced senses were picking up more different scents than she was comfortable with. Next to her, Desire had struggled with the same problems. The decision to move their conversation from the skyline to a more hospitable place had more or less forced the other woman to come up with a codename and this had been it. Amanda didn\u0026rsquo;t think that Desire described the other woman well, though. Compared to any normal woman, she surely was a living fantasy, but compared to other supers like herself she didn\u0026rsquo;t stick ut that much. Their physiques were so similar that it was a matter of personal taste after all. Still, she didn\u0026rsquo;t complain about the name, especially since Desire had actually agreed to share a whole container of the super potion with Amanda. That was much more than she needed, and she definitely appreciated the gesture.\nThe two superwomen had changed their outfits into something more fitting for the occasion, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t mean they didn\u0026rsquo;t draw any attention. On the contrary, given the stares they were receiving, Amanda doubted that her Devil costume would have drawn any more attention than she had now. Desire smiled and blushed at all these eyes that were aimed at her. Amanda had the feeling that Desire enjoyed this quite a lot. Maybe the name wasn\u0026rsquo;t that far off after all. They chose a hidden corner booth for themselves.\n\u0026ldquo;So what exactly are you doing at that research institute?\u0026rdquo; Amanda resumed their conversation.\n\u0026ldquo;Funny thing: I\u0026rsquo;m a botanist.\u0026rdquo; Desire continued, \u0026ldquo;I had that stuff right in front of my nose for the last few months and had no idea what it was capable of.\u0026rdquo;\nThat surprised Amanda less than expected. Michelle and her had already theorized that the plant was alien and it made sense that there was more than one seed inside the meteor. Of course it would have been found.\n\u0026ldquo;I can see that. Drinking some alien plant juice isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a valid form of examination.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh it would have been one hell of a surprise,\u0026rdquo; Desire chuckled. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;m glad that it happened in my own apartment, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stand the idea of being filmed when it happened.\u0026rdquo;\nShe blushed. Amanda could all to well understand why she did so. Even though the first transformation started as a rough ride, it did finish as a really pleasurable one.\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm, there\u0026rsquo;s one question I am particularly interested in\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Desire blushed even further. Amanda wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if the other woman suddenly started glowing bright red if she got any more embarrassed. Stranger things had happened.\n\u0026ldquo;Shoot it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; her voice became a whisper. \u0026ldquo;Is it actually possible for us to have s-sex with normal men?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda could barely prevent herself from laughing. \u0026ldquo;Of course it is,\u0026rdquo; she said before adding with a smile. \u0026ldquo;And it feels awesome!\u0026rdquo;\nDesire\u0026rsquo;s eyes grew wide as her lips curled to a smile. Amanda could even see that the other woman rose into the air - probably involuntarily.\n\u0026ldquo;Keep it together,\u0026rdquo; she whispered. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re in public, after all.\u0026rdquo;\nBlushing again, Desire sank back onto her seat. \u0026ldquo;Sorry, I\u0026rsquo;m new to that.\u0026rdquo; A quick glance revealed that her little trip to the air had gone unnoticed. \u0026ldquo;All clear it seems.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Back to your job. You said you examined the plant, did you find anything out of the ordinary besides this liquid?\u0026rdquo;\nDesire thought a bit. \u0026ldquo;Well, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call it out of the ordinary since it\u0026rsquo;s an alien life form. The similarity to local plant life is quite striking. Oh, and it\u0026rsquo;s quite tough. We tried to cut off a leaf for sampling, but no matter what we tried, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it. Until yesterday I had no idea how to explain it, but after seeing the Angel carrying the plane this morning, I immediately had a feeling that this could be connected.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda was about to comment, when a waitress arrived at the table. To her surprise she already brought two beers and put them on their table.\n\u0026ldquo;From the two young men at the bar,\u0026rdquo; she announced and pointed to towards them.\nThe two men in question were admittedly handsome and seemed to have the money to spare. Their cheeky grins basically claimed \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re the best you can get here\u0026rdquo; and Amanda didn\u0026rsquo;t stand this kind of arrogance. Desire however returned the smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Which one do you want?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;My fiancé,\u0026rdquo; Amanda answered right away. \u0026ldquo;Not one of these guys.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh? I thought you were heartbroken before you took the potion?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda bit her lip, this topic was quite close to unmasking her.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s just say it worked out somehow,\u0026rdquo; she commented, hoping to end the topic quickly.\n\u0026ldquo;Come to think of it, didn\u0026rsquo;t you deliver a guy to the hospital a few days ago? Had that anything to do with it?\u0026rdquo;\nNow Amanda was getting nervous. The other woman knew a lot more than she expected. \u0026ldquo;Uhm, well\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she stammered. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk about that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh come on,\u0026rdquo; the brunette urged. \u0026ldquo;If that was an accident, you could tell me how it happened. After all something similar could happen with me as well. You also all but know who I am anyway. All you have to do is ask your friend and she\u0026rsquo;ll be able to identify me.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda let out a sigh. Desire had a point. \u0026ldquo;Ok, I\u0026rsquo;ll admit it. He was my ex-boyfriend at the time. It\u0026rsquo;s complicated. He had cheated on me, so I dumped him. And I took the potion right after he had fetched his stuff from my place. I went for a flight through the city and found myself at his place as he was about to arrive. Given that I looked radically different I wanted to use that as I flirted with him a bit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I take it he was like wax in your hands?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually he wasn\u0026rsquo;t. On the contrary he was more affected by the breakup than I expected. Unfortunately I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that and kicked his car to bits and then took him for a quick flight - too bad his shirt couldn\u0026rsquo;t carry his weight.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ouch\u0026hellip; hard to believe that this still worked out in the end.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit complicated. There were circumstances behind his cheating, stuff that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t known before and that allowed me to make an exception for him.\u0026rdquo;\nDesire listened intently and nodded. \u0026ldquo;So you didn\u0026rsquo;t know about his condition? I mean a terminal sickness isn\u0026rsquo;t a small deal.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened. \u0026ldquo;H-how did you know that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;ve had the questionable honor of playing babysitter for the woman your ex had an affair with. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say every encounter got worse - until she tried to kill me today.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Amanda almost crushed her drink as she heard that. \u0026ldquo;That Harland bitch is super?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not anymore. She may still look like it, but her powers were gone when the Angel was done with her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t understand. She still looked super even when she was out of energy?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes. Is that strange? I thought people would turn back to normal once out of power, but after seeing that I imagined that I\u0026rsquo;d get to keep these,\u0026rdquo; Desire pointed at her chest.\nShaking her head Amanda tried to figure this out. \u0026ldquo;No, we usually transform back to normal. Well not really, we still look better than before but can still be recognized as our original selves. It would be the first time I heard about someone looking super even after being out of energy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Interesting,\u0026rdquo; Desire commented. \u0026ldquo;So despite our deep-rooted changes into half-alien hybrids, we still look perfectly human when we run out of energy? This sounds a bit like that is supposed to conserve said energy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed. And in the long run it should be possible for us to absorb sunlight to produce the super energy ourselves.\u0026rdquo;\nNow Desire seemed surprised. \u0026ldquo;That doesn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense strictly speaking. The amount of energy in the sunlight is far too low to allow any of the stuff we can do. Especially compared to the amount of liquid the plant can produce.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You may have a point there, but I can definitely feel how the sunlight gets absorbed and turned into super energy - even though it\u0026rsquo;s not much. If anything it is a catalyst the plants and our bodies need to produce super energy. Right now we\u0026rsquo;re rather bad at it which explains why we deplete our supply. At one point however, we\u0026rsquo;ll be producing more than we use up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh god that\u0026rsquo;s it!\u0026rdquo; Desire exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;I know why Susan didn\u0026rsquo;t transform back to normal! She had drunk so much of the potion at once that she reached the maximum she could store. That\u0026rsquo;s why she lactated the excess energy as an own potion. For her body this must\u0026rsquo;ve been a sign that she didn\u0026rsquo;t need the \u0026lsquo;low power\u0026rsquo; state anymore.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So all it needs is drinking enough potion and we\u0026rsquo;d be stuck like this?\u0026rdquo; Amanda whispered. Part of her liked the double identity she could have as her normal self and Devil. As good as it felt to be Devil, she had a normal life that she could live. How would that affect her life with Fred if that happened? Her eyes widened. She had spent hours looking through her medical books to figure out a way to cure his Harland Syndrome and how the potion had proven fatal for Erika. Could this be the solution?\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t look like that\u0026rsquo;s a bad thing\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Desire commented.\n\u0026ldquo;Well I just had an idea. But I would need some information first. You see the potion proved deadly for someone with Harland Syndrome, and I need to verify the cause of death. If it\u0026rsquo;s the transformation back to normal, then the whole not transforming back part could be the solution to curing the Harland Syndrome.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Haha that would be it,\u0026rdquo; Desire chuckled. \u0026ldquo;For Susan Harland to find the cure her father searched his whole life, it sounds a bit ironic. But for the cause of death I suggest you ask the one doing the autopsy.\u0026rdquo; And with a nod towards the door she added. \u0026ldquo;And it seems like you\u0026rsquo;re lucky.\u0026rdquo;\nJacob suppressed a yawn as they entered the bar. He had spent the last nights in bars hoping to find any clue on the superwomen that had appeared. Monday night he might have encountered a male version of these, but he had faced into the wrong direction. Last night on his way home he had been lucky to encounter the Angel. That was about it in terms of success and given today\u0026rsquo;s events he had looked forward to an evening of peace and quiet.\nApparently James had thought otherwise. That in itself was a new development. Outside of work the two had never hung out and from the tone of him when he called, James had something on his mind that he wanted to drown in alcohol.\n\u0026ldquo;Two beers,\u0026rdquo; James ordered the first round.\n\u0026ldquo;So\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Jacob said after a while of awkward silence. \u0026ldquo;What made you decide to go for a drink tonight?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t it obvious? A woman!\u0026rdquo; James said grudgingly.\n\u0026ldquo;That would be \u0026lsquo;who\u0026rsquo; made you decide to go for a drink. I was asking for the actual story.\u0026rdquo; Jacob countered.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s just say my girlfriend moves pretty fast in certain things.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did she ask you to move in already?\u0026rdquo; Jacobe asked half-seriously.\nJames shook his head. \u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit more complicated than that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I assume that it has something to do with a certain blonde goddess who likes bullet-massages and uses planes for a workout.\u0026rdquo;\nNow James seemed shocked. \u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, you told me she\u0026rsquo;s a reporter, so I thought she might have expected you to give out some classified information to her.\u0026rdquo;\nJames shook his head. \u0026ldquo;No, she\u0026rsquo;s not like that.\u0026rdquo;\nNow this was a surprise.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you telling me that you\u0026rsquo;re dating a reporter that doesn\u0026rsquo;t want you to talk about the news of the day, not to mention the week, month and most likely year?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not what I meant. I mean that she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use that information for her career.\u0026rdquo;\nThis sounded fishy to Jacob. \u0026ldquo;Sounds like you\u0026rsquo;re readily trusting here.\u0026rdquo;\nJames burst into laughter. \u0026ldquo;To you it may seem that way, but trust me: Compared to her I am very skeptical.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip;I have to take your word on that. After all, I\u0026rsquo;ve never met her.\u0026rdquo; He took a sip from his beer. \u0026ldquo;So what did she rush about?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a private matter, sorry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Freaky ideas for the bedroom, huh? Or did she stop using protection?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Something along those lines, so let\u0026rsquo;s switch the topic.\u0026rdquo; James said sourly as he took a sip from his beer.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, new topic then. What do you think it would be like to bang the Angel?\u0026rdquo;\nJames almost spat out his beer. \u0026ldquo;What the hell?\u0026rdquo; He said in between coughs. \u0026ldquo;Why did you come up with that topic?\u0026rdquo;\nJacob laughed at this reaction. \u0026ldquo;Right now, the look on your face would be reason enough. And besides work we didn\u0026rsquo;t have many topics.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe. But after today, does it really have to be this one?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey! At least you got through all that without a scratch. And you were the only one to do so. God I was tempted to return the favor to that bitch.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So you questioned her?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t very informative, though. Didn\u0026rsquo;t know how she ended up that way. From her point of view these powers were an STD.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We have hints that claim otherwise,\u0026rdquo; James countered dryly.\n\u0026ldquo;True. Actually, I think that strange liquid was somehow slipped to her. From Ms. Harland\u0026rsquo;s description it looks like her partner was super too. Given what we know, he would have to make her super in order to sleep with her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uh-huh.\u0026rdquo; James didn\u0026rsquo;t sound too interested. \u0026ldquo;Well maybe it was less a necessity but more of a personal preference. Assuming he\u0026rsquo;s behind the drug addict and Ms. Riley, neither of them were in perfect health after all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The Asian too, she was in a wheelchair after all.\u0026rdquo; Jacob added. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sensing a pattern here. Some guy picking out women with health problems, giving them the potion which causes them to become both healthy and attractive. Then he sleeps with them and leaves them on their own. In some cases they could roam the city - like the redhead, the Asian and Ms. Harland - while in other cases the health problems came back with a vengeance.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t like that.\u0026rdquo; James took another sip. \u0026ldquo;Giving them power, changing their genes and then leaving them unguided. Seems like he doesn\u0026rsquo;t care for the consequences at all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He probably thought he was doing them a favor. After all, he outright encouraged Ms. Harland to have fun with her powers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If destroying a lab and trying to kill people for the hell of it was his definition of fun, then we have an even bigger problem than him creating mutants left and right.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, for today at least we\u0026rsquo;ve seen enough of them,\u0026rdquo; Jacob tried to end the topic.\nJames turned to him, but then his gaze went past him and into a corner of the bar. Letting out another sigh, he focused back on his beer. \u0026ldquo;Corner booth at eight o\u0026rsquo;clock, two women,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Was that fight of yours really bad enough to be looking at other women already?\u0026rdquo; Jacob asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Just look!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd Jacob did as he was told. What he saw made his heart drop. With her backside faced towards him, there was a redhead. So far so unimpressive. But the other woman was an outright hot brunette whose green eyes showed a glow he had seen before. There was no doubt that this beauty was just as super as the Angel or Ms. Harland had been. And her eyes were fixed on his to boot. Before he could even wonder if the redhead was super as well, she turned around to reveal glowing orange orbs that instantly locked onto him as well. Her lips curled into a smile as she waved them over.\n\u0026ldquo;Looks like they noticed us too,\u0026rdquo; he commented.\n\u0026ldquo;Hello?\u0026rdquo; the familiar voice came through the phone.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi JJ, it\u0026rsquo;s me,\u0026rdquo; Michelle said like she always did.\n\u0026ldquo;M-Michelle?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Who else?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; JJ paused. \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s your number on the display, but your voice sounds so different that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recognize it.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle bit her lip. She was still in her super form and had totally forgotten that her voice was different compared to her normal form. Not wanting to explain the changes she had gone through was the reason she was calling JJ instead of flying the five hundred miles to drop by.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh that, I have some trouble with my phone so my voice comes over a bit weird,\u0026rdquo; she lied. \u0026ldquo;But I can hear you just fine and so far nobody complained about the way I sound over the phone sometimes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say it sounds bad either, but it\u0026rsquo;s strange not to hear my sister\u0026rsquo;s familiar voice. Maybe you should get a new phone?\u0026rdquo; JJ suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll consider it, but that\u0026rsquo;s not why I called. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a fight with my boyfriend and I\u0026rsquo;d like to hear your opinion on it.\u0026rdquo;\nA few seconds of silence followed.\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know you were seeing someone,\u0026rdquo; JJ commented. \u0026ldquo;But go ahead.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, this may be a bit hard to follow, but I found something that would do wonders for his health, but he refuses to do it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is he sick or something?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, he\u0026rsquo;s actually in good health.\u0026rdquo;\nAnother moment of silence before JJ answered. \u0026ldquo;If he\u0026rsquo;s in good health, how do you plan to improve it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As I said it\u0026rsquo;s complicated. But I would really want him to go through with it, how can I convince him?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sis, I have no idea what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about here. All I can say is if it ain\u0026rsquo;t broke, don\u0026rsquo;t try to fix it. He probably has his reasons why he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But those reasons are far-fetched, if not plain wrong. It worked for me just great. And if he did it, it would take our relationship to a whole new level.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How long have you known each other again?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle bit her lip. \u0026ldquo;Sunday,\u0026rdquo; she admitted. \u0026ldquo;But it feels like I\u0026rsquo;ve known him for my entire life. I know it\u0026rsquo;s hard to understand, but that\u0026rsquo;s how it is.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t claim to know the guy, but from what I\u0026rsquo;ve heard you should stop forcing the issue. You\u0026rsquo;ve been dating for half a week, so whatever it is you want from him, it\u0026rsquo;s too soon. Right now you\u0026rsquo;re rushing things. Give it more time, maybe he\u0026rsquo;ll warm up to the idea later. It has to be his own choice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But\u0026hellip; I didn\u0026rsquo;t get to choose either!\u0026rdquo; Michelle blurted out before she knew what she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Sis\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; JJ\u0026rsquo;s voice was calm and serious, something Michelle rarely heard. \u0026ldquo;What are we talking about here? I\u0026rsquo;d like to help you but you have to tell me what\u0026rsquo;s going on.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026hellip; wouldn\u0026rsquo;t believe me even if I told you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Have you been paying attention to the news today? Ah who am I kidding, of course you have. After seeing news about a superheroine there\u0026rsquo;s nothing that could be too far-fetched anymore. And you know you can trust me with anything.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle pondered her options. It was obvious that JJ wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to give helpful advice with this level of information. On the other hand Michelle wasn\u0026rsquo;t prepared to tell her family about her condition. Then again she had practically told James after little more than a day.\n\u0026ldquo;You know what, you\u0026rsquo;re right. But this is more face-to-face news.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re over five hundred miles apart. Unless you plan to stop by in the near future, I think it can be excused to tell me over the phone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then I\u0026rsquo;ll just have to come over.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tonight? It\u0026rsquo;s the middle of the week, you know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fast!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not that fast,\u0026rdquo; JJ countered weakly.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll see about that,\u0026rdquo; Michelle said right before she hung up. Continuing this argument would only spoil the moment of surprise. \u0026ldquo;Five hundred miles,\u0026rdquo; she said aloud as she hovered over to the balcony door. \u0026ldquo;Won\u0026rsquo;t even take me five minutes!\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree was beside herself. The encounter with Devil had started of quite scary, but by now, the situation had turned out quite well. Both superwomen had used their super hearing to eavesdrop on Dr. Thompson and Det. Spencer and the conversation had been interesting to say the least. Now that the men had noticed them, they were on their way towards them. She was almost bursting with anticipation. Her whole life she had been the unimpressive one, the girl nobody noticed. And now? Now there was a bar full of guys that would die to talk to her. And these two were the only ones who had done so before. Granted, Dr. Thompson had rejected her advances earlier, but he hadn\u0026rsquo;t lied about his girlfriend at least. Deziree wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure whether or not to be happy about his trouble with her, though.\nHer focus, however, was on Jacob. Not only had they survived the encounter with Susan together, but he had also asked her out on a date. Using her X-ray vision to check out the wounds he had suffered today, she soon caught herself using it for less medical purposes. With her sight returning to normal, she composed herself right on time before Jacob spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;Good evening ladies, mind if we join you?\u0026rdquo; he asked with a hint of nervousness. Unlike all other men in the bar, these two knew full well what they were dealing with here. Given what had happened with Susan this almost counted as brave.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure, we could always use some company,\u0026rdquo; Devil flirtingly answered.\nThe two men sat down, Jacob next to Devil and James next to Deziree. Why couldn\u0026rsquo;t it be the other way around? She wondered.\n\u0026ldquo;This is Dr. James Thompson, and my name is Jacob Spencer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re a bit picky about telling our names. You can call me Devil, and her …\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;D-Desire,\u0026rdquo; Deziree stammered. Both men looked at each other and shrugged.\n\u0026ldquo;So what were you girls talking about?\u0026rdquo; Jacob continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh you know, the usual stuff. Diet, fitness and fashion.\u0026rdquo;\nJames chuckled in a mocking manner.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly a fashion freak,\u0026rdquo; Jacob answered. \u0026ldquo;But I\u0026rsquo;d like to hear about the other two, right James?\u0026rdquo;\nJames only nodded about that. \u0026ldquo;Yeah, especially the diet sounds interesting.\u0026rdquo; The sarcasm was hard to miss.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s just say it\u0026rsquo;s all only natural products.\u0026rdquo; Devil teased.\nDeziree immediately notices a hint of fear on Jacobs face. Even though Devil had remained calm and was playful and friendly, the cop couldn\u0026rsquo;t totally shake the fact that his last encounter with a superwoman had been less than pleasant.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, we won\u0026rsquo;t bite,\u0026rdquo; she assured him.\nJacob looked at her quizzically. Apparently he had assumed that his nervousness would remain hidden behind the poker face he had set up.\n\u0026ldquo;And where would you get these natural products?\u0026rdquo; he asked with feigned innocence.\nDeziree didn\u0026rsquo;t like that he was only addressing Devil here. Granted she was a lot more knowledgeable than she was, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t know that, did he?\n\u0026ldquo;You just have to know the right sources,\u0026rdquo; Devil teased further.\nJacob sighted. \u0026ldquo;How about we stop fooling aroung? Ok, how did you get the stuff that turned you into what you are now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It was a present from a friend,\u0026rdquo; Devil answered, her smile not even disappearing for a second. \u0026ldquo;And I think you have heard about her.\u0026rdquo;\nJacob nodded. \u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;d like to talk to you about Fred Riley.\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree began to feel uncomfortable. From the corner of her eye she saw that James eyed her skeptically while Jacob was utterly fixated on Devil. What really bothered her was the growing amount of nervousness he tried to hide - not to mention the tricky topic he was bringing up.\n\u0026ldquo;What about him?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Your encounter with him wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly good for his health, so I wondered why you met him in the first place. Shortly before your friend saved his sisters life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As suspicious as it may sound, it was just a coincidence. After all, Ms. Riley was a hostage in a bank robbery, so it should be clear why my friend interfered there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That may be true, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain why you approached Mr. Riley.\u0026rdquo; Jacob dug further. \u0026ldquo;After all, he didn\u0026rsquo;t press charges after landing at the hospital.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If he didn\u0026rsquo;t press charges, then I wonder why it is your business what I do in my free time and why I do it.\u0026rdquo;\nJacob sighed, and Deziree understood why. Had Devil denied any connection, then he might have had a chance to notice a lie on her part. And if not, it would\u0026rsquo;ve told him that he was heading in the wrong direction. In other words he really hadn\u0026rsquo;t learned anything from that.\nStill, his behavior was strange. Jacob was nervous, Deziree could tell that and probably so could Devil. But if he was so nervous, why was he asking such touchy questions? There was something else on his mind.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll get to that,\u0026rdquo; Jacob answered. \u0026ldquo;First I want to know about your connection to Susan Harland.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Susan who?\u0026rdquo; Devil lied.\nHad Deziree not already known that Devil was lying here, she would have been fooled as well.\n\u0026ldquo;The woman Mr. Riley had an affair with shortly before you assaulted him!\u0026rdquo; Jacob calmly continued.\nNow even James\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened. Devil and Deziree had followed their conversation earlier with their super hearing, and Jacob hadn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned this important detail there. But instead of widening, Devil\u0026rsquo;s eyes narrowed.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you implying?\u0026rdquo; she asked dangerously.\n\u0026ldquo;A two-timing man gets attacked a day after his affair is found out. Which means at least two women had a motive to get back at him.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I take offense in calling it an attack when even the victim doesn\u0026rsquo;t call it as such,\u0026rdquo; Devil countered.\nNow Deziree was getting nervous too. It was obvious that Jacob was on the right track, yet the way he did it only pissed her off. Why didn\u0026rsquo;t he even try to be more polite?\n\u0026ldquo;I think we should calm down a bit,\u0026rdquo; she said hoping that this would lighten up the mood.\nNext to her James nodded in agreement. He didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be in the best mood - not a surprise given the earlier conversation - but at least he was aware that Jacob\u0026rsquo;s course of action was dangerous.\nJacob looked back at them, and when their eyes met, Deziree could see his expression becoming friendlier. She smiled at the effect she had on him. Apparently she had defused the situation.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry, I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean to insult you. I just had a rough day.\u0026rdquo; Jacob subconsciously touched his arm - where Deziree knew he was bandaged. She didn\u0026rsquo;t need to apply her X-ray vision to see that either, as she had been the one to apply the bandages.\n\u0026ldquo;So, Desire,\u0026rdquo; now James picked up the conversation. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s your story?\u0026rdquo;\nNow this was a topic she didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to discuss with him. After all, it would be easy for them to track her story back to her.\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; uhm, there isn\u0026rsquo;t much to tell yet. Drank some stuff, ended up like this and that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much it already. But I think I turned out fine, don\u0026rsquo;t you agree?\u0026rdquo; She proudly stuck out her chest to prove her point. The men didn\u0026rsquo;t know it was her, but it was hard for a mortal woman to compare to what she was now anyway.\nThe reactions varied on that. Devil cuckled knowingly, James nodded in approval and Jacob\u0026hellip; well he outright stared at her chest. Deziree couldn\u0026rsquo;t avoid a chuckle herself.\n\u0026ldquo;So\u0026hellip; this is really part of the whole package?\u0026rdquo; Jacob asked. \u0026ldquo;Just to clarify, I mean.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a reason it\u0026rsquo;s called the most common superpower after all,\u0026rdquo; Devil laughingly added.\n\u0026ldquo;I wonder if there\u0026rsquo;s any scientific explanation for that,\u0026rdquo; Jacob thought out loud. \u0026ldquo;I mean it\u0026rsquo;s a bit strange that having super powers includes physical attractiveness.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually,\u0026rdquo; Devil began to explain. \u0026ldquo;The increased muscularity is an obvious side-effect of the vastly increased strength, fortunately we don\u0026rsquo;t look the part there. Our bodies are powered by some strange energy that makes fat cells obsolete - and we store most of this energy in our breasts - hence their size.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Strange energy? Stored inside your breasts? That\u0026hellip; doesn\u0026rsquo;t really make sense.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Neither does being able to fly, yet here we are,\u0026rdquo; Deziree interrupted. \u0026ldquo;I know it\u0026rsquo;s hard to understand, but we can see this energy and feel it inside our bodies. And it\u0026rsquo;s more effective than fat cells alone would be.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But why the breasts? Not that I\u0026rsquo;m complaining but even I know that this isn\u0026rsquo;t the first place for women to store extra energy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have remember that the powers come from a plant - which obviously stored the excess energy in the form of this superpower granting liquid. The milk glands are pretty much the human equivalent to that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sounds plausible\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Jacob turned towards James. \u0026ldquo;Or is that just me?\u0026rdquo;\nJames shook his head. \u0026ldquo;No, sounds pretty logical to me too. How that energy works, however will have to be further examined before we understand that.\u0026rdquo;\nNodding, Jacob turned his attention back to Deziree, his curiosity getting the better of him. \u0026ldquo;What does it feel like?\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree smiled at the attention. \u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to describe. It\u0026rsquo;s like a constant warmth, comforting yet at the same time it feels so … fresh and alive.\u0026rdquo;\nJacob stared at her with an open mouth. \u0026ldquo;How about flying? Is it hard?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh I can\u0026rsquo;t even begin to describe that. It just feels great to soar through the air, to be able to go where I want. The ultimate feeling of freedom so to speak. And no it\u0026rsquo;s not hard, it\u0026rsquo;s just natural.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ahem,\u0026rdquo; Devil cleared her throat. \u0026ldquo;And as you can see it\u0026rsquo;s harder to keep her feet on the ground than to fly.\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree noticed what the other superwoman had meant as she descended back onto her seat. Somewhere during her description she had begun to hover out of it and almost exposed her powers.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; she added, blushing. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s all just very new to me.\u0026rdquo; She explained to Jacob.\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed it is,\u0026rdquo; Devil continued, looking at Jacob first and then addressing Deziree. \u0026ldquo;You haven\u0026rsquo;t tested out the whole power-sharing part yet, right?\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree looked at her quizzically. \u0026ldquo;Uhm, no I haven\u0026rsquo;t. But didn\u0026rsquo;t you say it was rather easy to do?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I sure did,\u0026rdquo; Devil confirmed with a smile. \u0026ldquo;But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to practice a bit. Trust me, I speak out of experience here. How about you go out and show Jacob here how it works?\u0026rdquo;\nNow Deziree understood her actual intent. James was Devil\u0026rsquo;s best shot at getting the information she needed, so she probably wanted Jacob out of the picture for that. Why exactly Jacob was in the way here, Deziree didn\u0026rsquo;t know - it was probably his curiosity. Not that she would complain here anyway.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you think?\u0026rdquo; she asked Jacob, who seemed a bit stunned by the idea.\n\u0026ldquo;Power sharing?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;In short, we can temporary share part of our powers through skin contact. It\u0026rsquo;s not as effective as actually being super, but it\u0026rsquo;s really convenient when you don\u0026rsquo;t want someone to get hurt,\u0026rdquo; Devil explained.\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm,\u0026rdquo; Jacob looked at James, probably wondering why he had been chosen here.\n\u0026ldquo;Go ahead,\u0026rdquo; the scientist nodded. \u0026ldquo;I think I\u0026rsquo;ll go with the more scientific questions while you\u0026rsquo;re gone.\u0026rdquo;\nThat caused Jacob to laugh. \u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s your field of expertise after all.\u0026rdquo; And to Deziree he added, \u0026ldquo;So we\u0026rsquo;re going?\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree nodded with a smile and they both made their way to the exit.\nJJ was still confused about the conversation with Michelle when a sudden noise broke this train of thought. It was the sound of something knocking against the window. And twice at that. Wondering who would go through the trouble of raising attention this way instead of the doorbell, JJ marched towards it and pushed the curtains aside\u0026hellip; and almost fainted on the spot.\nOutside the window was a stunning blonde woman with bright blue eyes. She wore nothing more than a black leotard, sitting cross-legged on thin air. JJ blinked twice to check that there really was no ladder or rope to support this beauty - she was really flying under her own power.\nJJ gulped as she draw the logical conclusion. This was the woman that had been all over the news today. The worlds first superhero, the Angel. And for some weird reason, she was right outside the window and gesturing for JJ to open it. Sure enough, JJ complied.\n\u0026ldquo;Three minutes and twenty-four seconds from my place to yours. Fast enough?\u0026rdquo; the goddess asked with a playful grin.\n\u0026ldquo;Finally alone,\u0026rdquo; Amanda said once the other two had left the bar. \u0026ldquo;You can imagine that I have a few questions I didn\u0026rsquo;t want them to hear.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I suspected as much,\u0026rdquo; James answered as he took a sip of his beer. \u0026ldquo;That goes both ways, actually.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah. We kinda eavesdropped on your conversation earlier. Wanna talk about it first?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, you can start if you want.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alright,\u0026rdquo; Amanda took a long breath. \u0026ldquo;You know who I am, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So … how\u0026rsquo;s the autopsy going?\u0026rdquo; She cut right to the chase.\n\u0026ldquo;Slowly. The cause of death was a heart attack - probably caused by her transforming back to normal.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Any details on that? Can you say whether it was her decreasing invulnerability or the simple fact that her heart returned to its usual shape, like the rest of her body?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t say for sure. It\u0026rsquo;s probably the latter combined with the decreased immune system shortly after the first transformation that could have done it. As I said, the autopsy progresses slowly and I had a few distractions today.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, I heard about the thing with the Harland bitch. Is it true that she didn\u0026rsquo;t fully transform back to normal?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed. Although I have no idea why.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hm\u0026hellip;Desire had an idea about that. It was probably some kind of overdose on the potion - which also caused Ms. Harland to lactate the excess energy as superpower-granting milk.\u0026rdquo;\nJames' eyes widened. \u0026ldquo;What? Super milk? I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen any of that lying around. And how does Des\u0026hellip; oh I get it: Deziree. She must\u0026rsquo;ve snuck it out before anybody noticed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She didn\u0026rsquo;t give her actual name - but she said she was one of your colleagues that got attacked today.\u0026rdquo;\nJames sighed. \u0026ldquo;Just great. She really didn\u0026rsquo;t put much thought into that. How does she intend to hide that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have no idea,\u0026rdquo; Amanda answered. \u0026ldquo;But let\u0026rsquo;s get back to topic: I\u0026rsquo;ve got a theory and I\u0026rsquo;d like to hear your opinion about it\u0026rsquo;s feasibility.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This should be far enough,\u0026rdquo; Deziree announced as they reached the park.\nShe and Jacob had walked all the way here in order not to be spotted during their little test flight. On the way they had engaged in small talk with her asking about his work and his life in general - while avoiding giving him any hint about her true identity. That aspect was getting harder and harder as they talked. Not that it was a big challenge for her to circumvent any tricky topic, she quickly lost much motivation to do so. After all, Jacob had played a big role in saving her life earlier and it felt bad to lie to him when he so openly told about himself. And it didn\u0026rsquo;t help that she was having a good time now.\nJacob looked around. \u0026ldquo;Yep, seems like we\u0026rsquo;re alone. So\u0026hellip; uhm how does this work again?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In short, I can share certain powers through skin contact.\u0026rdquo; Deziree reached out her hand. \u0026ldquo;Ready?\u0026rdquo;\nJacob looked at her a bit surprised, obviously doubting that holding hands would make him fly with her. Still he grasped her hand.\nDeziree immediately felt what Devil had explained to her in theory. It felt rather easy to push some of her super energy into his body, and she tried it out right away. But instead of making him weightless, she first took care of his wounds by making him invulnerable. Devil had mentioned that this would also relieve his pain.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, that feels nice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad you like it, now let\u0026rsquo;s become airborne shall we?\u0026rdquo;\nJacob looked into her eyes and nodded.\nNot wasting any more time, Deziree put her plans in motion. A second later, the both began hovering off the ground, slowly rising into the air.\n\u0026ldquo;How does it feel?\u0026rdquo; she asked. \u0026ldquo;Should be even better, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; kinda dizzy actually.\u0026rdquo;\nNow that wasn\u0026rsquo;t what she had expected to hear. To her it was one of the most pleasureable feelings she had experienced so far. This was probably because her senses were more acute and most importantly adapted to the powers she possessed.\n\u0026ldquo;Too bad. You\u0026rsquo;re really missing something here. Do you want me to stop?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; he answered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like to see the world from your view once.\u0026rdquo;\nThis caused Deziree to fasten their ascend even before she consciously decided to do so. \u0026ldquo;Alright, hold tight!\u0026rdquo;\nJacob didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be asked twice.\nIt took Michelle about half an hour to explain her situation to JJ. Unsurprisingly her sibling showed a great interest in the abilities Michelle had acquired, what she had done with them so far and - of course - her new look.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s still hard to believe that my older sister is now some kind of supergirl.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Trust me, even I find it hard to believe at times. And this sudden spike in popularity doesn\u0026rsquo;t help either. It\u0026rsquo;s just weird when people talk about me while I am present in my normal form.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So … you can switch back and forth?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I tried. Mostly I turn back when I run out of steam, but I can force myself back to normal too under certain conditions - for now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Could you -you know- show me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Unfortunately not,\u0026rdquo; Michelle answered. \u0026ldquo;I have too much energy inside me to do that right now.\u0026rdquo;\nShe let her head drop as she considered this part. There was also the issue of reaching 100% of her capacity.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the matter?\u0026rdquo; JJ asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s just that at some point I will be stuck like this\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Michelle hesitantly said. \u0026ldquo;I mean, right now I just have too much energy inside me to will myself back to normal, but if I reach a certain point I will never transform back, even when I\u0026rsquo;m out of energy\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And that would be bad because\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right now I can live a normal life by day and transform when danger calls. A double life, so to speak. But that would be over once I\u0026rsquo;m stuck as this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And?\u0026rdquo; JJ dug further.\n\u0026ldquo;And what? Isn\u0026rsquo;t losing that enough already? I mean, I can\u0026rsquo;t even begin to imagine how Mum and Dad would react upon learning about this. Then there\u0026rsquo;s all my coworkers\u0026hellip;in short everybody I know would be affected. Nothing would be the same again!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hm, interesting.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that all you can say about that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I was just surprised that you didn\u0026rsquo;t mention your boyfriend. Given that you barely know him\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He knows about this,\u0026rdquo; Michelle explained. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s a scientist and somehow tracked me down after my first night out as this. Long story short we went out, got together and I told him.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So what\u0026rsquo;s the problem with him? Doesn\u0026rsquo;t he like this hot version of you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think this is too risky!\u0026rdquo; James said after Amanda had told him about her plan. \u0026ldquo;There are too many unknowns that could cause complications. And given Ms. Riley\u0026rsquo;s example, complications mean death!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Doing nothing would mean the same,\u0026rdquo; Amanda countered. \u0026ldquo;The Harland\u0026rsquo;s Syndrome was the reason she died upon transforming back. If she hadn\u0026rsquo;t transformed back she would still be alive and kicking! All we have to do is prevent that and everything will be fine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It would require permanent use of that potion.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not exactly. Eventually he would be able to absorb sunlight on his own and become independent of the potion. Not to mention the aspect of not transforming at all after an overdose.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know that for sure.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We could test it out first. All that\u0026rsquo;s needed is an overdose and if I don\u0026rsquo;t turn back afterwards, we have our answer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; since it\u0026rsquo;s your body I can\u0026rsquo;t stop you from testing it out. But you are aware that you\u0026rsquo;d be stuck like that.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda rolled her eyes. \u0026ldquo;So what? If all goes to plan, so would he. Sounds only fair to end up the same way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t go according to plan: he dies. Are you willing to take that risk?\u0026rdquo; James sighed. \u0026ldquo;Why do I get the feeling that you just want to have a super partner?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s just a fortunate side-effect,\u0026rdquo; Amanda countered with a slight grin before her expression became more serious. \u0026ldquo;But it seems you see this differently. Did this strike a nerve?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You could say that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is it about the \u0026lsquo;rushing things\u0026rsquo; you mentioned earlier? I know Michelle took some of the potion after kicking that Harland girl\u0026rsquo;s ass.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, she really wants me to take that stuff as well.\u0026rdquo; James took another sip of his beer, emptying it. \u0026ldquo;Just to spice things up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just to spice things up? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s her instincts. She may claim to spice things up or something like that, but her instincts tell her that as we are now we can\u0026rsquo;t procreate, so she searches for a solution there. Having me drink the potion is that solution. And she doesn\u0026rsquo;t like any reasoning against it because of that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Have you actually discussed the pros and cons of you taking the potion?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mainly the cons, actually. She may have managed to live her normal life so far, but I am working at a facility that specifically looks for strange things, and her stunt with the plane has made the existence of supers public. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I could hide it long-term. Especially if your theory about the super form becoming permanent over time is to be believed. But she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to hear that. She has this inner voice that tells her everything is going to work out and gets mad when I don\u0026rsquo;t buy it as easily.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, you may have your reasons for declining, but did you hear her out? She\u0026rsquo;s bound to have more reasons for wanting this than a hunch.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; James looked at his empty beer. \u0026ldquo;She kinda left before we could finish the discussion.\u0026rdquo;\nNow that he thought about it, Michelle seemed more hurt by the fact that he was against it than the arguments he used for that.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh I can imagine how that one went: She brought it up without actually considering that you might be against it and thus was utterly lost in an argument.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah that sounds about right.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda sighed. \u0026ldquo;And here I thought you had this super telepathic connection to each other that made understanding so much easier.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seems like that one backfired. She clearly felt that I was against it and left before she got too pissed-off. I think she needs to cool herself down a bit and she\u0026rsquo;ll be fine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let me ask you one thing: Are you against taking the potion in general? Or can you imagine that you\u0026rsquo;d take the potion eventually?\u0026rdquo;\nJames took a few seconds to think about that.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not that I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine doing that. But right now it would feel rushed. I mean, let\u0026rsquo;s be honest. I\u0026rsquo;ve known her for half a week now. We\u0026rsquo;re freshly in love and thus not in the position to make life-changing decisions. Taking the potion is a one-way road. It\u0026rsquo;s a kind of commitment that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be rushed like that. I mean, even marriage is reversible\u0026hellip;but this isn\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So you\u0026rsquo;re basically mad at him because he didn\u0026rsquo;t want to take the same stuff that turned you into this?\u0026rdquo; JJ concluded.\n\u0026ldquo;Pretty much,\u0026rdquo; Michelle confirmed, already expecting what JJ was about to say next.\n\u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t you say that you weren\u0026rsquo;t totally ok with the long-term effects of this stuff? Like being stuck like this? Sounds a bit hypocritical to me, for you to want him in the same dilemma as yourself. Why would you want that anyway?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s … complicated. For one thing, ever since I first transformed like this I wondered what it would be like to be with a man on the same level. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s already way better than normal this way but I still have to hold back somewhat and protect him from my own strength.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm\u0026hellip; I can somewhat understand this argument, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really think it would be worth the downsides.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, he already mentioned that this might be my instincts way of telling me to procreate, and I can\u0026rsquo;t really claim that he\u0026rsquo;s wrong there. Anyway I do have other reasons, too. He\u0026rsquo;s working at a facility that researches the meteor aftermath - which includes supers as a whole.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wait\u0026hellip;there are more than you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes there are. I only shared some with Amanda so far, but there seems to be someone else passing the stuff around as well. And here\u0026rsquo;s the problem: Just today, James was in the middle of another woman\u0026rsquo;s rampage. That woman was out and about to go on a killing spree for no apparent reason, and he would have been killed if not for my interference.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And here I thought scientists had a safe job.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So did I, but this woman proved otherwise. And when I think about it further, this won\u0026rsquo;t change in the long run. I mean, if there are more supers out there and he\u0026rsquo;s the one tracking them down, it\u0026rsquo;s much more likely for them to react with hostility. If he were super himself, then he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to fear stuff like that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t this be counterproductive for him as well? I mean, if his bosses research supers, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t they start with him first? Given how different you look I doubt he would be able to hide it.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle bit her lip. \u0026ldquo;Probably not,\u0026rdquo; she admitted. \u0026ldquo;Even the unpowered form is slightly improved and someone would find it suspicious. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s … he is … I just don\u0026rsquo;t want him to get hurt, ok?\u0026rdquo;\nJJ laughed at that. \u0026ldquo;I can understand that. But this won\u0026rsquo;t be much of an argument if you start talking about how it would help him at his job. You care about his well-being and that\u0026rsquo;s good. Still, you have only known him for a few days so far. You\u0026rsquo;ll have to give it more time instead of rushing it.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle frowned. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s different from my perspective. We\u0026rsquo;ve got this bond\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s hard to put into words, but it somehow allows me to know him better than I could\u0026rsquo;ve dreamed of. It\u0026rsquo;s like I glimpsed into his naked soul\u0026hellip;and at times I can literally see the world through his eyes. This is how I was there in time to save him today, by the way. In short it feels like I\u0026rsquo;ve known him for years.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now that sounds romantic. But does he feel the same way?\u0026rdquo; JJ asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh he loves me, I can feel that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No\u0026hellip;What I mean is, does this bond goes both ways? Does he know you just as good as you know him?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, the bond does go both ways, yes\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle thought about it. JJ had raised a good point. Back on Saturday, when Michelle had brought Amanda out for some training, she had found out that her power sharing wasn\u0026rsquo;t as efficient as her own powers. Back then she had empowered Amanda who had been able to lift a few tons - but had also clearly felt the strain as her body wasn\u0026rsquo;t used to handling the super energy. Things had changed quite drastically when Amanda had drunk the potion as her powers were on the same level as Michelle\u0026rsquo;s. What if this bond worked the same way?\n\u0026ldquo;You may have a point there,\u0026rdquo; she eventually admitted. \u0026ldquo;He may benefit from the bond, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible that it\u0026rsquo;s still more effective for me. In that case the only solution would be for him to take the potion\u0026hellip; which is the problem here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not the only solution,\u0026rdquo; JJ calmly said. \u0026ldquo;Give him enough time and he may come around. I mean, from what I see these powers have way more advantages than disadvantages.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle was about to protest, but she realized how stupid that would be. \u0026ldquo;Yeah, you\u0026rsquo;re right.\u0026rdquo; She rose into the air, still in a sitting position while sticking out her chest. \u0026ldquo;I mean given enough time, who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to be like that?\u0026rdquo;\nJJ only nodded in response and Michelle quickly figured the reason behind it.\n\u0026ldquo;How about you? Would you want to be like this?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked.\nNow JJ outright froze. Michelle watched her sibling clearly struggle with the answer.\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; uhm, wow, I mean, I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect you to ask me.\u0026rdquo; JJ\u0026rsquo;s stammering would have brought a smile to Michelle\u0026rsquo;s face if it she weren\u0026rsquo;t that interested in the answer. Now that she had asked the question, she really didn\u0026rsquo;t want to hear a no. When she had asked Amanda the latter had declined - and drunk the potion a whole day later. James wasn\u0026rsquo;t that fond of it, too. So far it seemed like anybody given the choice would chose not to do it - while she herself never had a choice.\n\u0026ldquo;So?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d be lying if I said I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to,\u0026rdquo; JJ admitted. \u0026ldquo;But there\u0026rsquo;s more to be considered here\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And that would be?\u0026rdquo;\nBefore JJ could answer they were interrupted by the distinct sound of keys that were about to be used to open a door.\n\u0026ldquo;Kelly,\u0026rdquo; JJ announced.\nMichelle acted quickly, and silently flew into the next room. She would have flown right out of the window hadn\u0026rsquo;t JJ closed it earlier - and despite her speed she wasn\u0026rsquo;t capable of opening it quick and silent.\nSo she did the next best thing and hid in the first room she found - only to realize it was the bathroom. A quick glance to the bathroom window revealed that it was too small for her to slip through it. Michelle gulped as she realized that as long as she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be found, she was stuck here.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part14/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 14"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"Michelle stared at the container, trying to process the events of the last hours.\nWhat had started with her trying to learn how to be super, yet look normal, had soon turned into her having to rescue her boyfriend from another woman with the same kind of powers she had.\nThe whole ordeal came with a lot of new revelations, and a few spoils of war to boot. For one, there was a container of super potion that she had taken from the lab where James worked. It was proof that the scientists there had access to another superpower granting plant and would now obviously redouble their research efforts. Michelle had taken this container not to stock up on super potion, though. Hell she already had enough to be able to share it with her best friend, so it obviously wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessary for her to get more. If it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the one side-effect that turned those who drank the potion of the same plant into - for the lack of a better word - siblings\u0026hellip; this batch wasn\u0026rsquo;t meant for her, but for her boyfriend. The naughty part of her brain already imagined how their lovemaking might be if they were on the same level.\nHowever, the other spoils of war weren\u0026rsquo;t much to her liking. During her fight with Susan, she had managed to convince the latter to transfer all her super energy to Michelle, leaving her with a lot of extra energy. And with this extra energy came whatever individual powers Susan had developed on her own. Michelle knew that this woman had the ability to control other people\u0026rsquo;s minds, and that she had done so mostly subconsciously. For someone who valued the freedom of the mind as much as Michelle, this power-up felt more like a curse that she would never use. Still, another of Susan\u0026rsquo;s apparent unique abilities disturbed her even more. Even after transferring all her energy to Michelle, the other woman had not transformed into however she had looked originally. If that was also an individual ability of hers, then Michelle was probably just as stuck in her super form. In that case her double life, as a reporter at day and a superheroine at night, was over already - after only a few days.\nHer only comfort right now was that it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like that at all. Michelle could feel something new, but was pretty convinced that this was the mind-control power she had gained. But nothing that would refrain her from transforming back to normal from what she could tell. Still, the issue ate at her, and Michelle needed an answer. Sitting cross-legged above her couch, she closed her eyes and entered the place where she expected to find the answer.\nShe was quite familiar with the white space now, so it didn\u0026rsquo;t surprise her when her doppelganger greeted her with a warm smile. It was this familiarity that made her notice the difference right away. Where before her doppelgänger had looked exactly like herself, she now had\u0026hellip; slight differences in her appearance. Her hair seemed a bit darker with a strange hint of green and her normally blue eyes had a greenish tint.\nThese changes confirmed Michelle\u0026rsquo;s suspicions. This doppelganger wasn\u0026rsquo;t a part of herself, after all. Neither was she a personification of her instincts nor a split personality. She was the plant that had given her these powers in the first place.\n\u0026ldquo;You look good,\u0026rdquo; Michelle commented the changes on her doppelganger.\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, you too,\u0026rdquo; came the answer.\nMichelle now noticed that her doppelganger wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only one looking different this time. She herself was in her super form instead of her original appearance.\n\u0026ldquo;As always I come here with a bunch of questions for you,\u0026rdquo; she began. \u0026ldquo;I tried to learn how to be in my normal form while still having super energy inside me. But it appears there are limits to that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed there are,\u0026rdquo; her doppelganger confirmed. \u0026ldquo;And I fear that your attempts may be futile in the end.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you referring to the powers I absorbed from this other woman? She didn\u0026rsquo;t transform back despite having no energy left, right?\u0026rdquo;\nHer doppelganger looked upwards in thought, probably reliving Michelle\u0026rsquo;s memories right now.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes and no. You believe that her staying in this form was some kind of individual power she created, while in truth it was one that you possessed all along.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Like flying and super strength? This doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense. I\u0026rsquo;ve transformed back whenever I ran out of super energy. I even managed to do it voluntarily.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you are still able to do that,\u0026rdquo; her doppelganger explained. \u0026ldquo;This woman merely triggered the reaction that closes the door to her former self while you have yet to do so.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What kind of reaction are you talking about?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She had reached the point where she couldn\u0026rsquo;t store any more energy. This marks the point where the normal form outlives its usefulness and she stays in her improved form even when out of power.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The point where she couldn\u0026rsquo;t store any more energy?\u0026rdquo; Michelle remembered that Susan had drunk a huge amount of the potion from the container she had brought. Apparently this had triggered the effect. \u0026ldquo;So if I drink too much of the potion or absorb too much energy, I will be stuck in this form too? But why?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This smaller form uses up less energy, but also a limited capacity. You learned that yourself: your smaller form can store a limited amount before you either transform or eject the extra super energy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean when I suddenly leaked super powered breast milk.\u0026rdquo;\nHer doppelganger nodded. \u0026ldquo;Your super form can store a lot more super energy, but that too has a limit. Reaching that limit causes the cells that make up the difference between both forms to be permanently active, making it impossible to change back.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So in other words this is meant to happen? At one point I am bound to reach this point and be stuck like this for the rest of my life?\u0026rdquo;\nHer doppelganger nodded. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. This isn\u0026rsquo;t what you wanted to hear, is it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be sorry,\u0026rdquo; Michelle answered out of reflex. \u0026ldquo;I guess the evolution had little reason to consider the advantages of a double identity anyway. Not to mention that being stuck like this is far from the worst thing that could happen to me.\u0026rdquo;\nA smile appeared on her doppelganger\u0026rsquo;s face. It was so genuine that Michelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but respond in kind as the white space faded away\nOpening her eyes again, Michelle had some new-found confidence. All she had to do was not absorb too much super energy, which sounded easy enough. And if it proved inevitable, she still had some time to prepare for that.\nDeziree sighed as she finally reached her apartment. Today had been the officially weirdest day of her life. She kicked off the heels that had caused her to sprain her ankle earlier. Thanks to the \u0026ldquo;Angel\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; magical bandage, she didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any pain in her foot right now. Actually, she didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any physical pain at all. Mentally, however, the whole ordeal had taken its toll on her. After all, she had not encountered one, but two godlike women whose simple appearance made her even more self-conscious than usual. Not to mention that one of them had tried to kill her.\nShe decided to take a bath to cope with today\u0026rsquo;s events. Her clothes had suffered through the whole ordeal as well, with her partially ripped-off tights and the ruined backside of her blouse, she had preferred to wear a lab coat on her way home. Now in the privacy of her apartment, she quickly took off her clothes and inspected the damage her body had suffered today.\n\u0026ldquo;Ouch,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed as she saw the numerous cuts and bruises that marked her back. Considering she had been thrown across a hallway, she considered herself lucky.\nLying down in the water, she thought about how unfair this seemed. Susan Harland had suddenly gotten herself some super powers and received a killer body as a bonus even when her powers were taken from her. Or had they worn off? Deziree didn\u0026rsquo;t know for sure. But what she did know for sure was that Susan was the least fitting for this kind of powers. The spoiled brat that she was, she had used these powers for nothing but trouble, and it was lucky that she hadn\u0026rsquo;t killed anyone.\nThen again Deziree herself couldn\u0026rsquo;t really complain. That magical bandage was somehow taking away the pain she should be suffering now, and Susan was eventually stopped and was now on her way to rot in a cell. And not without leaving some kind of reparation too. Deziree smiled as she thought about that. When Susan had drunk the strange liquid from the plant, she had exclaimed \u0026ldquo;too much\u0026rdquo; before she had started to lactate. Since Detective Spencer had been knocked out cold, Deziree had been the only one to witness that. She had managed to fill the milk into a few vials and sneak them out of the lab.\nNow her thoughts trailed back to the theories she had about that. \u0026ldquo;Too much\u0026rdquo; obviously referred to the amount of liquid Susan had drunk. Even before learning about super powers, she had suspected that the liquid served as nutrition of some kind - similar to the milk of mammals. In short, Deziree suspected the milk to have a similar effect as the liquid. In fact, it could even be better adapted to the human body.\nThere was only one problem here: this was just a theory. She had no chance to analyze the milk for similarities and had impulsively decided to sneak it out. Now the only way for her to find out would be to drink it and see what happened. Would it transform her into a goddess like Susan and the Angel had been? Or would it be smarter to sneak it back in and make an analysis first? But there was no guarantee that she would be able to sneak it out again\u0026hellip;\nDuring her whole bath, Deziree thought about little else. The longer she thought about it, the more she considered the negative consequences of drinking it prematurely. Taking it slow and safe would be the best way to go after all. She got out of her bath and while she dried herself, she looked at her reflection in the mirror. Aside from today\u0026rsquo;s wounds, her appearance was … plain. Her glasses and mousy hair gave her a kind of cute librarian look, but the rest of her body wasn\u0026rsquo;t much to speak of. She was small in every possible way and lacked any womanly curves.\nShe frowned. Compared to the goddesses she had witnessed today, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t even worth the breath it would take to ridicule her. Looking at her mirror image further, she began wondering how she would look if she were in their shoes. Why exactly did she want to play it safe again? Those women probably had no time to analyze things beforehand either, and she had spent three months examining that plant.\nWith newfound confidence, Deziree walked into her room to get one of the vials containing the milk. Stepping in front of her full-length mirror, she gave her naked reflection one final stare as she opened the vial. \u0026ldquo;Good bye!\u0026rdquo; she said before downing the milk.\nThe first thing she noticed was how sweet the milk tasted, but also another taste that she couldn\u0026rsquo;t immediately put into perspective. For a moment she felt disgusted at herself for so readily drinking someone else\u0026rsquo;s breast milk. That disgust however was short-lived as she immediately felt her stomach react to the liquid and a wave of dizziness came over her. Deziree was convinced that this was a good sign and considered sitting down, but she wanted to see the whole show and didn\u0026rsquo;t intend to step away from the mirror.\nIt didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for the dizziness to grow weaker. What replaced it however, was pain. To be precise, it was a headache. And although it was a small and rather tolerable one, Deziree realized that it was probably quite a significant pain as she looked down at the magical bandage. How much pain would she be feeling right now without it?\nThe more Deziree thought about it, the more she realized how much clearer she could think at all. Oh it was so clear now! The headache was caused by her brain being enhanced. After all, the superhumans had shown a wide array of abilities that the human brain wasn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to handle, so it was only natural for it to adapt. She giggled, staring at her still unchanged reflection as she felt her sight getting worse. True, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t wearing her glasses right now, but her sight was getting blurrier and then disappeared altogether.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed. Fortunately her blindness wasn\u0026rsquo;t permanent, and once her sight returned, the pain left her head altogether. As she could make out her mirror image again, she immediately noticed that her eyesight had returned much better than it had been before. Now she could see a lot better than with her glasses, being able to make out details that she couldn\u0026rsquo;t before. As she watched at her face, she noticed that her eyes didn\u0026rsquo;t look the way they used to. Her greyish blue eyes had been replaced by vibrant green ones that glowed in their own light similar to what she had seen with the other superwomen.\nDeziree stared at her mirror image, dumbfounded. Was it really happening? Was she really just in the process of becoming some sort of goddess? God she needed to pay attention to every tiny change that was going to happen from now on. Not only her eyes, but her face had changed as well already, having become downright gorgeous. She began to imagine herself in a body fitting that. A body like those women she had encountered today possessed, with the killer physique and this gorgeous hair.\nHair\u0026hellip; Deziree\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened as she felt a strange surge going into her head, followed by tingle on her scalp and then saw in the mirror image how it began falling down to the ground. She watched the fall in what felt like slow motion. Her hair, mousy at it was, was no longer part of her body. With utter disbelief she watched the pile of hair lying next to her feet, her thoughts racing, desperately trying to find an answer.\nAnd they found it. She remembered this morning during the briefing, there had been talk about a how a drug-addicted prostitute had been the first documented case of this kind of mutation. They had found a large amount of unmutated hair in her apartment. Apparently this was a natural course of the transformation. This thought calmed Deziree down and she allowed herself to smile again.\nAs her gaze was still directed at her feet, she noticed that the magical bandage showed a strange glow now. Focusing harder, she saw how that glow faintly shimmered into her body, and she came to the conclusion that this was what had numbed the pain all this time. Actually that glow reminded her of the one in her eyes, and she put two and two together: This was what allowed the supers to do what they did. Deziree was surprised at how exciting this whole deal was becoming.\nFeeling a strange sensation in her scalp, she looked back up to see that hair had begun to sprout again on her head. Her smile grew brighter as she noticed that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the mousy greyish brown she had before, but a vibrant black. The sight of it growing so quickly was rather unreal yet at the same time it felt so natural. Deziree could even make out the strange glow at the roots of her hair that was probably the cause of that quick growth. Soon her hair had reached its original length and continued to grow further, reaching down her back. Deziree was beside herself. Her hair was clearly on its way to be on par with that of Susan and the Angel.\nAnd what started with her eyes and hair would clearly apply for her whole body eventually. Right down to her genes. Deziree\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened again as the scientific significance of the current situation became obvious to her. She had initiated her own mutation into some sort of half-human-half-alien-plant-hybrid. No matter how impressive the outcome, the process itself was still one of the biggest wonders she could think of at the top of her head. And it would only happen to her this one time.\nThis trail of thoughts increased her curiosity even further. She needed to pay utmost attention now; no sensation, no tiny difference was allowed to be unnoticed. As she thought about that, she suddenly noticed the mirror as well as her reflection disappearing as she saw the wall behind it, then the wall behind that\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed as she got accustomed to using her newfound X-ray vision. Focusing on her own body again, she was surprised as she was able to see the insides of it - even making out the strange glow inside her. She felt another surge going through her body and more importantly saw that it consisted of the same strange glow - although in a slightly different color.\nThe effects of that surge didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for her to notice. Slowly but surely, she saw the cells in her body divide themselves quicker, as her body gained some height. It was unbelievable. Even though she had seen the outcome before, it was utterly unreal to see her body change from within, getting taller than her original 5'2\u0026quot; with increasing speed. On top of that, Deziree was surprised that there was absolutely no pain during the process, even though she expected such a procedure to be torture. Another part she noticed, that while she was growing, she merely gained in size. Her skinny body was still far from the toned amazons she had witnessed today. This didn\u0026rsquo;t really bother her; so far the transformation had happened body part by body part.\nShe intently watched every part of her growth until she had passed the six foot mark and the growth slowed. Once it stopped, Deziree yearned for the next part to happen. Right now she was slim and tall, but still skinny, while the goddesses she had met before were everything but. Sure enough she felt another surge and saw how the energy washed over her body again, concentrating in her muscles. A wicked smile crossed her face as the next step was obvious.\nThe feeling as her muscles began to grow was incredible. While before the lack of pain had surprised her, the pleasure now had utterly taken her off-guard. Oh, she could get used to this! Especially since she knew that no matter how strong she would look, her actual strength would be far greater. Remembering her own astonishment as she had seen the news about the Angel this very morning, she allowed herself to laugh. \u0026ldquo;Strong enough to lift a freaking plane,\u0026rdquo; she commented as the growth picked up the pace and she saw her abs gaining definition.\nDeziree had a hard time deciding where to look as the process happened all over her body. The cells making up her muscle tissue divided themselves at an alarming rate, causing her to gain more and more mass. She also noticed that some cells seemed a lot smaller than others and was quickly reminded of the moment she had witnessed Susan drinking the liquid from the plant. At one point her muscles had seemed to inflate before shrinking back down. Could it be that both she and the Angel were even stronger than she had anticipated so far? From the looks of it, Deziree concluded that these cells - if grown to normal size - would cause a massive bulk up.\nTruth be told, the feats of strength she had witnessed already were more than enough for her. It was the fact that she was now officially hot that mattered to her. And the feeling of her muscles growing was strangely arousing. Deziree let out a slight gasp. Not only was she becoming one hell of a hot chick, she already felt sexier than ever before in her life. Her thoughts raced. The growth process obviously stimulated her from the inside out, and with her added senses it was outright arousing. Things got even better when more muscle groups joined the fray, including those situated in her most private parts. From one moment to the next, her pussy began to tingle in rhythm with her growth.\nBy now her body had taken on fitness model proportions and Deziree loved every bit of it. At one point she had deactivated her X-ray vision to appreciate her mirror image. It was simply astonishing. Even though Deziree had a very good understanding of what was happening on a rational level, the feelings going through her body as it was magically changing into a hot amazon was simply unbelievable. She felt the growth coming to a stop and mentally compared herself to the goddesses she had encountered today. Deziree was close to them now, at least when it came to size and physique. Her pretty face was also on par with the others, while her dark hair was just a matter of taste. Those who preferred blondes would surely prefer the others over her, but those who preferred dark-haired women would chose her. There was just one part where she was still underdeveloped. Well, two parts.\nLooking down at her bare A-cup breasts, she reactivated her X-ray vision just in time to watch and feel the next surge of energy go straight into them. \u0026ldquo;Oooh,\u0026rdquo; she moaned at the sensations that came with it. If her muscle growth felt like a slow yet intimate massage of her whole body, this felt as if someone began to both fondle and suck on her breasts at the same time. At least that was how she imagined it would feel like. It was harder and harder for her to focus on the scientific parts of her transformation. After years of feeling undersized, her breasts were finally about to grow.\nFirst her nipples became erect, and grew in size, then her whole breasts followed suit. Deziree was surprised by the speed at which it happened. The growth of her muscularity had been a slow, yet pleasurable process, while her breasts expanded on a much quicker rate. And the feeling of it was indescribable. Deziree let out a series of moans as she grew past the C-cup range and well into the D-cup in mere seconds. Her arousal reached heights that she didn\u0026rsquo;t consider humanly possible - and what was left of her rational thought concluded that this was probably another benefit of her transformation. Still, even she had her trouble withstanding all the unexpected pleasure, so she was relieved when her breasts had reached their final size which she estimated to be DD.\nStanding in front of her mirror, Deziree confirmed that her body now fully resembled those of the other supers she had encountered. From the looks of it, she was now officially one of them. She blushed at the realization of how aroused she still was, and tried to find a distraction. Focusing once again on the bandage that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been impressed by her growth, she noticed that she could outright feel the energy still contained within. Suddenly she felt an urge … she wanted that power, she needed it. And the moment she thought that, the bandage began to dissolve, as the energy inside it moved into her now fully healed foot and crept upwards her leg to distribute itself over her entire body. At the same time, she felt much more of the same energy slowly beginning to build up, engulfing her whole body.\nDeziree closed her eyes to try to figure out the details, but she quickly got lost in these feelings. This energy now felt like power itself, settling into each and every cell. It was like a thirst she didn\u0026rsquo;t know she had suddenly being satisfied. This power that so far had changed her body from that of a plain Jane to a sexy goddess was now becoming part of her. For a few intense seconds, this feeling continued to wash over her body, constantly increasing her arousal until it filled her whole body. This was it: the transformation was complete.\nOpening her eyes again, Deziree smiled as she took another look at her mirror image. The woman who stared back at her hadn\u0026rsquo;t changed on the outside, but was now giving out the same glow of power that she had seen in her eyes first. As she gave her body another once-over, she noticed that her feet had left the ground, leaving her hovering in midair.\n\u0026ldquo;Unbelievable,\u0026rdquo; she commented this new revelation as her mind was still numbed by the sheer pleasure she was experiencing. Deziree began tracing her hands over her newly transformed body, feeling the hard-cut muscle that was right underneath her flawless skin, all with her enhanced sense of touch. With a wicked smile, she led her hand to her pussy and let out a gasp at the sensation she felt. The arousal that had started to dissipate came back with full force as she shamelessly began to play with herself.\nDeziree leaned back, one hand on her breast, another between her legs, both massaging her most sensitive parts. Now hovering in a horizontal position, she threw all rational thinking overboard. Engulfed in her own pleasure, Deziree didn\u0026rsquo;t even realize the forces she used on her own body. The hand that massaged her breast did so with a force that could crush steel, while the one between her legs, vibrated at super speed. To her, however, this felt like a normal speed as her senses had kicked into overdrive, distorting her sense of time. To her, seconds lasted minutes, so when she reached her climax five seconds later, it had felt like a whole five minutes of masturbation.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh\u0026hellip; god\u0026hellip; ahhh,\u0026rdquo; she moaned as her wave after wave of orgasmic pleasure went through her, maintaining peak intensity for well over a minute - that lasted an hour from her perspective. Finally, she felt her orgasm subside and her senses return to normal.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed as she had finally gotten down from her high - figuratively, of course, as she was still airborne. She \u0026lsquo;sat up\u0026rsquo; Indian style and tried to assess the situation. She had really done it! Drinking this milk had given her a super-hot body with a bunch of superpowers along the way. Concentrating on her flight, Deziree rose a bit higher, then descended a bit lower, turned around to fly upside down - it was all so easy, as if she had been born to do that. And the liberating feeling of being weightless\u0026hellip; no wonder Susan had preferred to hover through the lab, not even trying to hide these powers. Deziree would have a hard time keeping her feet on the ground herself as she began forming her plans for the night.\n\u0026ldquo;How was your day?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked seductively and with a kiss that made it impossible for James to verbally answer for several seconds. She had flown over to his place, and thanks to their mental connection, he had opened the window in advance, allowing her to drop by quick enough to make it impossible for neighbors to notice her.\n\u0026ldquo;W-wow, you kiss me like I was the big hero instead of you,\u0026rdquo; James commented after they broke the kiss.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just happy to see you, that\u0026rsquo;s all.\u0026rdquo; Michelle answered, her seductive smile still in place. \u0026ldquo;Plus, I think we have something to celebrate.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The destruction of a multimillion dollar lab?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh come on, don\u0026rsquo;t be like that,\u0026rdquo; Michelle feigned a frown.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just messing with you,\u0026rdquo; he chuckled. \u0026ldquo;If it weren\u0026rsquo;t for you, who knows how much more damage that Harland girl would have caused.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thou shalt be forgiven.\u0026rdquo; she laughed, before she took on a more serious tone. \u0026ldquo;But kidding aside, something is on your mind\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re inside my head again, huh?\u0026rdquo; he answered weakly. \u0026ldquo;Guess I can\u0026rsquo;t complain. You can\u0026rsquo;t help it and today this bond basically saved my life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not doing it on purpose, which is why I only know something is on your mind, not what exactly it is.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The fact that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot on my mind right now helps a lot there,\u0026rdquo; he sighed. \u0026ldquo;And I have to say, the chaos allowed me to perform a few tests, I otherwise wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh? What kind of tests?\u0026rdquo; Now Michelle was curious. Any test result about herself would help her understand herself a bit more.\n\u0026ldquo;Well first things first, I managed to snatch a strand of hair from Ms. Harland, and it seems she got her powers from the same source as the other women we heard of: the drug addicted prostitute, the Asian and of course Ms. Riley.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You managed all of that in such a short time? And what Asian?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh yeah, remember that man that was severely hurt after what seems like intercourse with a superwoman? According to the DNA she was Asian. The analysis of the other women was already done this morning. All I had to do was a quick test with Ms. Harland.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see. So they all gained their powers from the same man\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hm, yeah Jacob mentioned something like that as well. That a man would be the link between the women. He assumed that he empowered them in order to sleep with them. Sounds quite plausible to me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, Susan\u0026rsquo;s story basically confirmed that.\u0026rdquo;\nJames gave her a strange look to which Michelle added. \u0026ldquo;What? You think I turn her over to the police without interrogating her first?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So what did she say?\u0026rdquo; James asked.\n\u0026ldquo;She didn\u0026rsquo;t drink any kind of potion, or at least she didn\u0026rsquo;t notice. From what she told me, she transformed after having sex with a man who seemed to be super as well.\u0026rdquo;\nJames face paled. \u0026ldquo;No potion? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense. I mean these powers aren\u0026rsquo;t exactly sexually transferrable. Hell, I\u0026rsquo;m living proof that they aren\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t really understand this either. He probably slipped it to her without her noticing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well if he was super it would be easy for him to do so.\u0026rdquo; James thought out loud.\n\u0026ldquo;But there\u0026rsquo;s something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense,\u0026rdquo; Michelle interrupted. \u0026ldquo;Why make her super after sleeping with her? That just sounds plain wrong to me!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s indeed strange. Did she mention any reason why he did that?\u0026rdquo; James asked.\n\u0026ldquo;No, he only said that she should have fun, but in a strange distant kind of way. Like he didn\u0026rsquo;t even care about that. It\u0026rsquo;s totally strange that he even shared these powers at all. I mean, would you do that in his situation?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um,\u0026rdquo; James hesitated for a few seconds. \u0026ldquo;Well if I didn\u0026rsquo;t care for the woman at all, then I sure as hell wouldn\u0026rsquo;t slip her some super potion.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly,\u0026rdquo; Michelle agreed with a smile. \u0026ldquo;And what would you do if you cared for her?\u0026rdquo;\nJames gulped loud enough that it didn\u0026rsquo;t take Michelle\u0026rsquo;s heightened senses to hear it. She didn\u0026rsquo;t like this reaction.\n\u0026ldquo;Well… um… I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t give her the potion at all.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle\u0026rsquo;s face darkened as she heard that and James hastily continued.\n\u0026ldquo;I mean look at it from this angle. The potion would change her in quite the dramatic way, making her a potential target of people interested in examining the potion and its effects on humans.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The potion would also allow her to easily escape anybody trying to hunt her,\u0026rdquo; Michelle countered.\nJames sighed. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re not talking about that strange man anymore, are we?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle shook her head.\n\u0026ldquo;Figured as much. I take it you brought the super potion you took from the lab earlier?\u0026rdquo;\nHe pointed at the bag Michelle had brought.\nA few seconds of silence passed. He was right as Michelle had indeed brought a dose of that potion, a dose that didn\u0026rsquo;t come from the same plant as her own.\n\u0026ldquo;So, if I asked you to take it, you would decline?\u0026rdquo; Michelle\u0026rsquo;s question barely hid the disappointment she was already feeling.\n\u0026ldquo;I know that\u0026rsquo;s not what you want to hear, but yes I would decline.\u0026rdquo;\nShe had been secretly looking forward to the idea of having an equally powerful partner ever since her first transformation, and now that she had both a boyfriend and some potion that could fulfill her wish, she really didn\u0026rsquo;t want him to decline.\n\u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; She asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I already told you. The changes to the DNA aren\u0026rsquo;t something to be trifled with. We have two fatalities already that were directly caused by the potion and not just someone misusing the power that comes with it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;One of them was a drug addict who got clean without knowing it and tried her usual dose anyway! If she had known that, then this could have been her ticket out of that addiction!\u0026rdquo; Michelle\u0026rsquo;s voice became louder as she spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;And the other one died due to a very small genetic flaw that had shortened her lifespan considerably already. Who knows what other flaws could blow up in our faces?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This…,\u0026rdquo; Michelle stopped herself from simply screaming nonsense back at him. Fortunately her enhanced senses allowed her to regain her composure almost immediately. \u0026ldquo;Look, it may sound hard to believe but I am hundred percent certain that nothing like this would happen to you. For all I can say it\u0026rsquo;s instinctive, but so far my instincts were always right. After all they warned me not to give you the same potion I use. I only knew it was wrong, but you told me that this was because we would turn into some kind of siblings if we did that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And now that you found a fitting alternative, you think things are going to be fine?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I think if there were some complications to be expected, I would feel it somehow.\u0026rdquo;\nJames sighed. \u0026ldquo;My answer remains the same.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But…\u0026rdquo; Michelle bit her lip, barely hiding her disappointment. This definitely wasn\u0026rsquo;t how she had imagined things to go. \u0026ldquo;Just imagine what we could do together,\u0026rdquo; she began seductively. \u0026ldquo;Our lovemaking would be out of this world.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously?\u0026rdquo; James snapped back. \u0026ldquo;Is that all you can think of right now? People died because of this stuff! Hell, your best friend found a body today, I almost got killed by a superpowered spoiled brat, and all you can think about is sex?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Amanda is a tough girl, she\u0026rsquo;s doing fine. And by the way you\u0026rsquo;re welcome,\u0026rdquo; Michelle retorted. Slowly but surely her disappointment was replaced with anger. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t follow his logic at all. Why did he have to be against it?\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re missing the point here! This is far too serious a step for me to take it just because you want to get knocked up!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What? That\u0026rsquo;s not what I meant!\u0026rdquo; Michelle shouted back.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe you didn\u0026rsquo;t mean it consciously. But the truth is your instincts are easy to see through. What your instincts want is to mate with a member of your own species, a man that has the same kind of mutation that you have and that could technically impregnate you. Right now, I don\u0026rsquo;t fulfill these criteria.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Member of my own species\u0026hellip;,\u0026rdquo; Michelle repeated angrily. \u0026ldquo;So that\u0026rsquo;s what you think of me? A nonhuman freak?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t say that!\u0026rdquo; James retorted hastily. \u0026ldquo;I just referred to the mutation you went through. Considering I\u0026rsquo;m working at a research facility that happens to research just that, I am pretty sure I would be found out in no time. After all, even transforming back doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I would go back to who I am now, right?\u0026rdquo;\nBoom\n\u0026ldquo;What the…?\u0026rdquo; James shouted out.\nMichelle didn\u0026rsquo;t answer right away. In the blink of an eye she had punched a nearby wall. Her slender hands had created a sizeable hole as Michelle was now facing away from him, her head hanging low. Slowly she took out the hand from the hole she had created, watching it for a second to make sure she had indeed not even broke a nail. Her vision became blurry however as the reason for her outburst came back to her and tears formed in her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;You just keep going on why you don\u0026rsquo;t want to take it… seriously I had hoped for a bit more support here.\u0026rdquo;\nShe didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be seen crying in front of him, so turned around, making her way to the window through which she came.\n\u0026ldquo;Michelle wait\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; James started, not really understanding what she meant with that.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll fix the wall,\u0026rdquo; she said as calmly as she could. \u0026ldquo;But I need some time alone.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd before James could say any more, she had super speeded out of the apartment.\nIn the darkness of the night, the lab had a certain horror movie vibe going for it. Deziree remembered how today it had actually turned into one of the most dangerous places on earth as the mutated Susan Harland had gone on a rampage only to be stopped by the Angel. Their battle had been quite destructive, and Deziree had feared for her life - and not without reason. But now things were different. Now she was the one with the super powers roaming the lab. And unlike Susan, she had no intention of causing a huge mess, not even for the watchmen that patrolled the facility now.\nActually, this was the part that made Deziree most nervous. After all, she could hardly identify herself as someone who worked here with access to go to the lower levels. Even if the guards believed her that would mark the end of her career.\nBack at home, when she had wondered if her powers could serve her to get in and out unnoticed, the answer had presented itself. A strange tingle had washed over her body and Deziree\u0026rsquo;s mirror image had disappeared. It hadn\u0026rsquo;t taken long for the young scientist to figure out that she had the ability to turn invisible and how to access it. Hovering naked through the hallways was a strange sensation, especially when she encountered a guard on patrol.\nThe man obviously couldn\u0026rsquo;t see her, but he did seem to be aware that something was up. Floating up to the ceiling and lying flat against it, Deziree waited until he walked past her, but this guy decided to come to a halt right under her. She didn\u0026rsquo;t waste any time and flew over him the moment he stopped, but despite the fact that she didn\u0026rsquo;t make any sound, he seemed to have noticed her. The guard looked upwards to where Deziree had passed him, and the superpowered brunette noticed the tent in his pants.\nOh my god, she thought, putting two and two together. She may be invisible and took extra care of not making any sound, but her scent was still present. Now that she figured that out, she noticed that the man wasn\u0026rsquo;t really paying attention to his surroundings anymore, but apparently was quite distracted by what he smelled. Of course, her scent was laden with her pheromones and like everything else on her, they were super.\nNow that was an interesting revelation. The scope of her sexiness was even greater than she had imagined. Guys didn\u0026rsquo;t even have to see her to be incredibly turned on. She wondered what would happen if she turned visible again. The thought of a supernaturally sexy naked chick materializing in front of him would probably drive him over the edge in an instant. Considering that she was still a virgin - and not by choice - this was one hell of a game changer. Still, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the moment for her to catch up on that.\nDeziree continued her silent flight through the hallways and eventually reached her lab. Fortunately, it was unguarded even though a certain amount of the battle had happened here. The giant holes in the wall that Susan\u0026rsquo;s body had created had the benefit of making Deziree\u0026rsquo;s break-in all the easier, as well as being able to see perfectly in the dark. Looking through the lab, she spotted the wall behind which the plant was sealed. Deziree willed it transparent, allowing her to see the superpower-granting alien plant as if hidden behind transparent glass instead of solid steel.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; she whispered in admiration. Her impromptu test proved that she was able to see through walls just fine, even spotting the secret vault where she had sent the containers with the plants liquid earlier. Those were the reason she had come here tonight. After the Susan had promptly drunk a large amount of this stuff only to leak her milk in the process and the Angel taking with her the rest of that container, there was no doubt that this stuff was what gave them super powers. But how to get it? Sure she could use her access codes to get it out, but any access was logged and thus traceable to her. Apparently she would have to use force and rip open the underground vault.\nShe chuckled. Ripping open a high security vault? God, that sounded crazy, but then again so did the idea that a woman could fly through the sky and lift a freaking plane. The vault should be feasible for her. In fact, it was the best way to test out how strong she really was. So much for sneaky, she thought.\nTraveling to the level below her lab didn\u0026rsquo;t present any challenge now. With her newly found X-ray vision Deziree was now able to spot the guards through the walls - and there were none in her way anyway. A few minutes later she was standing in front of the vault door. Noticing a security camera above it, she stared at it intently as it was impossible for her to open the vault without getting filmed, even though she herself was invisible. She felt some of the super energy enter her eyes and… boom… two beams of green light had shot out of them and destroyed the camera.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; she shouted out, as she saw the destruction her eyes could cause. She would need to be extra careful with her new powers, that was for sure. Still, the vault door was closed and waited for her to test her strength on it. Touching down on the floor, Deziree walked towards the door and put her hands around it. The thick steel felt just as immovable as she had expected it to be, but Deziree convinced herself that she could do that. As she applied more pressure, she could feel the energy inside her moving into her muscles boosting her strength to levels she had yet to figure out.\nDeziree took her time, the scientist part of her curious to find out what exactly her body was doing right now. She found herself strangely aware about her increasing strength and could feel that there was a lot of muscle tissue that seemed inactive. Remembering earlier today, Deziree recalled the effect the overdose of the potion had on Susan. The other woman had seemed to grow a lot more muscular before shrinking down to normal again.\nAs she thought about that, Deziree wondered if she could grow to these kind of proportions as well - and her body responded in kind. The young botanist could feel a wave of super energy going into the dormant muscle cells all over her body and instantly felt herself grow to bodybuilder-like proportions. From one moment to the next she went from slowly applying pressure onto the thick vault door to using all the strength her body could muster.\nBoom\nThe sudden noise caught Deziree off-guard and it took her enhanced mind a whole three seconds to process what had happened. Her hands, slender as they were had ripped through the solid steel door like it was made of paper. Instead of just forcing the door open, she had torn it to shreds. This was a vault door created to withstand the explosive force of pretty much everything short of a nuclear warhead. And she had simply ripped it apart as if it were made of paper.\nAwestruck by the raw power she had displayed just now, Deziree proceeded to create an opening large enough for her to get through. Now better controlling her strength, she was rewarded with a screeching sound as the steel protested uselessly against the force she applied to bend it. A few seconds later the door had been deformed beyond repair and Deziree allowed herself to relax again, feeling her body shrinking down a bit as the extra muscles turned inactive again.\nShe marveled at her handiwork. A solid vault door hadn\u0026rsquo;t even proven any resistance to her. Deziree quickly spotted the two containers she had managed to secure this afternoon. With the vault door gone she could see the faint glow of the power inside it, but she was actually surprised to see how faint it was. Apparently the sturdy container made it harder for her to spot the otherwise invisible energy. Activating her X-ray vision she could see the liquid inside it but the super energy itself wasn\u0026rsquo;t visible anymore. This meant that while supers like her could see the super energy, not even their X-ray vision would allow them to see it through the walls. So while the vault wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have slowed down a possible intruder, it did a good job at hiding the stuff.\nPicking up the large containers, Deziree found it rather easy not to use too much force while holding them. She also remembered that these containers were heavy enough for her to struggle with them when she was still normal. Now that she had what she came for, Deziree turned around and back through the vault door she had opened.\n\u0026ldquo;Freeze!\u0026rdquo; came a shout from the front. Apparently Deziree had forgotten about the silent alarm that would go off when the vault was damaged. Or maybe the destroyed camera had caught some attention. Whatever it was, one of the guards she had avoided before, was standing there and pointed a gun at her.\nDeziree\u0026rsquo;s first reaction was a slight hint of panic and she did as told. She had been so absorbed in her feats of strength that she didn\u0026rsquo;t notice that she had become visible. The gun wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be much of a threat to her, but her plan of going in and out unnoticed had failed.\n\u0026ldquo;Put down those containers!\u0026rdquo; the man ordered.\nMore out of habit than out of genuine fear, Deziree dropped the two containers and with a loud clang they landed on the ground.\n\u0026ldquo;What the?\u0026rdquo; the guard was obviously surprised. Dezire figured that he must\u0026rsquo;ve expected them to be much lighter judging by the way she had carried them.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, who are you?\u0026rdquo; he asked again, his voice a little shaky.\nThat was a surprise, Deziree hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected to be this intimidating, but she could already see the sweat forming on his forehead, his eyes wandering nervously over her, and his aim wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly steady either. Still, the way he eyed her\u0026hellip;\nDeziree blushed as she realized the true reason for his unease. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t scared of her at all. The tent in his pants was a clear sign that he liked what he saw. Her blush became even more intense as she remembered her own nakedness. This man didn\u0026rsquo;t even need her superpowered pheromones to affect him in order to get horny. And he wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly unattractive.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d rather not say my name,\u0026rdquo; Deziree answered. \u0026ldquo;And as you can see I don\u0026rsquo;t have an ID with me.\u0026rdquo;\nShe could clearly hear the man\u0026rsquo;s heartbeat begin to pick up the pace, his eyes wandering over her body with ever increasing lust. Deziree didn\u0026rsquo;t know whether or not she liked that. In fact this was the first time she ever got that kind of attention from a man. And given that she had become super specifically in order to finally be noticed by the other gender, this was should make her happy beyond reason. On the other hand, her being naked right now embarrassed her to no end. She had only stayed naked because she was invisible, something that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t apply to anything she touched. Not that she had fitting clothes anyway.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have anything with you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; the man stated the obvious.\u0026ldquo;H-how did you manage to open the vault?\u0026rdquo; He looked at the shredded remains of the massive door and gulped. \u0026ldquo;What the hell happened here?\u0026rdquo; he whispered, obviously expecting her not to hear that.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I ripped it open with my bare hands,\u0026rdquo; Deziree said shyly. She was fully aware of how ridiculous that sounded.\nThe man gulped again and his hand almost began shaking. Apparently he believed her. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t that strange considering he had been patroling a facility that still showed the damage of the fight the Angel and Susan had here. He had little reason to doubt the existence of a woman that could rip open a massive vault, after all.\n\u0026ldquo;Y-you\u0026rsquo;re not kidding, right?\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree shook her head.\n\u0026ldquo;Then what are you here for?\u0026rdquo; the man asked again. \u0026ldquo;W-what is in these containers that you come here?\u0026rdquo;\nNow those were dangerous questions. Deziree was pretty sure he had figured out that the containers included the reason for her super powers. The look on his face remained lustful, but it also showed … greed?\n\u0026ldquo;A woman has to keep her secrets, right?\u0026rdquo; She weakly answered.\n\u0026ldquo;I bet it\u0026rsquo;s what gave you these powers, right?\u0026rdquo; He lowered the gun, and began walking towards her. \u0026ldquo;Why else would you come here and break into a vault that is meant to hold dangerous materials?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And what if it were?\u0026rdquo; Deziree was getting nervous now. Something about the way he acted rubbed her the wrong way.\n\u0026ldquo;Why the angry face,\u0026rdquo; he smoothly said. He came closer, his hands reaching up to her face. \u0026ldquo;A beautiful woman like you looks much better when she smiles.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t touch me!\u0026rdquo; Deziree said and at the same time felt a strange sensation in her eyes.\nHe immediately complied.\nThis surprised Deziree, but then she remembered her own encounter with Susan this afternoon. The other woman had shown some kind of mind control ability and it just sounded logical that she could do that was well. Now this was convenient. This way, she could ask him and he would have to answer honestly and not even remember it.\n\u0026ldquo;Now tell me, what would you do if these containers actually did contain the source of these powers?\u0026rdquo; Deziree asked, her green eyes glowing even more than normal as she spoke. She was getting the hang on how this worked.\n\u0026ldquo;I would talk you into sharing it with me, then sleep with you, having you show me how things worked. Then when you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be looking I would steal the containers from you.\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened. This guy must\u0026rsquo;ve been rotten to the core to even consider this. He intended to use her like a tool. And she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have it. \u0026ldquo;You will forget that I was here and what I took from the vault. You will have no desire of gaining this kind of power, and you will do anything to prevent yourself from getting them. Furthermore you won\u0026rsquo;t hurt people unless it\u0026rsquo;s in self-defense. This also includes other people\u0026rsquo;s feelings, do you understand?\u0026rdquo;\nThe man nodded, and Deziree was confident that her commands had been deeply implanted into his brain. He turned around and walked away, whistling as if he was still patrolling, utterly ignoring the naked superwoman.\n\u0026ldquo;Unbelievable,\u0026rdquo; Deziree whispered. The human mind was basically just a plaything. With this kind of power Susan could have done a lot more damage if she intended to. Deziree was just happy that the other women hadn\u0026rsquo;t done so. Picking up the two containers she made her way out of the lab as quickly as possible.\nOnce she was back flying high over the city, Deziree pondered the situation. The way the guard had acted had been quite disturbing. And the fact that he had seen her naked definitely wasn\u0026rsquo;t part of the plan. Then again it was her own fault for counting on her invisibility alone and then forget to keep it up all time. She tried it again, her body becoming transparent but still visible to her own eyes. The containers however were unaffected, so for a normal person it would seem like they hovered in the air. Any super powered person, however would probably still be able to spot her as the glow of her super energy remained.\nDeziree wondered how she could prevent such an embarrassing moment in the future. Thinking back to this afternoon, Susan had clearly used some thrown together clothes to hold her improved curves and these clothes had not survived the battle. The Angel however had only worn a leotard that hat remained in perfect shape throughout the battle. What the hell had this been made of? Then she remembered the bandage the Angel had created for her\u0026hellip;\nOh god it was so obvious! Deziree wanted to kick herself for not thinking about this sooner. The Angel had willed these clothes into existence! Trying it out herself imagined herself in an elegant red dress that was long, yet showed of her amazing legs with through a slit. Sure enough she felt a tingling all over her body and the dress simply grew out of her. It didn\u0026rsquo;t even take a second and she was wearing the very dress she had imagined. But also she felt the strain that this had caused.\n\u0026ldquo;Nice dress,\u0026rdquo; a voice suddenly spoke behind her.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part13/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 13"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"\u0026ldquo;You have got to be kidding me!\u0026rdquo; Prof. Christopher Harland didn\u0026rsquo;t even try to hide his disappointment.\nJacob couldn\u0026rsquo;t blame him. Even he knew that Harland was always interested in performing an autopsy of a victim of Harland syndrome - as if the name hadn\u0026rsquo;t been a giveaway.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry Professor, but Ms. Riley made herself clear in her will. There\u0026rsquo;s no use complaining about it now.\u0026rdquo; Jacob said this as calmly as he could. He wanted to get as much information as he could from whoever performed the autopsy.\n\u0026ldquo;Detective Spencer is right,\u0026rdquo; came the voice of Prof. Smith - from what Jacob could tell he was the boss here. \u0026ldquo;Ms. Riley specifically excluded you from performing any autopsy on her, so we should respect her will.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;With all due respect, but I doubt that Ms. Riley even considered the possibility of her mutating when she made that will.\u0026rdquo; Harland waved with a paper that showed some test results that confirmed that Erika Riley had indeed mutated in the same way the Prostitute and the Asian had.\n\u0026ldquo;Unfortunately this doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow us to ignore her decision. We have the permission to perform an autopsy from her brother and all we have to do is respect her will.\u0026rdquo; Smith then turned towards James. \u0026ldquo;Thompson, you\u0026rsquo;re going to perform it, get any hint about why she mutated in the first place. Together with Harland\u0026rsquo;s results we might find a pattern. I hope you agree with this, Detective Spencer.\u0026rdquo;\nJacob nodded, \u0026ldquo;I do, but I\u0026rsquo;d like to be involved in this as well. I found her body due to an unrelated case I wanted to question her about, so I might be of help here.\u0026rdquo;\nProfessor Smith just shrugged his shoulders and pointed in James' direction. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not for me to decide - as long as you don\u0026rsquo;t disturb the other scientists here with their work.\u0026rdquo;\nAs expected, James didn\u0026rsquo;t turn him down.\n\u0026ldquo;Why does it have to be so hard?\u0026rdquo; Michelle sighted. For almost an hour now had she tried to avoid her transformation and she had failed every time.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re making progress,\u0026rdquo; Amanda tried to comfort her. The superpowered redhead had assisted her in the training by providing the super energy via skin contact as opposed to the usual drinking of the super potion. Still, whenever Michelle had absorbed enough super energy that she had to store it inside her breasts, her concentration broke and she exploded into her super form immediately.\nThe only good news so far was that their plan had worked and Michelle\u0026rsquo;s costume now stayed intact even when she transformed back to normal. This way she at least kept her decency after blasting off her first outfit.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, I can hold it of a whole second longer than I could an hour ago. And I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I would get any better than that.\u0026rdquo; Michelle pouted, clearly discouraged by her lack of success.\n\u0026ldquo;Some things need time, and one hour isn\u0026rsquo;t really a long time, after all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;With super senses it is,\u0026rdquo; Michelle retorted, before realizing that this didn\u0026rsquo;t really help her case. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just that\u0026hellip; normally I make much quicker progress when I try something related to these powers. This time it just feels like I\u0026rsquo;m doing it wrong, and repetition won\u0026rsquo;t bring any success. Maybe it even is impossible.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or maybe you\u0026rsquo;re just spoiled from your previous success. Since things went rather easy so far, you probably expected some kind of instinct to guide your hand again, right?\u0026rdquo; Amanda answered. \u0026ldquo;But what you are trying to do here goes against these very instincts. I naturally prefer my super form over my normal one, after all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Michelle exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;God you\u0026rsquo;re so right. How could we have missed that part?\u0026rdquo;\nNow Amanda raised her brow indicating she hadn\u0026rsquo;t followed her best friend\u0026rsquo;s trail of thoughts.\n\u0026ldquo;The whole setup for this exercise is wrong!\u0026rdquo; Michelle began explaining. \u0026ldquo;You are sharing some of your super energy, while I am accepting it. In other words a part of me downright says that I want to be super at that moment - at the cost of your resources no less!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t you overdramatizing here? There\u0026rsquo;s still plenty of super energy left in me, not to mention the potion\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle shook her head. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s of no interest for our instincts here. We are supposed to be self-sufficient, remember? You have more super energy than me right now, that\u0026rsquo;s why you can share it with me while my supply is too low to return the favor. While you are consciously doing that to help me train, our instincts see it as me being in a bind and you giving me the necessary power to get back on my feet.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sounds plausible, but why can you prevent your transformation then? From this point of view you should transform right once you have enough energy to do so, but you can fill your body to the max - it\u0026rsquo;s only the breasts where you fail.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because they serve a different purpose than the rest of our bodies. Just look at yourself right now: Each body cell is filled to the max, but the breasts store more power than the rest of your body. In other words they store the excess energy. So once my \u0026lsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; cells are maxed out, my body refuses to simply store away energy before my super cells are filled as well.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda thought about it. \u0026ldquo;Fair enough, but wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that mean that it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to prevent a transformation?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not totally, that\u0026rsquo;s for sure. But right now it would suffice to be able to store some super energy in my breasts without transforming. If I manage to do that, I should be able to stay normal for a day at work while still being able to help if danger calls.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And how do you plan to master that if not the way you tried for the last hour?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let me try something.\u0026rdquo; Michelle folded her legs so she hovered in midair in a lotus position. She slowly descended on the nearby couch and closed her eyes.\nAmanda on her part watched her friend intently - not wanting to disturb her concentration. Thanks to her super eyesight, she could see how her best friend slowly willed her super energy into her breasts - something that Amanda considered unnatural for some reason. After a few seconds, the process already came to a halt and Michelle\u0026rsquo;s face showed more and more strain. Amanda saw that every now and then a bit of super energy would try to get back to her chest before slowly returning to her breasts. It seemed like Michelle was playing tug of war with her breasts, each party wanting to dump the super energy onto the other.\nThe stalemate continued for well over five minutes until suddenly, Michelle\u0026rsquo;s breast began to shrink back down to their original A-cups - which still held the super energy. Then the rest of Michelle\u0026rsquo;s body followed suit, shrinking down to its original form. Just like the previous times, the black leotard shrank accordingly as well.\n\u0026ldquo;Phew, finally managed to do it.\u0026rdquo; Michelle said as she opened her eyes again.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; Amanda was still surprised at her best friends' sudden success. \u0026ldquo;You really willed yourself to transform back, but how?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In a way I simply convinced my body that this is a more practical form right now. While my super form is without a doubt more powerful in every possible aspect, this form has one major advantage: less power consumption. Once I had completely accepted that, transforming back became rather easy.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle began hovering again, first cautious, but soon relieved that it worked the way she intended to.\n\u0026ldquo;So in other words you can now absorb as much super energy as your normal form can handle, but once you get more, you will transform again. Just … how much are you able to store anyway?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s only one way to find out,\u0026rdquo; Michelle held out a glass and poured herself a bit of super potion. \u0026ldquo;Cheers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alright,\u0026rdquo; James exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;We didn\u0026rsquo;t find anything in her stomach, and there was no hint of an injection on her skin either.\u0026rdquo;\nThose had been the first quick tests he had run. James knew about the existence of a super potion, so he had considered this the best possible choices to find a hint. So far he hadn\u0026rsquo;t been able to determine whether the super potion would even leave a trace in her stomach after such a time, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t openly say this.\n\u0026ldquo;There has to be something,\u0026rdquo; Jacob exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;People don\u0026rsquo;t just spontaneously mutate like this!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t get impatient. It\u0026rsquo;ll take time to figure out what changed it, especially since we have no idea how it happened.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It could be sexually transferrable,\u0026rdquo; Jacob suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think so, the man who was almost fucked to death by that Asian is frequently tested to check just that. So far there\u0026rsquo;s no sign of him mutating.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe it only goes one way? So far we only learned about women who mutated this way. What if it was because they had sex with a man of similar powers? You can\u0026rsquo;t rule that out, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You almost sound desperate.\u0026rdquo; James commented. Normally it was Jacob who would be more levelheaded, so it surprised him all the more. Then again this played into his hands as well. Unlike Harland, Jacob seemed convinced that Erika Riley hadn\u0026rsquo;t transformed because of her encounter with Michelle, but through some different means. James knew that this was true, but lacked scientific proof.\nThat was the official side, though. James had figured out that Michelle was more than met the eye through a strand of hair he had analyzed. And while this showed that she had the same kind of mutation as the prostitute or the asian woman, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly the same. Knowing that Michelle\u0026rsquo;s powers had come from a super potion created by a plant, James had concluded that the former two had gotten theirs by a different plant of the same species. And so had Erika whose mutation seemed identical to the other two. Despite this knowledge James had no idea how exactly the mutation occurred. From what he heard from Michelle, he theorized that some kind of virus would cause the mutation by using this \u0026ldquo;super energy\u0026rdquo; she had mentioned. But since he didn\u0026rsquo;t know any details he had no idea whether there would be a hint to find on Erika.\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; Jacob spoke again. \u0026ldquo;She had noticed a man with rather … extreme physique the day before yesterday that had spoken to a paralyzed Asian girl. I was about to ask her about details since I found it suspicious, but she was dead by then.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That sounds indeed suspicious,\u0026rdquo; James confirmed. He still didn\u0026rsquo;t believe in sexual transferability because of that - after all that would leave both partners to be siblings on a genetic level. James tried to avoid this trail of thoughts. He needed more information for a valid theory.\nProf. Christopher Harland was still a bit furious about the fact that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t perform the autopsy on Erika Riley as he continued his autopsy on Jane Doe. If he had to choose, he would\u0026rsquo;ve chosen to perform the autopsy on the former rather than the latter, especially since she had been a patient of his before, no matter how short that lasted. Unfortunately the two hadn\u0026rsquo;t gotten along and she had quickly resigned herself to her fate. Back then, Harland hadn\u0026rsquo;t minded it half as much as now since he hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected her to put such a clause into her will. But the situation with both her and her brother had been even more ironic. It had taken barely more than 24 hours after their little arrangement had fallen apart for him to get attacked by one of these women. Mere hours later Erika had encountered the Angel. Harland had looked into these events closely and came to the conclusion that this was a very unfortunate coincidence.\n\u0026ldquo;Day 3, Wednesday 6 p.m.\u0026rdquo; he spoke into his dictating machine. \u0026ldquo;Subject Jane Doe has been dead for a week now and her d\n\u0026ldquo;So much attention for a dead girl,\u0026rdquo; interrupted a voice.\nHarland turned around to see the origin of that voice: A young woman. With her blonde hair and otherworldly physique he assumed for a moment that this was the Angel that had prevented a plane crash last night. But once he saw her eyes, he knew that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the same woman. Unlike the Angel whose eyes were said to glow blue, this woman had golden eyes. A sense of dread went over him, as he realized how unnatural her eye-color was. And to to confirm his fears, he noticed that she sitting in midair. For some reason he would\u0026rsquo;ve preferred the actual Angel over this random woman appearing in the lab. Harland noticed that her clothes were rather ill-fitting. Yoga pants that ended halfway on her calves and what was supposed to be a baggy T-shirt were the only visible clothes, no shoes or socks and - judging by how her nipples were noticeable through the T-shirt - no bra either.\n\u0026ldquo;Who are you?\u0026rdquo; Harland asked, as his mind raced to put together what he already knew. This woman was obviously another mutant, someone with similar abilities to the Angel, the Redhead and the Asian they had heard of - so far.\nThe woman laughed. \u0026ldquo;Some father you are, not even recognizing your own daughter.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;S-Susan?\u0026rdquo; Harland stammered. Despite all he knew about these superpowered women so far, he hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected his own daughter to join their ranks. Remembering her temper made him doubt that this was a good thing. \u0026ldquo;What happened to you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s just say I got lucky,\u0026rdquo; she giggled as she rose higher in the air. \u0026ldquo;Really lucky.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You could say that,\u0026rdquo; Harlands mind raced. Two women with similar powers ended up dead, now he just hoped that Susan wouldn\u0026rsquo;t join them. \u0026ldquo;But why are you here? Somebody could see you!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So what?\u0026rdquo; Susan countered. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m super-hot and I have super powers, of course I want to show them off!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not here! This is a research facility where everybody tries to look into people like you right now. You have to get out of here!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What? You want to get rid of me again? That\u0026rsquo;s why you hired my last boyfriends too, right? Or sent me down to the botanic lab? Because I was in your way? You know what? Forget that I was here!\u0026rdquo;\nUnbeknownst to her, her eyes had flashed as she said that last part. Susan then made her way to the door, and left the room without making a single noise.\nHer father on the other hand stood there gazing on the space she had occupied during their conversation until she had already closed the doors until eventually wondering why he had interrupted the autopsy.\n\u0026ldquo;Come on, you can do it!\u0026rdquo; Amanda cheered as Michelle was desperately struggling to overcome another dose of super potion. Instead of drinking a normal dose of it, Michelle had settled for shot glasses of mini doses to make it easier to handle the sudden increase in super energy. Both women were aware that this limit was about to be reached, the question was just whether this shot or the next would make Michelle explode into her super form. After all, she had drunk about four normal doses worth of super serum.\nAmanda’s eyes were fixated on Michelle’s chest. By now, each of Michelle’s A-cup breasts contained more than Amanda’s entire body. With her enhanced sight she could clearly see the intensity of the super energy being on the same level as the potion itself right now.\n\u0026ldquo;S-Something’s wrong,\u0026rdquo; Michelle stammered and Amanda soon saw what she meant. The costume around her breasts vanished and exposed her erect nipples to the world. Before she could even wonder what it was about, she saw something leaking out of them: milk. Amanda blinked her exes as if she needed to confirm what happened, but it was obvious. Her best friend was lactating – a bit. And if that wasn’t strange enough, the milk had the signature glow of super energy.\n\u0026ldquo;What the hell?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked once she had gotten herself under control and looked at the two little drops of her own breast milk that had landed on the table.\n\u0026ldquo;Interesting, seems like your body found a way to get rid of excess super energy without causing a transformation,\u0026rdquo; Amanda commented as she carefully touched it. Upon contact, she could feel the super energy entering her body through her fingertips. \u0026ldquo;W-wow. That feels \u0026hellip; strange.\u0026rdquo; Amanda held her head for a second.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;First it felt like it did when I drank the potion, even better actually. But now my knee kinda hurts.\u0026rdquo;\nWithout a second thought Michelle activated her X-ray vision, her eyes turning from their original brown to their super blue as she did so. \u0026ldquo;I don’t see any problem there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see that too, but still it feels like my knee was crushed or something. Maybe some phantom pain from when Erika actually did crush it last night. You know, as payback for when I … Oh my god this is it!\u0026rdquo; Amanda cheerfully exclaimed.\n\u0026ldquo;This is what?\u0026rdquo; Michelle was clearly confused as she was still trying to process the fact that her breast milk contained super serum.\n\u0026ldquo;Your individual power! Just like I could use heat vision and Erika was better with the super clothes, you also had an individual talent. And through absorbing the energy that originates from you, I gained this ability as well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And what does it have to do with your knee hurting? I never experienced that one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But I know someone whose knee should hurt right now: Fred. Ever since you mentioned how you could somehow read your boyfriends’ mind, I secretly hoped that I could use that to figure out what Fred had been hiding from me. I thought it had been a trust problem, but it’s pretty obvious that this is your individual super power. And now that you shared it with me, I can feel what he feels all the way here,\u0026rdquo; Amanda’s expression darkened. \u0026ldquo;I can feel the pain I myself have caused - and a lot more.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, don’t let it get you down again,\u0026rdquo; Michelle hovered over to hug her friend. \u0026ldquo;You did come here in order to find a way to fix not only that, but Fred’s other problems as well, right?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda nodded. \u0026ldquo;You’re right. I’m just a bit overwhelmed that I feel his pain now, that’s all. But you’re bringing up a good point.\u0026rdquo; She then released the hug and grabbed the still half-full bottle with super potion. \u0026ldquo;I should get going and finally start my own research. I want to erase this pain and it won’t be as easy as it was for you to get this transformation bit under control.\u0026rdquo;\nHovering towards the open window, Amanda stopped before leaving. \u0026ldquo;And Michelle?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you for everything.\u0026rdquo;\nWith this, the superpowered redhead took off to the skies with full speed. Unlike other times, Michelle had no trouble following her movements until she was out of sight.\nSusan was furious as she hovered through the halls. There was no real reason for her to stay here, but since her father had wanted her to leave, she left obliged to do the very opposite - it was getting late, so most people should have left the facility already. Even after what happened to her, he dared to cast her aside. In a fit of rage, she slammed her fist into the next wall, only to be caught off-guard, by the crushing noise of said wall. Susan looked at the wall, puzzled because her hand didn’t hurt like she had expected, but even more shocked to see the big hole she had created. The whole superpowers part was still new to her and she hadn’t done anything except flying so far. But now she remembered that she was strong enough to lift a plane – at least that’s what the news about that ‘Angel’ had implied. What had he said after she had suddenly turned into this goddess?\n\u0026ldquo;Have fun!\u0026rdquo;\nYes, that’s what he had said.\n\u0026ldquo;What is going on here?\u0026rdquo; came a familiar voice from behind her, followed by an \u0026ldquo;Oh my god!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;…dess,\u0026rdquo; Susan completed as she turned around towards the newcomer: Deziree Archer, a botanist that had to ‘take care’ of Susan when her father didn’t want her around. Deziree stood there, visibly shocked at the sight. It was no real surprise that the other woman was scared at the sight of Susan. Not after this demonstration of super strength, not to mention the fact that she was still hovering in midair.\n\u0026ldquo;W-who are you?\u0026rdquo; Deziree stammered confirming that Susan wasn\u0026rsquo;t even recognizable as herself. Her formerly black hair had been replaced by a blonde mane, her face - although pretty - was now absolutely divine as was her whole body. Unfortunately this meant she had to improvise on her wardrobe.\n\u0026ldquo;Who indeed?\u0026rdquo; Other than with her father, Susan had no interest in ending the masquerade. She hovered closer to Deziree who still stood there frozen in place. The two woman looked each other in the eyes, and Susan enjoyed Deziree\u0026rsquo;s sheer fear as she listened to her panickingly beating heart. \u0026ldquo;Should you really be standing upright instead of worshipping me?\u0026rdquo; she teased.\n\u0026ldquo;W-what do you mean?\u0026rdquo; Deziree\u0026rsquo;s heart almost skipped a beat.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t act dumb, I\u0026rsquo;m telling you to kiss my feet.\u0026rdquo;\nTo Susan\u0026rsquo;s surprise, she could clearly hear Deziree\u0026rsquo;s heart rate slow down as her look became dreamy. She then kneeled down and placed a kiss on each of Susan\u0026rsquo;s bare feet. Next, Deziree shook her head, looked first at the feet that hovered before her, then followed the legs upwards to meet Susan\u0026rsquo;s gaze again. While fear were slowly reclaiming Deziree\u0026rsquo;s train of thoughts, she also seemed - confused. As if she didn\u0026rsquo;t know how she had gotten to kneel before Susan in the first place. Quickly, however Deziree averted her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;You think that was enough?\u0026rdquo; Susan mocked. \u0026ldquo;Continue!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;With what?\u0026rdquo; Deziree asked as she stood up, still facing away from the blonde superwoman.\n\u0026ldquo;Kissing my feet, obviously!\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree now faced her again, and began to blush. \u0026ldquo;Th-that happened?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I said don\u0026rsquo;t act dumb!\u0026rdquo; Susan then put her legs around Deziree and made a somersault in midair, catapulting the young botanist throught the hallway, screaming.\n\u0026ldquo;What is going on?\u0026rdquo; Jacob asked as the woman\u0026rsquo;s scream reached the lab in which James was performing the autopsy.\nJames on the other hand was just as clueless as the detective, but that scream was obviously not a good sign. But before he could voice this thought, Jacob had already left the lab to look for the source of that scream.\n\u0026ldquo;Please let it be an escaped lab rat,\u0026rdquo; he commented as he followed as well. He knew that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t very likely to cause such a scream.\nA wave of anxiety came over James as they ran through the corridors. What had once been a single scream were now pained moans.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what you get for trying to fool me,\u0026rdquo; a female voice said - and James' anxiety increased exponentially. The next turn revealed the source of the scream: A female scientist - whom James recognized as Deziree Archer - was struggling to get back onto her feet only to get kicked across the hallway and crashing into the wall on the other side.\nThe kick itself sounded a lot worse than the collision with the wall, and James figured that Dezirees ribcage must\u0026rsquo;ve been broken by the force of it. James had no time to verify this theory, as the reason for the other scientists' demise was still hovering in the hallway.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, hands up!\u0026rdquo; Jacob ordered, having already pulled out his gun and aimed it at the woman who had just kicked another woman about thirty feet through the hallway - with no leverage whatsoever. The disturbing part of her was her blonde hair which was close enough to Michelle\u0026rsquo;s to fool most people. Fortunately the golden eyes were a clear sign that this was a different woman.\n\u0026ldquo;And if I refuse?\u0026rdquo; The woman countered. \u0026ldquo;Do you really think this toy in your hands will have any effect on me?\u0026rdquo;\nJacob didn\u0026rsquo;t flinch, though. \u0026ldquo;Do you really think it won\u0026rsquo;t? We\u0026rsquo;ve got a bunch of corpses which say otherwise. This is no comic book, where bullets just bounce off your body.\u0026rdquo;\nTalk about a bluff! Jacob was one of the few people that knew for certain that his gun would have no effect on her. But the golden-eyes goddess did indeed seem a bit intimidated here. Both her and Jacob were engulfed in a staring contest, when suddenly her eyes began to glow.\n\u0026ldquo;Drop that gun!\u0026rdquo;\nTo James' shock, Jacob actually did what he was told.\n\u0026ldquo;My, aren\u0026rsquo;t you a nice guy,\u0026rdquo; the woman started to laugh, rising in the air as she did so. \u0026ldquo;Now come here!\u0026rdquo;\nThis time, James noticed the strange flash in the woman\u0026rsquo;s eyes and immediately felt the urge to comply. As he watched Jacob stumble towards the woman, James figured out what was happening: The woman was mind-controlling them! A part of him wondered if he was supposed to be aware of this, when he suddenly heard Michelle\u0026rsquo;s voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Snap out of it.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he did. After only two steps he stopped - right next to Jacob\u0026rsquo;s dropped gun. Michelle however was nowhere to be seen.\nHe wasted no time and immediately grabbed the gun to point it at the strange woman again. James knew that he was at a clear disadvantage at a staring contest, so he had to hope for the intimidating factor the gun still seemed to possess.\n\u0026ldquo;You point a gun at me, yet you can\u0026rsquo;t look me in the eye,\u0026rdquo; the woman taunted.\nBut James didn\u0026rsquo;t fall for that. Obviously, her eyes were crucial in this mind-control trick so he couldn\u0026rsquo;t risk eye-contact. Unfortunately he was the only one who had been able to fight off said control, and Jacob was still walking towards her. Just a few more steps and he would be in the line of fire. Time was running against him.\nBang!\nJames took the little chance he had and fired the gun as long as the line of fire was still free. Since he knew that the bullet wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do any damage, he put his hopes on the short moment of distraction. After all, according to Michelle she had been very distracted the first time she had gotten hit there.\n\u0026ldquo;Oooh,\u0026rdquo; the woman moaned once the bullet bounced off her chest. \u0026ldquo;Now that\u0026rsquo;s the stuff!\u0026rdquo;\nBefore she could recompose herself, James had fired another round. The first bullet had caused Jacob to stumble, the second broke the control completely and the detective turned around. As he went past James, he reached for the gun only to stop himself halfway. Obviously Jacob had realized that he had been mind-controlled and thus not exactly to be trusted with a gun right now.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes!\u0026rdquo; the woman now directly pointed her chest in James direction - downright urging him to fire again.\nJames gladly complied. With a nod, Jacob went past him to pick up the still struggling Dr. Archer. Come to think of it, this could be a futile gesture. Once this woman grew tired of being shot at - best case scenario would be for him to run out of bullets - she would have absolutely no problem with catching up to them. The only hope would be for her to not be that interested in further torturing Dr. Archer once she was out of sight. Which was only possible if this women didn\u0026rsquo;t use X-ray vision. As for James himself, things were looking grimmer each time he pulled the trigger. Running would not be an option since she was hovering towards him - whether this was consciously or not he couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you really think we should leave him alone there?\u0026rdquo; Deziree asked as they ran through the corridor.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not like we have that many options,\u0026rdquo; answered Jacob. \u0026ldquo;And if you ask me we better get out of here as soon as possible!\u0026rdquo;\nThis was easier said than done. Deziree wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly the athletic type so running was far from her strong suit. And to make matters worse she was trying to do so wearing heels. For the important meeting this morning she had dressed up and used them to make up for her lack of height. Considering she normally preferred flats, trying to run in heels proved to be a mistake.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah!\u0026rdquo;\nHaving misplaced her step, Deziree\u0026rsquo;s right foot broke away under her as she fell to the ground. The pain shooting through it left her little doubt that she had sprained her ankle in the process.\n\u0026ldquo;Hold on!\u0026rdquo;\nJacob didn\u0026rsquo;t waste much time asking if she was alright, but simply picked her up to carry her the remaining distance to the elevator. Once inside, he put her down and was about to set the elevator to bring them towards the first floor.\n\u0026ldquo;We gotta go to the second basement floor,\u0026rdquo; she announced, holding out her key card to imply that it was needed to reach this level.\n\u0026ldquo;What? The basement isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a good place to flee to!\u0026rdquo; Jacob exclaimed, but only half-heartedly. He looked at her more curious than surprised.\nDeziree tried to hold his gaze, but eventually shied away, blushing. \u0026ldquo;My lab is down there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And?\u0026rdquo; Jacob said. \u0026ldquo;Does it have anything to do with that woman up there that attacked you?\u0026rdquo;\nBiting her lip, Deziree pondered her next statement.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I don\u0026rsquo;t know for sure, but I have a theory … and it might help us out if I\u0026rsquo;m right.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Shoot it!\u0026rdquo;\nFor almost two minutes, James fired bullet after bullet onto the mysterious woman, each of them causing her to moan in delight and buying him a few more seconds before he had to fire the next one. He was actually surprised that this distraction worked this well, considering that Michelle had been distracted by a bullet once and never again. The situation was bizarre enough as it was.\nDespite him taking as much time between shots as possible, eventually the loud bang of the gun was replaced by a click that meant that James was out of bullets.\n\u0026ldquo;Over already?\u0026rdquo; The woman seemed even more disappointed about this than James was. Her lips curled into a wicked smile and James didn\u0026rsquo;t need to guess that her eyes were still fixed on him. He still needed to avoid eye-contact after all, and the fact that the bullets had turned her shirt into Swiss cheese in the chest area made it awfully easy to do so. Could it get even more ironic? He had been dating Michelle for two days now and was already actively trying to avoid eye contact with another woman by staring at said woman\u0026rsquo;s breasts. Not to mention that he had deliberately turned her on. And now he was running out of options.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t beat yourself up because of that\u0026rdquo;, he heard Michelle\u0026rsquo;s voice in the back of his head.\nWas he starting to hallucinate now? Earlier when he had broken out of the mind control, he had heard her voice too. But this time it felt stronger, almost like the time Michelle had shown him the past event\u0026rsquo;s through her very own memories.\n\u0026ldquo;Why are you stepping away from me?\u0026rdquo; The woman asked seductively. Still James could hear a hint of annoyance in her voice. \u0026ldquo;You turn me on and then you run away? How impolite. And you\u0026rsquo;re staring at my tits to boot.\u0026rdquo;\nJames continued to step backwards while the woman floated closer to him.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m actually trying to … uhm \u0026hellip; assess the damage done to your body,\u0026rdquo; he bluffed.\n\u0026ldquo;Why do I find it hard to believe?\u0026rdquo;\nJames was really running out of arguments now. As if on cue he reached the wall. Instead of taking a turn he had trapped himself. The woman was so close, he could smell her already. Didn\u0026rsquo;t help that her scent was similar to Michelle\u0026rsquo;s. Probably the same kind of super pheromones, which means I\u0026rsquo;m screwed. \u0026ldquo;You see, I have a girlfriend\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think I care?\u0026rdquo; She picked him up by the collar, and as he still struggled to avoid eye contact, she held his chin in place with her remaining hand. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going to finish what you started and you won\u0026rsquo;t care about your girlfriend while we\u0026rsquo;re at it. If you\u0026rsquo;re good, I might let you live and you can tell her about how you were with a woman that outmatches her in every possible aspect.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m not so sure about that.\u0026rdquo; James struggled to say that. Her pheromones and her hypnotic eyes were eating away his reasoning. It was a downright miracle she hadn\u0026rsquo;t turned him into a mindless slave yet. Still, as much as her attempts had grown, so had his resistance.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh? Are you calling me a liar?\u0026rdquo; The woman snarked. \u0026ldquo;I really do consider letting you live, but if you struggle like that, the chances are decreasing! What would your precious litte girlfriend say if you wasted your life like this?\u0026rdquo;\nBefore James could even think of an answer the wall next to them exploded. All he could see was an arm grabbing the woman before him before the next wall exploded with both her and the newcomer disappearing. And even though he had not been able to see more than a blur here, he clearly felt who the newcomer was.\nJacob stared through the thick security glass to watch the strange plant behind it.\n\u0026ldquo;So you\u0026rsquo;re saying that this thing might be the reason behind the mutations?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not this one specifically,\u0026rdquo; Deziree explained. \u0026ldquo;But one or more plants just like that. It\u0026rsquo;s DNA consists of 54 chromosomes which is exactly the amount of extra chromosomes found in the mutated women.\u0026rdquo;\nAs she spoke, her hands were working on the console, and after a few seconds the plant disappeared behind a thick steel plate.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, the plant is sealed,\u0026rdquo; she tried to sound as confident as possible. \u0026ldquo;Although I doubt it will slow down someone as strong as her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sealing it will at least hide the plant,\u0026rdquo; Jacob commented.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, but with our luck she also has X-ray vision or something like that to spot it anyway.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s nothing more that we could do to prevent that if that were the case. So there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to feel down because of it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry, today hasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly been my day,\u0026rdquo; Deziree sheepishly admitted. \u0026ldquo;We … uhm, gotta seal of something else too.\u0026rdquo;\nShe noted at another console and Jacob took the hint as he helped her to reach it - thanks to her twisted ankle she had trouble walking, after all.\n\u0026ldquo;You mean those containers? What exactly is in there?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Some liquid that the plant was producing. In my theory it would be what causes the mutations.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And judging by that Asian’s victim the mutations include super powers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That’s the current theory. But as I said, my analysis wasn\u0026rsquo;t even close to indicate this liquid is the actual catalyst. It’s just the only part of the plant that can be consumed in one way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just to see that I got this right: this container contains possibly superpower-granting stuff.\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree bit her lips again. \u0026ldquo;You think about using the stuff instead of sealing it away, right?\u0026rdquo;\nAfter a few layers of concrete Michelle dropped the other woman into a large storage room. Her pulse raced. Thanks to her mental bond with James, she had immediately known about his predicament. The first thing she did was to drink a large dose of super serum, which meant that her body now buzzed with more power than ever. That wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only reason why her pulse raced. This was her first fight with another superhuman person, a whole different league than the criminals she had dealt before. But most importantly: this woman had dared to threaten her boyfriend.\nMichelle eyed her enemy. The woman looked much more like her than she liked to admit. The differences in their physique were minimal, probably unnoticeable by any normal human. Their hair however had the exact same color, which didn\u0026rsquo;t really surprise Michelle since she knew that the hair was completely affected by the super energy coursing through them. Speaking of which, Michelle was glad to notice that the other woman had only a good dose worth of super energy left, about a quarter of what Michelle sported right now.\nThe only difference visible for normal humans however were the eyes. Where Michelle\u0026rsquo;s were blue and despite their glow could pass on as a normal human being, her counterpart had golden orbs that made it really clear that this was no ordinary woman.\n\u0026ldquo;Now look at that, you ruined my outfit!\u0026rdquo; the other blonde complained as she assessed the damage. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t kidding as unlike her body, her clothes weren\u0026rsquo;t meant to be thrown through several layers of concrete. Now her shirt was barely more than rags while Michelle\u0026rsquo;s own costume wasn\u0026rsquo;t even dirty. \u0026ldquo;What? No apology?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did you really expect any?\u0026rdquo; Michelle countered. \u0026ldquo;A few seconds ago you deliberately let yourself get shot and now you complain about clothing damage?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe I should ruin your clothes then, seems only fair after you attacked me out of the blue.\u0026rdquo;\nThe other woman jumped at her, but Michelle had already activated her super senses. With her perception increased, the quick attack now happened in slow motion, allowing her to easily dodge it.\nA punch followed next, but Michelle\u0026rsquo;s movements were just as quick as her reaction.\nAngry, the other blonde tried to kick Michelle, who gladly grabbed her foot mid-kick and threw her attacker into a shelf and the wall behind it. The shelf and anything on it was destroyed on impact and the wall itself suffered too, but as expected the blonde stranger got back up immediately.\nBy now, Michelle\u0026rsquo;s speed advantage became obvious. Her activated super senses came with the added benefit that her body also reacted quicker to her commands.\nThe other blonde didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to bother too much as she took her time checking her body for wounds that weren\u0026rsquo;t there. This woman was clearly new to these powers.\n\u0026ldquo;How about you give up and tell me how you got these powers?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked.\n\u0026ldquo;As if!\u0026rdquo; the other woman flew into her direction again, launching another ray of punches of which none hit their intended target. Each missing punch only served to increase the womans anger however.\n\u0026ldquo;Hold still!\u0026rdquo; she shouted and her eyes flashed with a golden burst of super energy.\nThanks to her mental connection with James, Michelle already knew what this meant. This woman had some mind-controlling powers that she was now trying to use subconsciously. The same mental connection had allowed her to break this control on James from afar and naturally, Michelle herself was in no danger of being affected.\nAnother swing, and again Michelle had little trouble dodging it. As she ducked under the attack, Michelle decided to go on the offense again. She clenched her fist, her whole right arm building up power before she slammed it into her opponents belly with full force.\nBoom.\nA millisecond later Michelle was alone in the room. Her arm was still stretched out, and she noticed that it had grown in definition right before the punch as it was now shrinking down to it\u0026rsquo;s previous size. Her opponent however had been punched through several walls again.\n\u0026ldquo;Number three sealed,\u0026rdquo; Deziree commented again as the container vanished into the underground vault. Now there was only one container left and the decision about whether to seal it or take the chance that it would grant them super powers.\nJacob held the last container in his hand and it was clear that he was still pondering about what to do with it as well. If they drank it, they would most likely be able to hold their own against the blonde stranger, but there were at least two corpses that told a different story.\nSuddenly there were a series of loud booms that shoot the building, each one getting closer to their position until finally, the wall exploded as their blonde attacker fell through it to land on the floor, sliding over it before finally coming to a stop.\nDeziree\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened in shock. For a second she was convinced that this woman had searched and found them. But then she noticed that her entrance didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have been voluntary. The woman was about to get up and Deziree gulped as she realized that her clothes were all but destroyed. Her yoga pants were ragged and cut - while the legs they covered didn\u0026rsquo;t so much as show a scratch. As for the baggy T-shirt she had been wearing - that was nowhere to be seen. A wave of jealousy overcame Deziree as she watched the other woman\u0026rsquo;s naked upper body. The slender waist, hard cut abs and then the enormous breasts - compared to the incredible powers this just seemed unfair to Deziree.\nStill, kneeling on the floor, the woman lifted her hand and slammed it into the ground.\n\u0026ldquo;DAMMIT!\u0026rdquo; she cursed, as her fist shattered the floor. The force of her punch caused the ground to shake which - combined with her sprained ankle - made it impossible for Deziree to keep her balance and she fell to the ground.\nThe woman then looked around, spotting Jacob who had managed to keep his balance there. Deziree however was mostly hidden behind the table.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my, you again,\u0026rdquo; she commented. Her voice had suddenly turned sweet and flirty again, a stark contrast to the curse she had spewed in her outburst. She began to walk into his direction, but after a few steps she became airborne with a wicked smile upon her face. \u0026ldquo;Like what you see?\u0026rdquo; she said as she basically stuck out her oversized breasts in Jacobs direction. \u0026ldquo;Now come to me!\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree didn\u0026rsquo;t need to see it to know that this woman was once again using her mind control powers on him. And to her horror, Jacob began walking towards her - the container with the plant liquid still in hand.\n\u0026ldquo;What are you carrying there?\u0026rdquo;\nJacob didn\u0026rsquo;t answer as he walked towards her.\n\u0026ldquo;Answer me!\u0026rdquo; she added annoyed.\n\u0026ldquo;The liquid extracted from an alien plant, which seems to be the source of super powers just as yours.\u0026rdquo; Jacob said in a flat, robotic manner.\nThe woman\u0026rsquo;s golden eyes widened as she heard that. \u0026ldquo;Give it to me!\u0026rdquo;\nJacob complied.\nBehind her table, Deziree watched in horror, as the blonde woman opened the container, peeked inside and spouted a manic grin. \u0026ldquo;Oh yeah, I know that glow!\u0026rdquo; she said before putting it towards her mouth. The container was big enough to hold three liters of liquid and was made of solid steel - heavy enough for Deziree to have problems when dealing with it. This woman however used it as if it was just a small bottle as she began to drink it\u0026rsquo;s contents.\nFor several seconds, the only sound that was to be heard were her gulping noises. And even though this was the worst thing that could happen, Deziree looked at the scene with curiosity.\nThe woman hovered a bit higher, but otherwise nothing seemed to happen. Then suddenly, the blonde woman dropped the container, clutching her chest as she released a slight moan. All over her body she seemed to gain even more definition, her arms and legs growing in size and the latter tore the remainder of her pants apart. Then the process reversed itself, as her body began to emit a slight bluish glow.\n\u0026ldquo;Too much,\u0026rdquo; she panted as she grabbed her breasts firmly, her legs kicking aimlessly through the air. Unfortunately Jacob still seemed to be dazed by her mind control as he didn\u0026rsquo;t even try to dodge as one accidental kick sent him flying across the room to collapse against the wall, passing out.\nDeziree could see that the other woman\u0026rsquo;s nipples were getting erect and with another firm grip began to leak milk that began to drip on the ground. \u0026ldquo;Why on earth is she starting to lactate now?\u0026rdquo; she thought to herself.\nA few seconds later, the flow of milk had subsided already, though the puddle on the floor was noticeable. As for the woman, she let out a sigh of release as she straightened herself up in midair. The glow on her body faded away as well.\n\u0026ldquo;Much better,\u0026rdquo; she commented as she flexed her arms who suddenly grew in size again. \u0026ldquo;Yup, I am at the absolute peak of what my body can handle. Now that \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; bitch won\u0026rsquo;t stand a chance.\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree gasped as she heard that. The \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; was here? She barely had time to finish that thought as her gasp hadn\u0026rsquo;t gone unnoticed. The woman turned towards her, slowly hovering into her direction.\n\u0026ldquo;Now look at that, little Deziree hides under the table!\u0026rdquo;\nShe couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe her ears. \u0026ldquo;W-who are you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh right, I don\u0026rsquo;t look like before, don\u0026rsquo;t I? It\u0026rsquo;s Susan.\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree desperately tried to get away, but with her movement limited to crawling, her chances were slim.\nThe woman picked up the table with one hand and looked at her with a crazed smile.\n\u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;re crawling like a cockroach, I should smash you like one.\u0026rdquo;\nWith that she used the table as an oversized club and swung it at her.\nDeziree\u0026rsquo;s life flashed in front of her eyes.\nAnd one moment later she stared into the glowing blue eyes of another goddess. She didn\u0026rsquo;t even have time to get lost in the sudden closeness with the newly arrived woman as Susan hit her with the table in the back. The metallic table screamed as it contorted against the woman\u0026rsquo;s body. Deziree wasn\u0026rsquo;t surprised that her savior was utterly unimpressed by that.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you alright?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\nSomething about her calmed Deziree down, comforted her. She nodded and didn\u0026rsquo;t object as the woman picked her up and … the next moment she heard another slam shaking the building from the other side of the room. Looking at the source, she was surprised to see that \u0026ldquo;the other side of the room\u0026rdquo; was where she had been lying just a second ago - Susan had donned the distorted table and tried to punch both her and the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; protecting her.\nHer thoughts raced, even if the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; was able to dodge Susan\u0026rsquo;s punch, how could she carry Deziree to safety as well? Her body shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to withstand the forces at play here.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026hellip; how?\u0026rdquo; she began.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry,\u0026rdquo; said the woman as she put her down.\nMichelle used her X-ray vision to check the woman she had just saved for injuries, and found her ankle to be twisted. Naturally she wanted to fix the injury - or at least help with the injury, but\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey!\u0026rdquo; the other blonde shouted. \u0026ldquo;Are you just going to ignore me?\u0026rdquo;\nTurning around, Michelle confirmed what the quick glances earlier had suggested. This woman had somehow gotten her hands on a huge amount of super energy as her body was filled to the brim with it. If she wanted to win this one, she needed a plan - and a good one. Either get her hands on some more super energy or have her enemy burn through her amount. In a close up fight, Michelle had already proven that she had an advantage, something that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t change by the other having more energy at her disposal. Still, having to protect others would be a huge disadvantage in the long run.\nMichelle charged her enemy, crossing the distance quickly by combining her initial jump with her flight powers. Thanks to her senses working in overdrive, she saw her enemy preparing a counterattack based on Michelle\u0026rsquo;s attack path. Of course she couldn\u0026rsquo;t have that. Right before the other blonde\u0026rsquo;s fist would hit her face, Michelle dodged with the help of her flight powers.\nThe woman\u0026rsquo;s punched the air and struggled to keep her balance. Michelle used the opportunity to touch down on the floor and use the leverage to give extra force to he kick that sent her enemy flying through the same series of walls that had brought her here.\nNow time was of essence. Michelle had already wasted precious time when she had kicked Susan here and couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford to do so again. She rushed over to the woman, and tended to her twisted ankle. Quickly she moved the lower part of the woman\u0026rsquo;s stockings and concentrated on creating a bandage around her ankle. The bandage pulled itself tight, yet Michelle knew that it was only a small help here. Her previous sharing her invulnerability had done more for that woman. As she thought about that, Michelle found that she could enhance her newly created bandage a bit. Willing a small amount of her super energy into it, she caused it to leak some of it as invulnerability into the woman. The amount was small enough, that it was barely more than a painkiller.\n\u0026ldquo;That should help you to get out of here,\u0026rdquo; Michelle concluded, before following her opponent through the hole in the wall. The first time she had taken her time trying to follow her with X-ray vision, only to find that it was impaired by the thick walls. Those were thick enough to qualify for a bunker and probably contained lead.\nSusan finally got to a stop again, after crashing through several of these thick walls. She had always wondered why the basement was so high security, but now it was downright annoying to be punched through the thick walls. No, more than that it truly stung. Ever since gaining these powers she hadn\u0026rsquo;t felt pain, but this \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; had taught her otherwise. This woman had some nasty punches that ironically managed to hurt her. But when Susan looked at the part of her body that had hurt, there was no wound - not anymore. It felt to her like the damage was dealt, but healed immediately as opposed to the bullets that hadn\u0026rsquo;t penetrated her skin in the slightest.\nTo Susan this simply meant that one super could hurt another and that her added powers didn\u0026rsquo;t make her immune to that either. The problem was that despite her efforts and quick reaction, the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; moved so much quicker than her, that she seemed impossible to hit. Looking back through the hole she had come through, she didn\u0026rsquo;t see the other blonde.\n\u0026ldquo;Probably she\u0026rsquo;s taking her time again,\u0026rdquo; Susan thought, still eyeing the hole.\nSeconds passed but there was no sight of her. Susan was perfectly able to see back into the lab from which she had been punched here, but there was no sign of the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo;. Then it hit her: she was back where their first brawl had started, so there where two series' of holes that connected the two rooms.\nUnfortunately this was when the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; hit her as well. A slight kick to the legs made Susan struggle for balance and instinctively begin to hover. Before she knew it she was hovering horizontally and utterly defenseless as the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo;s punched her into the stomach again. This time her involuntary flight through the buildings walls wasn\u0026rsquo;t horizontally, but vertically passing several levels before shooting through the roof.\nJust as she had regained her bearing, the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; had caught up to her already. This time however she stopped hovering several feet from her.\n\u0026ldquo;Have enough?\u0026rdquo; she asked with a serious tone.\n\u0026ldquo;Never!\u0026rdquo; Susan spat back, although she was getting desperate. This woman had caused quite a bit of damage while she herself hadn\u0026rsquo;t landed a single hit yet.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, have it your way!\u0026rdquo;\nThe \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; launched another attack, and Susan\u0026rsquo;s braced herself from the hit that was sure to happen by flexing her muscles. For the first time she noticed how her muscle mass increased through that as she quickly took on the proportions fitting for a female bodybuilder.\nBoom.\nThe punch hit, causing Susan to shoot through the late afternoon sky. But that was all there was to it. No pain this time. Susan smiled. It was just logical that flexing her abs in defense countered the punch and thus avoided damage. And without damage, she felt that the energy she had lost was a lot less than before. Another look at her enemy and Susan smiled even further. She was beginning to figure out how much energy it took for the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; to land a punch - and it was about roughly the same amount Susan had lost receiving it. In short it made no difference whethe she was the one giving or receiving the punches, the winner would be the one who lasted longer. And thanks to her refilling on the potion earlier, Susan had the advantage here.\nApparently the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; had reached the same conclusion. While she did catch up to Susan, she also kept a certain distance, watching the golden-eyed blonde as if to determine a new strategy. Eventually she spoke up.\n\u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t you going to change into something less\u0026hellip; revealing?\u0026rdquo;\nFeeling the air on her bare skin, Susan was once again reminded that she was naked. Her clothes hadn\u0026rsquo;t withstood the fight at all. The \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; however didn\u0026rsquo;t have that problem. \u0026ldquo;What do you mean with that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m tired of fighting a naked woman, that\u0026rsquo;s all. Especially when that women only needs to will some clothes into existence.\u0026rdquo;\nNow that was odd. Susan took a further look at the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo;s getup. Her black leotard seemed to be as good as new - albeit dirty now. And the ballerinas - considering the forces at play, these shoes should have flown off her feet long ago. How come they still stuck to them? And why didn\u0026rsquo;t the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; wear boots instead, unlike her she seems to have been super long enough to buy herself a pair. Susan figured that this was a trap.\n\u0026ldquo;Ah yeah, and while I\u0026rsquo;m at it you\u0026rsquo;re going to sucker punch me. How stupid do you think I am?\u0026rdquo;\nThe \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; sighed, hovering backwards slowly to increase the distance between them. \u0026ldquo;Say stop if I\u0026rsquo;m far enough away. Or come at me in case you simply can\u0026rsquo;t do it. I could only do something plain like this, after all.\u0026rdquo;\nSusan wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced yet. There had to be a catch to this sudden friendliness. When it came to flying, Susan would consider herself quite good already, but this woman outshined her there as well. There was no telling how quickly she would be able to cross the distance, after all.\nDeciding to keep her guard up, Susan tried to will some clothes into existence while still being on the fence. Quickly she felt some fabric appear on her skin, but at the same time became aware of the problem here: Creating clothes was quite energy-consuming.\n\u0026ldquo;Trying to get me waste my powers on creating clothes, are we?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well it was worth hoping you\u0026rsquo;d go over the top and go for something flashy, but you\u0026rsquo;re not much more creative than I am, right Susan?\u0026rdquo;\nHearing her own name surprised her, but then Susan remembered that she had imagined clothes that were basically a copy of the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo;s leotard, except with \u0026ldquo;Super Susan\u0026rdquo; written on the chest. Still, curiosity got the better of her and she looked down to verify that she was indeed wearing the leotard she had imagined. Truth be told, she was looking forward to trying herself on some more complex clothes, but first she needed to take care of this wannabe-superheroine here.\nSusan looked up again. She had used precious seconds to stare her clothes that her enemy could have used to initiate an attack. If fact, Susan had fully expected her too and thus never lowered her defense. But the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; was still locked in place, hovering above the skyline, arms crossed and with a confident smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Since I was so kind to tell you my name, how about you tell me yours?\u0026rdquo; Susan teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Apparently everybody calls me \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo;. Not that I chose that name, but to be honest I can\u0026rsquo;t think of anything better. And believe me, I tried. In the end I just decided to go with whatever the press throws at me.\u0026rdquo; The \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; sounded awfully calm as she explained it.\n\u0026ldquo;I know how the press calls you, but I want your real name!\u0026rdquo; Susan was getting irritated. Something about this situation creeped her out. This woman had attacked her out of nowhere, relentlessly making one hit after another, yet here she was playing it cool and having a chat? Was she trying to find a strategy or did she attempt to provoke an attack by Susan that she could easily counter?\n\u0026ldquo;My real name? I don\u0026rsquo;t think I want that to become public knowledge. You see, once I\u0026rsquo;ve kicked your ass you will spend a long time with the police and I can imagine they want to know my name as well. But if you REALLY want to know, then I might reconsider if you tell me how you got your hands on these powers.\u0026rdquo;\nSusan began to laugh. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got to be kidding me! Kicking my ass? I\u0026rsquo;ve got twice as much of this energy inside me than you have.\u0026rdquo; She showed off her oversized biceps. \u0026ldquo;And I am strong enough to shrug off anything you throw at me!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I can see that.\u0026rdquo; The \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; was just as calm and collected as before.\nHow could this woman still be so confident in winning? Susan became anxious again. She had found a way to counter anything that woman had thrown at her so far, so what was she missing? As long as she kept her muscles flexed, she was save, wasn\u0026rsquo;t she?\nSusan\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened as she realized what was wrong. Keeping her muscles in their oversized form was a valid defense, but it did come with a prize. She was using up a lot of super energy just to keep them in this state.\n\u0026ldquo;You were stalling me the entire time!\u0026rdquo; Susan angrily concluded.\n\u0026ldquo;When we got up here, you had three times as much energy than I had. Actually I am surprised that you noticed the high energy consumption of creating clothes but failed to see the constant flexing you\u0026rsquo;re doing there burning up your stamina. You must be pretty dense.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah!\u0026rdquo; Susan cried out as she charged the other woman. She knew that this was basically the only course of action she had left. This woman had totally and utterly fooled her, but she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t let her rage blind her. Attacking her and landing a hit was her only chance to win. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t let her guard down as this would allow her enemy to punch her around again, but she couldn\u0026rsquo;t play for time either. Pretending to be blind with rage was the only strategy she could come up with and hope that the other woman would underestimate her.\nOff course, the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; dodged her attacks with ease. Susan knew that this would happen and kept punching and kicking the air, trying to read her opponents movements, to predict her next dodge. Eventually, she found an opening that she used to slam her fist right into the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo;s abdomen.\nBoom.\nThat sound was music to Susan\u0026rsquo;s ears. Finally she had landed a hit and the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; was the one experiencing the uncontrolled flight through the air.\nBut that didn\u0026rsquo;t happen. With horror, Susan realized that her punch had dealt zero damage and quickly understood why: The \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; had used the very same trick she had and flexed her abs right before the punch. On top of that however, she had kept herself in position instead of flying aimlessly through the sky. It took Susan a second to realize that she had anchored herself with some expert use of her flight powers. Through the corner of her eye she saw the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo;s fist approaching and for a split second the world turned black.\nThe initial punch to the face broke Susan\u0026rsquo;s concentration and with it her defense. As she stopped flexing, her muscles shrank back in size and before she could do something about it, another punch or kick would hit her, propelling her over the sky. This repeated several timed. The pain from one punch would barely subside before another would hit her. Despite punching her all over the sky, the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; seemed to have no problem catching up her and deliver another punch.\nFor several minutes that felt like eternity, Susan was trapped in a world of pain until finally, instead of delivering another kick, the Angel grabbed her by the throat, and held her up high.\n\u0026ldquo;Ready to give up now?\u0026rdquo; she asked again.\nSusan felt a strange, dragging sensation from where the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; grabbed her throat. She noticed that the woman was trying to suck out the super energy from her and once she realized that, she managed to interrupt that process.\n\u0026ldquo;This can go two ways: You either cease your struggling, I depower you and hand you over to the police. Or I could continue beating you up until you are out of power - and I can\u0026rsquo;t promise that you\u0026rsquo;d survive that.\u0026rdquo;\nPanic set in and Susan instinctively shielded herself even more from the other woman\u0026rsquo;s attempt to suck the super energy out of her. After a few seconds, though she calmed down enough to actually consider her alternatives.\nMichelle watched Susan intently as the latter tried to come to a conclusion. She was a bit surprised at how superior she had turned out to be, but right now she needed to stay focused on the task at hand. Even though she had found it was technical possible to suck out the super energy from her enemy, the latter\u0026rsquo;s instincts foiled these plans almost immediately. This was no true surprise, though. If she wanted to depower Susan without risking to kill her, she would need her cooperation.\nSusan let out a sigh and immediately, Michelle could feel the latter\u0026rsquo;s power flow into her. She loosened her grip on the other woman\u0026rsquo;s throat to avoid crushing it the moment Susan would be depowered. The power transfusion took a bit longer than Michelle had expected as Susan was still reluctant on giving up her powers. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t blame her and short while later, Michelle felt the other woman begin to shake and shiver in her grasp.\n\u0026ldquo;C-c-c-cold,\u0026rdquo; was all the other woman managed to say and Michelle realized that their fight had brought them to the upper atmosphere where warms and oxygen were rather sparse. Quickly, she began to descend, not wanting to risk giving Susan a bit of energy to cope with this, Michelle took the other woman into a warming embrace instead.\nThe real strange thing however was Susan\u0026rsquo;s appearance. Despite having no super energy in here body anymore, she didn\u0026rsquo;t revert to however she looked originally. This concerned Michelle. After all, she had just absorbed Susan\u0026rsquo;s super energy and with it any powers that were exclusive to her. She knew about Susan having some kind of mind-control powers that she was positive were now her own as well - for all it was worth. If her lack of transforming back was in any way related to such a power, then she herself would be stuck in her super form as well. She tried not to overthink it too much, as she would now have to leave Susan with the police and needed to think about what to say.\n\u0026ldquo;Did someone get the number of that truck?\u0026rdquo; Jacob exclaimed as he regained consciousness. Even though he meant it as a joke, he surely felt like he had been struck by a truck\n\u0026ldquo;Actually the driver introduced herself,\u0026rdquo; Deziree joked back as she pulled back the bandage she had been using on his arm. It didn\u0026rsquo;t exactly feel like a deep wound, but Jacob appreciated the first aid he was receiving.\n\u0026ldquo;What happened? I remember us sealing this liquid, then the blonde devil appear here, but after that things get fuzzy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She mind-controlled you in giving her the liquid which seemed to power her up. You got hit by accident and lost consciousness. You\u0026rsquo;re lucky that you weren\u0026rsquo;t seriously injured.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Considering how this day went, my luck had to kick in at one point.\u0026rdquo; He looked at Deziree. \u0026ldquo;Sorry, I think during all the trouble I forgot to introduce myself: Jacob Spencer.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Deziree Archer,\u0026rdquo; she answered before shyly averting her eyes. \u0026ldquo;You can call me Deziree.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you, Deziree,\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For what?\u0026rdquo; she blushed\nJacob pointed at the bandage on his arm. \u0026ldquo;For patching me up, for example. Considering how weird the situation was, it takes a lot to keep calm enough to do that.\u0026rdquo; He then took notice of her also bandaged leg. \u0026ldquo;How\u0026rsquo;s your ankle doing?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh that? I\u0026rsquo;m fine for some reason. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit hard to explain, the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; showed up, and magically created the bandage and then she disappeared to take care of Susan.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo;? You mean the real deal not the blonde psychopath? And who is Susan.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Susan is the blonde psychopath. She introduced herself before … she tried to kill me.\u0026rdquo; Deziree shuddered at the thought, tears forming in her eyes. \u0026ldquo;If not for the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo;s appearance, I would be dead by now\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nJacob leaned over to hug the young scientist. He knew that today\u0026rsquo;s events would be quite traumatic for her, and was relieved that she returned the hug. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s ok,\u0026rdquo; he whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahem\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; another voice broke the silence, as James entered the scene.\nDeziree reacted by releasing the hug immediately.\n\u0026ldquo;D-Dr. Thompson, g-good to see you,\u0026rdquo; she stammered, obviously too embarrassed.\n\u0026ldquo;How did you manage to escape that blonde psycho?\u0026rdquo; Jacob asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Divine intervention,\u0026rdquo; James began before explaining what happened after they had been separated. \u0026ldquo;… Just when I thought I was totally screwed, the walls exploded and she was gone, probably facing off against someone her own size. And judging by the destruction here, it seems like you saw part of the show as well. But why were you here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We tried to seal off some kind of plant that Deziree here thought responsible for the appearance of these superpowered women. And apparently her theory was right.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; yeah,\u0026rdquo; Deziree blushed, adjusting her glasses before she tried to explain. \u0026ldquo;I noticed that the added chromosomes on the mutated women were the same number as the chromosomes this plant possessed which could mean that the women were more or less human-plant hybrids.\u0026rdquo;\nJames\u0026rsquo; eyes widened. \u0026ldquo;Where exactly did this plant come from?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm, we found the seeds for it inside the meteor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And when exactly did you intent to mention that? I\u0026rsquo;m on field duty looking for stuff like this and nobody mentioned that the meteor actually contained an alien life form!\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree was visibly intimidated by that as she backed away from him a bit.\n\u0026ldquo;Yo Thompson,\u0026rdquo; Jacob interfered. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not her fault that your higher-ups keep you in the grey, so don\u0026rsquo;t get mad at her for that. In fact, Deziree\u0026rsquo;s quick decision may have prevented worse from happening.\u0026rdquo;\nBoth James and Deziree looked at him surprised, but James eventually nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry for that outburst. It\u0026rsquo;s true that I\u0026rsquo;m a bit frustrated to be kept out of the loop with something big as that.\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree nodded as well. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s alright, I know that feeling. After all, I didn\u0026rsquo;t learn about this \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; until this morning when she dominated the news. Had to try and put a lot of pieces together since then.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to see what else you figured out on that plant.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually not that much,\u0026rdquo; Deziree explained. \u0026ldquo;The thing produces a strange liquid that apparently is responsible for these superhumans, but other than that there\u0026rsquo;s not much to say. I can give you a filed report tomorrow if you want.\u0026rdquo;\nJames nodded. \u0026ldquo;That would suffice, I still have to finish an autopsy after all and once I\u0026rsquo;m done it would be good to compare the results.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So Deziree, I know that this isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a comfortable question, but do you have any idea why this Susan was out to kill you?\u0026rdquo; Jacob asked.\nDeziree shook her head. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t say I liked her to begin with, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t give her any specific reason to hate me, either. If you ask me she\u0026rsquo;s just pissed off at the world after the recent break-up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Break-up?\u0026rdquo; Jacob repeated. \u0026ldquo;From whom?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm, if I understood it correctly it was the guy who was attacked by the redhead, I think his name was Riley or something. At least he was one of the guys attacked.\u0026rdquo;\nNow that was one interesting piece of information. \u0026ldquo;Fred Riley, whose sister\u0026rsquo;s corpse we have lying up in the lab for an autopsy\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Jacob thought aloud. \u0026ldquo;this can\u0026rsquo;t be a coincidence.\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened as she heard about the connection.\n\u0026ldquo;Detective Spencer?\u0026rdquo;\nEverybody turned around to the new voice who had spoken just now. It was the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo;, holding in her arms the very woman that had caused this mess. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d like to turn in a criminal,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed.\nJacob looked at the two blonde women trying to process this exclamation. Considering the strength this Susan possessed, he didn\u0026rsquo;t believe handcuffs would do any good here.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s ok, she is powerless right now,\u0026rdquo; the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; seemed to read their collective thoughts. \u0026ldquo;Although I am a bit surprised that she still looks this way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;C-could s-someone lend me y-you k-know clothes? My outfit kinda disappeared along with my powers.\u0026rdquo; Susan stammered. Now Jacob realized that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t caused by some sudden drop in confidence but rather the simple fact that she was still naked - or again? Whatever the case, she was freezing.\n\u0026ldquo;Here,\u0026rdquo; Deziree threw her a lab coat to cover herself up, but otherwise kept a reserved expression.\nOnce she was at least somehow covered-up, Jacob put the handcuffs on her. Against his expectations, the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; didn\u0026rsquo;t fly off right away but walked over to the table where the last container still stood.\n\u0026ldquo;I hope you don\u0026rsquo;t mind if I take this with me?\u0026rdquo; she asked rhetorically.\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; uhm … go ahead … it\u0026rsquo;s not like we could prevent you.\u0026rdquo; Deziree stammered, clearly intimidated by the god-like woman before her.\n\u0026ldquo;I still appreciate your cooperation.\u0026rdquo; The woman\u0026rsquo;s calm words made Deziree blush.\nWhen Jacobs tried to focus on the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; and her strange request again, a gust of wind blew in his direction as the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; disappeared in a blur - and the container along with her.\nThe aftermath of the whole incident went by like a dream for Deziree. Once the security was informed about the damage, Deziree took her bag and made her way home to recover from this incident at home. James went to continue the autopsy he had interrupted while Jacob accompanied her upstairs, with the still handcuffed Susan in tow.\n\u0026ldquo;What a strange day,\u0026rdquo; Jacob exclaimed as they walked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; Deziree nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, … uhm, how about we grab a cup of coffee together? Not today, of course,\u0026rdquo; Jacob nodded towards Susan who just rolled her eyes in a disapproving manner. \u0026ldquo;Maybe when I stop by here tomorrow morning?\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree looked at him dumbfounded. \u0026ldquo;Yes, t-that would be nice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Great, I\u0026rsquo;ll stop by in your lab tomorrow then.\u0026rdquo;\nThey soon reached the exit and their paths separated there. Jacob pulled Susan to his car, while Deziree made her way to the bus station. She thought about how the day had went so far. From the sudden news about a real life superheroine to her less than successful flirt with Dr. Thompson, and her encounter with a super-powered Susan Harland, not to mention said superheroine coming and saving the day. And now she even had a small date with the cute cop. Her day had turned out quite well after all.\nShe held her handbag close to herself and was revarded with the sound of two vials hitting each other inside. Deziree\u0026rsquo;s face lit up with a genuine smile. After all, today wasn\u0026rsquo;t over yet.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part12/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 12"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"\u0026ldquo;Dr. Thompson, do you have a minute?\u0026rdquo;\nJames turned around to face the woman who had addressed him. He already recognized her voice.\nDuring the brainstorming earlier, she had interrupted several times to ask questions about the recent events - or at least the \u0026ldquo;official version\u0026rdquo; of those.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course, Dr\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; James took a look at her name tag. \u0026ldquo;Archer.\u0026rdquo;\nThe young woman gulped, then blushed as if she just now noticed that they were alone in his lab. \u0026ldquo;Y-you may call me Deziree.\u0026rdquo; She averted her eyes, this shy gesture pretty much underlined her already mousy appearance.\n\u0026ldquo;So what can I do for you, Deziree?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; I uhm\u0026hellip; still have a few questions about the whole story. You see, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t informed about these individuals until this morning, when I saw them on the news. Not really giving me time to form my own theories before the meeting.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, communication isn\u0026rsquo;t really our strong suit here,\u0026rdquo; James admitted. Normally he was just as angry about this fact, but today he had turned the tide by being significantly better informed than others.\nHarland\u0026rsquo;s arrogance had made him miss the information about the mutation not being sexually transferable. Granted, this particular bit of information had been important to James, whose girlfriend just so happened to be the very \u0026ldquo;Angel\u0026rdquo; that was the big news right now. A bit of information that he didn\u0026rsquo;t intend to share with any of his colleagues.\n\u0026ldquo;So far we have four cases of this mutation: Jane Doe, the Angel, the Redhead and the Asian,\u0026rdquo; Deziree began. \u0026ldquo;The latter three have either shown or implied supernatural powers. Especially the ability to fly and enhanced strength. Jane Doe on the other hand died from her drug abuse. Could it be that this drug addiction somehow dampened the beneficial effects this mutation had on the others?\u0026rdquo;\nAn interesting point of view, but James knew that this theory was wrong. From what he had heard, Amanda, \u0026ldquo;the Redhead\u0026rdquo;, took the super potion because she had felt sick and the effects had been just as dramatic as they had been for Michelle. \u0026ldquo;So far, the mutation seems to have canceled out the drug history - including her resistance to the respective drug. My theory right now is that whatever causes these powers is only temporary. According to her diary, Jane Doe had these kinds of abilities for a short time, but thought it was a vivid dream.\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree listened intently. The whole topic obviously fascinated her. \u0026ldquo;A temporary effect? But the Angel has been seen several times now, hasn\u0026rsquo;t she? Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that mean that she has access to whatever caused it and can repeat the process? In that case she could give whoever she wanted superpowers! \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;In theory yes. But as long as we don\u0026rsquo;t have a clue about how this works, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t jump to conclusions.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You may be right, it would be the same mistake Prof. Harland made. Although his proposal sounded a bit over the top to begin with. If you ask me even he wasn\u0026rsquo;t that concerned about these powers being infective.\u0026rdquo;\nThis didn\u0026rsquo;t surprise James half as much as it was supposed to. \u0026ldquo;What makes you think that?\u0026rdquo;\nDeziree looked around carefully, as if to make sure they were indeed alone. \u0026ldquo;I think it\u0026rsquo;s about his daughter. He\u0026rsquo;s been dumping her off in my lab and from what I understand she had an affair with one of the men that got hurt by these superwomen. I think it was the one who got crippled by the redhead.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026hellip;which explains why he was crippled in the first place. James thought. He would\u0026rsquo;ve liked to say it, but that would\u0026rsquo;ve made the fact that the redhead was indeed Fred Riley’s actual girlfriend all the more obvious. In fact Amanda Steward could consider herself lucky that they had pretended to be in a healthy relationship right now.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t say,\u0026rdquo; he commented instead. \u0026ldquo;So he just wanted to avenge his daughters honor?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, daddy\u0026rsquo;s little girl needs to be saved.\u0026rdquo; Deziree suddenly burst out laughing. \u0026ldquo;Sorry, but she\u0026rsquo;s exactly the kind of person I can\u0026rsquo;t stand. It was a huge pain to have her around, and in the last days I barely got anything done because of her. Good thing she hit the town today.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of which, what\u0026rsquo;s your area of expertise?\u0026rdquo; James wanted to slap himself for not asking this earlier.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh me? I\u0026rsquo;m a botanist.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A Botanist?\u0026rdquo; James repeated. \u0026ldquo;So have there been any changes to our local flora that I should know about?\u0026rdquo; He secretly hoped that she would deny it, of course.\n\u0026ldquo;Hm, perhaps?\u0026rdquo; Deziree looked at him seductively. \u0026ldquo;Maybe we could discuss that over dinner?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I fear my girlfriend wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like that.\u0026rdquo; James answered.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I … uhm … sorry that came out wrong.\u0026rdquo; Deziree\u0026rsquo;s face turned crimson as she looked around searching for something to distract them from this awkward situation before suddenly turning around and storming out of the lab.\nJames sighed as the door closed behind her. Partially because of her flirting, partially because she didn\u0026rsquo;t give him a clear answer. After all, he knew that Michelle and Amanda had gained their powers through a mysterious plant. If something like that had been found with the meteor, Deziree would be one of the first to know it.\nAmanda stared at the gun for several seconds before she focused her vision on the person that was holding it. She recognized this man, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t remember from where.\n\u0026ldquo;Step away from the body!\u0026rdquo; The man ordered. His voice was calm, yet direct. Still, the word hurt Amanda on a different level. It reminded her that Erika, a woman who had lived her life to the fullest, now laid lifeless at her feet.\nAmanda did as she was told. With shaky steps she moved away from Erika\u0026rsquo;s motionless body. She felt awful. The man stepped forward and slowly bent down to feel Erika\u0026rsquo;s pulse - all while still pointing the gun at Amanda. Did he believe that she had something to do with Erika\u0026rsquo;s demise?\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s cold\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he began \u0026ldquo;… which means that she\u0026rsquo;s been dead for a while..\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda’s stomach grumbled and she immediately made her way to the bathroom, not caring about the man with the gun while she threw up in the toilet.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m Detective Jacob Spencer,\u0026rdquo; he began once she returned from the bathroom - holding up his badge as proof – thankfully he didn’t point the gun at her anymore. \u0026ldquo;And you are?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Amanda Steward. And - uhm - sorry about that little outburst.\u0026rdquo; She sat down in a nearby chair.\n\u0026ldquo;No problem, finding a dead body is a pretty shocking experience.\u0026rdquo; Det. Spencer then sheathed his gun, took out his phone and called reinforcements in while Amanda tried to process the situation.\nLast night she had been attacked by a strange woman, a woman with powers similar to her own but with no apparent motive for doing so. Now the answer laid dead before Amanda. Erika had somehow transformed into a superwoman similar to Michelle and herself, and obviously intended to take revenge on the redhead that, a few days earlier, had assaulted her brother. Of course Erika didn\u0026rsquo;t know that Amanda had been this redhead - not until last night when Amanda had run out of power and transformed back, right in front of her. Thinking back, it made sense that her attacker suddenly acted a lot more friendly with this revelation. Erika had obviously called her here with the intention of clearing things up. But now she was dead, which left Amanda with the question why this had happened or what had caused this?\n\u0026ldquo;… alright Thompson, get here as soon as you can,\u0026rdquo; Jacob finished his second call before turning to the still brooding Amanda. \u0026ldquo;And now to you. How exactly are you connected to Ms. Riley?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m her brother\u0026rsquo;s girlfriend.\u0026rdquo; A tear ran down Amanda\u0026rsquo;s cheek as she said that. \u0026ldquo;Oh my, how am I going to tell him that his sister died.\nShe didn\u0026rsquo;t see how Jacob raised his brow at this. \u0026ldquo;The police will take care of this if you want. And I need you to stay here for now.\u0026rdquo; He took out a pair of disposable gloves that he put on as he began to investigate the place. Starting with Erika, he soon noticed the ruined outfit scattered on the floor. \u0026ldquo;This looks just like the clothes she\u0026rsquo;s wearing,\u0026rdquo; he commented as he found a single intact boot and placed it right next to its equal counterpart that still sat on Erika\u0026rsquo;s foot. \u0026ldquo;Just bigger.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s strange,\u0026rdquo; Amanda tried to sound just as surprised as the detective. She had already solved this riddle: Erika had used her new powers to recreate the clothes that had gotten destroyed during her fight with Amanda. When she had transformed back to normal, these clothes had shrunk along with her body. No wonder the normal boot that had survived the battle was bigger than its shrunken counterpart. The interesting part was that the clothes hadn\u0026rsquo;t disappeared when she had transformed back. Amanda had experienced something similar, but she had at least more experience with this. Then again Amanda had not been able to create real shoes - whereas Erika\u0026rsquo;s first attempt had been a prefect replica of the boot that she had lost during their struggle. Well, she was always good when it came to fashion, maybe that took over to her super form?\n\u0026ldquo;Ah there you are\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Jacob suddenly exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;seems like she leaves you her wardrobe.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Amanda took a second to get out of her own thoughts. \u0026ldquo;Wait a second, is that … her will? Why the hell had she a will prepared?\u0026rdquo; Had her involvement in the bank robbery shaken her up this much?\n\u0026ldquo;Because she lived her life to its fullest and expected to die every day – that’s how she called it. Even though she doesn\u0026rsquo;t own that much, her will is very thought out. See for yourself.\u0026rdquo;\nUpon looking at Erika\u0026rsquo;s will, Amanda could only agree with him. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t some hastily put together will. It included details about where and how to bury her, whom she wanted to invite at the funeral - and whom not.\nIt didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for the reinforcements to arrive. Amanda had expected them to take the place apart, searching for evidence at every corner. But the truth was that there was nothing indicating that Erika was the victim of a crime, even though Detective Spencer was clearly suspicious about the whole situation. Eventually the will was taken away from Amanda - after all it was an important document about how to proceed now. But Amanda had already read all the important parts.\nThen came the questions, but nothing dramatic. Who was she? What relation had she to the deceased? Why had she come here? All questions Amanda could answer truthfully without having to fear this information might hint at her other self. It all went by as if it was a haze.\n\u0026ldquo;Ms. Steward?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda looked, once again, up to see a familiar face. It was James Thompson, the cute scientist her best friend Michelle was currently dating. As far as Amanda knew he was still unaware of that.\n\u0026ldquo;Dr. Thompson,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed.\n\u0026ldquo;My deepest condolence. I\u0026rsquo;m sure this came unexpected for you.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda simply nodded as she woke from her trance and, for what felt like the hundredth time, wiped away her tears. Normally by now her face would have been red because of all this crying, but this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case. Not that Amanda had the time nor the will to appreciate this little benefit of her superpowers.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahem.\u0026rdquo; Detective Spencer interrupted. \u0026ldquo;Dr. Thompson, if you have a minute?\u0026rdquo;\nJames went over to Erika\u0026rsquo;s corpse to examine what Det. Spencer wanted to show him. Now that Amanda actually paid attention, she could even hear their whispering.\n\u0026ldquo;Two days ago she had a scar just there, but now it\u0026rsquo;s gone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How did you notice a scar there?\u0026rdquo; James asked back.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s just say I met her at a bar and leave it at that. What\u0026rsquo;s important is who else was at the bar.\u0026rdquo; Jacob turned around to check if Amanda could listen to them, and obviously believed that she couldn\u0026rsquo;t. \u0026ldquo;It may be farfetched, but I think the Asian was there as well as a man who could be … well super. I didn\u0026rsquo;t see them, but Eri\u0026hellip; Ms. Riley did.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What has this to do with the scar?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well maybe she found him last night? If this guy was super, maybe he somehow made the Asian super and maybe her as well. I mean she does look a bit better than before, right? And verify her cause of death, will you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The most likely cause is a heart attack, considering her condition. But only the autopsy will verify this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s nothing hinting at a crime - unless you count Ms. Steward finding her at an unfortunate time as evidence. So you\u0026rsquo;ll have to get an approval for an autopsy.\u0026rdquo;\nJames sighed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll see what I can do.\u0026rdquo; Then he looked back at Amanda. \u0026ldquo;Do you still need her here? If she isn\u0026rsquo;t a suspect she\u0026rsquo;s free to go right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sure, just thought that you might want to question her too.\u0026rdquo;\nJames straightened himself back up and approached Amanda again.\n\u0026ldquo;I think we\u0026rsquo;re done here for now. Do you want me to drive you home - or somewhere else?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda thought for a second. A part of her really wanted to go home and lie in her bed until this nightmare was over. But she knew that this would just be running away - and Fred would need her at his side.\n\u0026ldquo;The hospital,\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed.\nFive minutes later they were sitting in James car, driving through the streets. Amanda wondered how to proceed. Knowing that Erika had been super was a shock, but it was disturbing that the detective had picked up on the little hints on that rather quickly. Then again Amanda shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the one to complain. After all, this very sharpness had prevented him from jumping to the wrong conclusion that Amanda had something to do with Erika\u0026rsquo;s death. Not to mention that he had accepted this rather unconventional death easily.\n\u0026ldquo;Can I ask you something?\u0026rdquo; she started.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How would you react if you learned that the person you love kept a really big secret from you?\u0026rdquo;\nJames looked at her quizzically and Amanda realized that she might\u0026rsquo;ve asked the wrong person. After all, two days ago he had been on a date with the very woman who was now the big news because of her preventing a plane crash. After a few seconds James finally answered.\n\u0026ldquo;That would depend on what kind of secret we\u0026rsquo;re talking about. There\u0026rsquo;s always a reason why such a secret is kept and I would need to hear that before deciding whether or not I agree. My girlfriend, for example, can be a bit too trustful at times and I already know private things about her that she might have kept hidden from me for a few more months without me having any reason to feel betrayed by them.\u0026rdquo;\nA shiver went down her spine as she heard that. What exactly did this guy know?\n\u0026ldquo;I doubt these things are on the same level as what I am talking about.\u0026rdquo; At least she hoped as much.\nJames shrugged. \u0026ldquo;Maybe, maybe not. You would need to go into more detail because I sure as hell won\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why not?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s the part about trusting one another. She shared these bits with me because she knew I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t tell anybody. And I don\u0026rsquo;t intend to do that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fair enough. I hope for her sake it stays that way.\u0026rdquo; Amanda sighted. \u0026ldquo;As for me, I\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait and see what he has to say in his defense. Oh and could you do me a favor?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Could you deliver the bad news to him? I need some time for myself before I go to him.\u0026rdquo;\nThe rest of the drive continued in silence. Amanda\u0026rsquo;s day had been too rough to currently care what exactly Michelle had told James - if she even was the girlfriend in question. She had been feeling awful enough all day, even without all the worse after Erika\u0026rsquo;s sudden passing.\nWhen Amanda finally made her way into Fred\u0026rsquo;s hospital room, James had already been gone for over half an hour. She had needed the time to think about their current situation and to ascertain a few things.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey,\u0026rdquo; Fred greeted her weakly. He tried to smile, but the sadness was too obvious for it to be convincing.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have to play tough,\u0026rdquo; Amanda assured him. \u0026ldquo;It would be much more disturbing if you were unaffected by the loss of your last living relative.\u0026rdquo;\nFred closed his eyes. \u0026ldquo;How did you know\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;that the two of you were adopted? It was mentioned in Erika\u0026rsquo;s will.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see.\u0026rdquo; He averted his eyes before actually opening them to stare out of the window. Amanda then took his hand.\nFred turned back to her, holding her gaze as she held his hand. Now he realized that she was on the verge of crying herself. He pulled her over to himself, embracing her as she began to cry into his chest. It took her a few minutes until she calmed herself down again.\nStill leaning onto him, Amanda eventually said \u0026ldquo;Would you care to explain to me why she had a heart attack at her age? How come she even had a will? Did she expect to die?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a smart girl. I\u0026rsquo;m sure you already figured it out.\u0026rdquo;\nShe looked up to face him. \u0026ldquo;It would mean a lot to me to hear it from you\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alright,\u0026rdquo; he sighed. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no reason to hide it anymore.\u0026rdquo; He took a deep breath, making it painfully obvious that he still struggled with what he was about to say. \u0026ldquo;Erika and I suffer from a genetic condition that\u0026rsquo;s commonly known as \u0026lsquo;Harland Syndrome\u0026rsquo;. This -uhm-\u0026rdquo; Fred gasped for air as the force of Amanda\u0026rsquo;s hug had increased as she heard that. \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;causes a creeping degeneration in the human heart, eventually leading to a fatal heart attack. Usually this happens in the late twenties\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;… meaning there\u0026rsquo;s little chance you live until thirty.\u0026rdquo; Amanda finished the sentence. Tears were still flowing from her eyes. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s why Erika lived the life she did. Why she went home with a different man at every opportunity. She knew she couldn\u0026rsquo;t expect a long life, so she lived it to the fullest. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be surprised if she had volunteered to be the hostage back then.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She probably did.\u0026rdquo; Fred continued. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no cure, at least none that\u0026rsquo;s guaranteed to work. So she didn\u0026rsquo;t waste her time and hopes on that, but rather enjoyed her life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And how about you? Why don\u0026rsquo;t you live a similar life?\u0026rdquo; Amanda asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I think it has something to do with our parents. They both had the Syndrome as well and died when we were still young. I have no actual recollection of them but, since Erika was older, she witnessed our parents dying. I think she felt left alone because of that and never had a serious relationship because of that. She said it would be better if there was nobody to mourn her when she died.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But here we are doing just that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;True, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s better this way. If nobody mourned her, she might as well never have existed. It\u0026rsquo;s sad to think that she would leave this world with no legacy whatsoever.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can see why you would try to live a normal life, but why didn\u0026rsquo;t you tell me about your condition?\u0026rdquo; Amanda already could imagine the answer, but she wanted to hear it anyway.\n\u0026ldquo;To put it simply: each time when a girlfriend of mine learned about my condition, this more or less meant the end of our relationship. Either she would break up because she couldn\u0026rsquo;t deal with the situation or I would do so because of the same reason.\u0026rdquo;\nHe shivered as he said that and Amanda didn\u0026rsquo;t need an explanation why. Fred was obviously scared that this would repeat itself now.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you dare break up with me now!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;After all that happened, I\u0026rsquo;m not really in the position to do that, am I?\u0026rdquo; Now it was Fred who hugged her tighter. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just glad you\u0026rsquo;re here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of which, how exactly did your cheating on me fit into this? Did you try to get into one of Harland\u0026rsquo;s test groups?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Pretty much. You even know about those?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Harland was pretty much the reason I failed med school. The whole exam was nothing but the tiniest details of the Harland Syndrome while I had prepared myself to answer questions that were aimed at more than just one genetic sickness. Did I mention I hate his guts?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That seems to be the general consensus. Erika couldn\u0026rsquo;t stand him as well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you banged his daughter\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nFred sighted. \u0026ldquo;Are you reading my mind or something?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No silly, I\u0026rsquo;m just good at putting two and two together.\u0026rdquo; Amanda giggled, but quickly stopped it as she remembered the circumstances. \u0026ldquo;Erika\u0026rsquo;s will had a bit more information than just the fact that you are adopted after all. For example she specifically mentioned that Prof. Christopher Harland is not allowed to perform an autopsy on her no matter what. As far as I know he\u0026rsquo;s only interested in doing that to Harland Syndrome patients - hence the name. Speaking of which, you didn\u0026rsquo;t want to give the name of your affair and only mentioned she had connections. Which fits perfectly for his daughter.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sherlock Holmes got nothing on you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tough luck for you, that I know a bit more about Harland than the average girl. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t change the fact that you cheated on me. And just to be clear, I won\u0026rsquo;t tolerate that a second time!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As if I intended to do that. I seriously doubt that I could sneak into one of the test groups this way. And considering the success ratio, I think I should get used to the idea that m\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda had put her hand on his mouth, effectively silencing him.\n\u0026ldquo;… that your time is running out? Don\u0026rsquo;t give me that!\u0026rdquo; Amanda stared into his eyes. \u0026ldquo;If there was one good thing about this whole ordeal, then it was your will to live. The chances were slim, yet you grasped for every straw you could get. Sure you failed, but the reason for that should be obvious: You failed because you were alone.\u0026rdquo; She then framed his face with her hands, still staring into his eyes. \u0026ldquo;But now I\u0026rsquo;m with you on this. I won\u0026rsquo;t allow you to die so easily. I will find a solution for you to live a long life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have to do that,\u0026rdquo; Fred weakly protested. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have to stick with me just out of guilt.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not doing this out of guilt!\u0026rdquo; Amanda\u0026rsquo;s retort was surprisingly calm. \u0026ldquo;Sure, I\u0026rsquo;m still feeling guilty about your knee, which I intend to fix if possible, but in the bigger picture that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean much. I want to be with you for as long as possible, it\u0026rsquo;s as simple as that. Or do you have any objections?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just one condition.\u0026rdquo; Fred held Amanda\u0026rsquo;s gaze. \u0026ldquo;Marry me!\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda\u0026rsquo;s eyes grew wide as she heard that. Her irises even turned into the fiery orange that was normally part of her super form. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of this, of course, but she couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less anyway. Even the fact that Fred had popped the question without having a ring to present her didn\u0026rsquo;t bother her in the least. Before she knew it, Amanda had thrown her arms around him and kissed him passionately.\n\u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like she\u0026rsquo;s going to show up,\u0026rdquo; Debbie whispered at the scene. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\u0026rdquo;\nBoth she and Michelle were standing in the third row of onlookers in front of a traffic accident. Actually they were only watching the aftermath, but it was enough to dishearten Michelle. They were standing there, watching while the firefighters brought in the necessary tools to free the man that was trapped in the remains of his car. For her super form it would have been an easy feat, but right now she couldn\u0026rsquo;t help the situation at all. Debbie\u0026rsquo;s words only helped to make that clear. Michelle\u0026rsquo;s old and new colleague had only gotten here in the slight hope that the biggest news in town would show up to save the day. Michelle turned to leave as she heard a young girls voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Mommy why doesn\u0026rsquo;t the Angel come to help?\u0026rdquo;\nOnly a child could ask such a question.\n\u0026ldquo;She probably has something more important to do. There are a lot of people out there that need help and she can\u0026rsquo;t help everyone, you know? There is only one person to save now and fire workers have this one covered.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat a surprisingly well thought-out answer. Michelle turned to look at the woman who had just said that. She seemed familiar.\n\u0026ldquo;But when she came to save me, I was the only one to save as well,\u0026rdquo; the young girl retorted. \u0026ldquo;And there were fire workers too.\u0026rdquo;\nNow Michelle remembered where she had seen the woman. Saturday night, after practicing her abilities in the woods, she had returned to find a burning house and immediately jumped into the fire to save whoever was in there. This had been the first time she had used her powers to save someone - a young girl that just so happened to share her first name. A young girl that just had blurted out the fact that she was saved within Debbie\u0026rsquo;s earshot\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;My my,\u0026rdquo; Debbie began, as she approached the little Michelle. \u0026ldquo;So you have seen the Angel on TV?\u0026rdquo;\nThe young girl shook her head. \u0026ldquo;No, she came to save me when our house burned down.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my god, does that mean all your stuff was burned down as well?\u0026rdquo;\nUnexpectedly the young girl nodded and her expression darkened a bit. It seemed like she had forgotten the losses already and was now reminded of them. \u0026ldquo;Yeah, but Dad says we\u0026rsquo;re going to buy new ones from our insu\u0026hellip; insu\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Insurance,\u0026rdquo; Debbie finished the sentence. \u0026ldquo;They usually take some time until they help you. How long has it been since the fire?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Two … three\u0026hellip; no,\u0026rdquo; the girl tried to do the math. Eventually she looked at her mother’s direction for help. \u0026ldquo;uhm how many days ago was Saturday?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Four days. So you have seen the Angel?\u0026rdquo; Debbie answered the question herself.\nThe young girl nodded again.\n\u0026ldquo;How did she look like?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm\u0026hellip; just like on TV actually, but more beautiful. Mom says her eyes were glowing, right mom?\u0026rdquo;\nNow Debbie\u0026rsquo;s attention shifted to the mother who had been watching the situation carefully. No surprise there, what mother would look away while her daughter talked to a stranger? She nodded carefully, clearly not wanting to bring more attention to herself or her daughter. Michelle was glad that she was successful. The crowd obviously didn\u0026rsquo;t believe that the young girl had indeed encountered her. Debbie on the other hand\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Would you like to talk about that a bit more over coffee?\u0026rdquo;\nTwo hours later Michelle finally returned to her apartment, and let out a sigh of relief. In the end the woman didn\u0026rsquo;t have too much to say. Of course Michelle was fine with that, while Debbie would\u0026rsquo;ve preferred juicy details. In fact it felt good to see her namesake being well and healthy.\nShe had barely stepped through the door when she heard the doorbell. A quick glance through the spyhole revealed it to be Amanda.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey,\u0026rdquo; Michelle greeted her friend and immediately found herself being hugged, showing her that Amanda had something on her mind. Not even when she had showed up last Saturday - after her breakup with Fred - had she seemed this shaken.\n\u0026ldquo;What happened?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked once she returned with some coffee from the kitchen.\n\u0026ldquo;Where do I start? Do you want the good news, the bad news or should I switch between them chronologically?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Whatever is fine with you.\u0026rdquo;\nIt took Amanda another thirty minutes to explain every detail about what had happened to her and Fred in the last few days. Starting from them getting back together about him telling her that he knew about her secret identity. About the mysterious attacker who happened to be Erika, Fred\u0026rsquo;s sister, who mere hours later died due to a genetic sickness Amanda hadn\u0026rsquo;t known about. She also explained that Fred\u0026rsquo;s whole cheating had been mostly to find a way to get cured of the very same sickness.\n\u0026ldquo;… and I said yes,\u0026rdquo; Amanda finished her explanation. \u0026ldquo;Now it\u0026rsquo;s all about finding a cure so that \u0026lsquo;until death do us part\u0026rsquo; will be a bit more than a five-year-plan.\u0026rdquo; She tried her best to smile, but the matter was too serious for her to laugh it away with a lame joke.\nMichelle on the other hand was rather shocked to hear that the woman she had saved from a hostage situation had simply died only a few days later. Fortunately she remembered the encounter with her namesake, otherwise she might\u0026rsquo;ve gotten the idea that her actions had been for naught. And right now Amanda needed her support.\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s one thing I don\u0026rsquo;t understand: If Erika had been super, her genes should have been changed dramatically. James said that there were over fifty chromosomes added to our DNA through that.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda waved her hand dismissively. \u0026ldquo;Adding new chromosomes doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean the old ones get changed. The Harland syndrome wasn\u0026rsquo;t cured by gaining super powers. It looks like it was the other way around. Becoming normal again made her weak enough to suffer the fatal heart attack that otherwise could\u0026rsquo;ve taken a few more months or even years.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t know that for sure. From what I can tell I don\u0026rsquo;t really feel weaker or more vulnerable when I transform back.\u0026rdquo; Michelle retorted. \u0026ldquo;But James is investigating this anyway, he took a blood sample from me this morning and will try to find out whether our immune system is affected negatively. But it seems like he\u0026rsquo;s rather occupied with other things too.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda stared at her dumbfounded. \u0026ldquo;D-did you tell him?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm, yeah.\u0026rdquo; Michelle averted her gaze.\n\u0026ldquo;And he\u0026rsquo;s cool with it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, he may have his concerns, but in general he likes it. I even gave him one hell of a show by transforming in front of him.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let me guess: The Angel proved to be rather naughty back then?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Super naughty,\u0026rdquo; Michelle giggled remembering how she had pretty much assaulted James right afterwards. \u0026ldquo;You won\u0026rsquo;t believe how great it was.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I think I do. There\u0026rsquo;s a reason Fred calls me Devil, after all. I\u0026rsquo;m good at being naughty.\u0026rdquo;\nBoth women started to giggle in unison, almost forgetting about the serious topic that they had been talking about earlier.\n\u0026ldquo;Anyway, I wanted to ask you a favor,\u0026rdquo; Amanda eventually continued. \u0026ldquo;As Devil, my mental capacities are greatly enhanced, and since I want to find a cure for Fred\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;… you want a bit more of the potion.\u0026rdquo; Michelle concluded. \u0026ldquo;Of course, take as much as you need.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, Michelle. You really are an Angel.\u0026rdquo; Amanda let out a sigh of relief. \u0026ldquo;But speaking of which, how did it feel to carry a plane? I\u0026rsquo;ve seen the video footage and you seemed pretty exhausted.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh yeah, I actually overused my flight powers back there, but it had some nifty side-effects.\u0026rdquo; Michelle concentrated hard and rose into the air.\nAmanda\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected to see her friend flying in her normal form, even though Michelle\u0026rsquo;s flight was rather short-lived and she landed back onto the cushions after a few seconds.\n\u0026ldquo;How the hell are you doing that without super energy?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Technically we can turn every kind of energy into super energy. It\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of efficiency. When I carried the plane yesterday, I really went all out, but subsequently became more efficient when it comes to flying.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In other words, if we exercise a certain power enough, we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use it even in our normal form?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;To a certain degree, yes. But it\u0026rsquo;s really exhausting since we can\u0026rsquo;t muster much energy in our normal form. Makes me wonder why we\u0026rsquo;re capable of doing that at all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make much sense.\u0026rdquo; Amanda said and put her hand on her chin. A few seconds later she exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;Oh my god, it\u0026rsquo;s so simple.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Remember when you saved that girl from the burning building?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sure, I actually ran into her earlier, but go ahead.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;During that you absorbed the excess heat from the fire and replenished a bit of your super energy, right? Just like you converted my heat vision into super energy as well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In other words we\u0026rsquo;re capable of absorbing excess energy and store it as super energy,\u0026rdquo; Amanda concluded. \u0026ldquo;In hindsight that\u0026rsquo;s the same thing the plants does in order to create the super potion.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t understand. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I\u0026rsquo;m setting it on fire or something. All it gets is water and sunlight like every other plant.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly. The plant absorbs sunlight in order to create super energy. Absorbing heat is basically the same thing - we\u0026rsquo;re just not as good at it yet. And if we can do that in our normal form too\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;… we could eventually become as effective as the plant.\u0026rdquo; Michelle finished, unsure whether or not this was a good thing. \u0026ldquo;Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that mean we\u0026rsquo;d be permanently super?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And it actually makes sense: This plant came from outer space, right? The only thing it could depend on was the light from the suns and other electromagnetic energy on its god-know-how-long-journey.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle stood up and walked towards the window. She believed that Amanda\u0026rsquo;s theory was right, but she wanted some confirmation. So she held out her hand into the sunlight while the rest of her stayed in the shadow. At first, the only difference she felt was the usual warmth that was to be expected from the sunlight. But after a few seconds she felt the slightest hint of something else.\n\u0026ldquo;I can feel something, but I can\u0026rsquo;t really describe it. If that\u0026rsquo;s how absorbing sunlight feels like it\u0026rsquo;ll probably take months until the amount is big enough to cause a transformation,\u0026rdquo; Michelle exclaimed, hoping that she was right.\n\u0026ldquo;D-do you think that one day we\u0026rsquo;ll transform into our super selves and not turn back?\u0026rdquo; Amanda sounded concerned.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. We will still be able to use up all our super energy so we should be able to transform back … but who knows how long we\u0026rsquo;ll stay normal?\u0026rdquo; Michelle imagined herself at work, suddenly transforming into her super self. She would probably end up on the wrong end of the camera before the process was over. \u0026ldquo;It sure would be nice to choose when to transform,\u0026rdquo; she said absentmindedly.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, earlier I ran into a traffic accident and had to watch while the firefighters cut open the car. I just thought to myself that it would\u0026rsquo;ve been nice if I could just slip away from that scene, transform in private and then come to help in my super form. You know, like in a comic book. It\u0026rsquo;s frustrating to watch things knowing that I could help.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You sound like you couldn\u0026rsquo;t chose your transformation at all, while you only have to drink the potion.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Carrying it around with me at all time is a bit risky. What if I lost it, causing it to fall into the wrong hands? What if someone saw me drinking it? And that\u0026rsquo;s only the turning super part. Getting back to normal is another issue since I have to use up all the super energy - meaning that most of it goes to waste.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got a point there. The ability to transform back and forth at will would be very useful to keep our identities secret. But then again maybe we can learn to do it? I mean if you can generate some super energy to use your powers, you can also contain at least some of it without transforming, right?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle thought about this for a second. Last night, when she had demonstrated her transformation to James for the first time, she had managed to gain a certain amount of control over the transformation. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to stop it, but with enough exercise she might be able to. Then she remembered the words from her doppelganger: \u0026lsquo;Unless you really want to\u0026rsquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;You may be right. Our powers are influenced by our minds, so if we really want it, we should be able to learn how to control the transformation.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda raised her eyebrow. \u0026ldquo;That sounds like we could do everything we set our minds on - which I actually doubt. I tried to use healing powers - and trust me, I wanted them - but it didn\u0026rsquo;t happen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe you just lacked the necessary knowledge? I mean we instinctively know how to use the super energy for certain things. But with other skills there are things that go beyond mere instinct and require a bit of research. Like with your heat vision for example. Remember how I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to use it Saturday night? When you transformed on Sunday you accidentally stumbled on this ability. And why? Because you know better about the idea of heat vision. And when you hit me with it, I intuitively learned how to use it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Amanda hesitated. \u0026ldquo;… actually makes sense. When I fought with Erika yesterday, I wanted to provoke her to shoot me with her heat vision so I would get a power-up, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to do it. On the other hand, she was a lot more talented when it came to creating clothes. She knew more about fashion than any of us and her created clothes didn\u0026rsquo;t even disappear when she died. And since she gave me some of her super energy\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Amanda pulled up her shirt to reveal a black bra with red flames. \u0026ldquo;… neither did mine when I transformed back to normal.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle stared at the bra her best friend was wearing. Her own clothes had always disappeared once she transformed back to normal or they separated from her body.\n\u0026ldquo;This is actually a good way to save energy. Creating the costumes uses a lot of energy, after all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Way ahead of you! This way you could create your entire wardrobe and shift its shape to your costume when you transform. You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to care about where to hide your clothes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You make it sound like I could do that, but I can\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If I give you my super energy now, I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to do it as well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have any super energy right now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aw come on,\u0026rdquo; Amanda pouted. \u0026ldquo;Of course I\u0026rsquo;ll need to transform first. Then I can give you super energy and the ability along with it. Come to think of it, this will benefit you twice: I can just give you small amounts of super energy - after all I have a better way of measuring it than you drinking the stuff per drop. This way you can try to prevent a transformation with only a small amount of super energy to contain.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You really want to do this,\u0026rdquo; Michelle sighted. \u0026ldquo;I feel kinda bad taking your help when you have so much on your hands as well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This is just like you to say that,\u0026rdquo; Amanda smiled. \u0026ldquo;I see it like a welcome distraction from these problems. You see in a twisted kind of way a part of Erika literally continues to exist in form of this power-up she unknowingly gave me. It\u0026rsquo;s her legacy and I\u0026rsquo;m sure she would want you to have it as well.\u0026rdquo;\nThere was no denying that. Amanda had given it more thought than Michelle would have expected. Michelle then nodded and went to get the bottle of super serum she had saved over the last days. When she returned, Amanda had already stripped down to her underwear, now wearing nothing but the flame-patterned bra and panties.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, you really saved up a lot of this stuff,\u0026rdquo; she commented as she saw the full bottle. \u0026ldquo;I thought you would have used up a lot more.\u0026rdquo;\nIndeed, Michelle\u0026rsquo;s supply had increased over time. Despite her nightly patrols, she used less of the potion than the plant produced. So she had quickly filled this first bottle and had the next one full as well - each holding ten of their original doses worth of super serum.\n\u0026ldquo;You can have the whole bottle if you want, I\u0026rsquo;ve got more than enough.\u0026rdquo; Michelle then handed the bottle over and Amanda poured herself a big glass of the serum. Michelle guessed it was about two doses.\n\u0026ldquo;This is for Erika,\u0026rdquo; Amanda raised the glass in the air, before she drank its contents.\nThe transformation started immediately. Before Amanda could even put the glass down on the table, her hair had already grown down her back and turned from its not-so-original blonde into the fiery red that Michelle was still getting used to, while her eyes were glowing orange. Within a few more seconds she had grown about a foot in height, gained a decent muscle tone while her breasts grew into the D-cup range. And interestingly her bra grew along with her. Naturally Amanda rose into the air - Michelle knew from experience that this was an almost instinctive reaction to the pleasure of the transformation process.\n\u0026ldquo;This never gets old,\u0026rdquo; Amanda exclaimed, her voice now deeper and sexier. \u0026ldquo;And now to you.\u0026rdquo; She held out her hand towards Michelle.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright,\u0026rdquo; Michelle said as she began to undress herself as well.\n\u0026ldquo;Keep them on!\u0026rdquo; Amanda interrupted.\nMichelle gulped at the added risk. If she failed, her outfit would get torn apart by her growing body, just like her pajamas had done back when she transformed for the first time. She realized that her best friend wanted to motivate her this way.\nMichelle took Amanda\u0026rsquo;s hand and immediately sensed how her friend offered to share the super energy with her. Slowly, she accepted what Amanda had to offer and could feel the energy flow slowly from Amanda to her. Both women were clearly trying to limit this flow as much as possible without halting it altogether. And thanks to this, Michelle wasn\u0026rsquo;t overwhelmed by the sheer amount, so that she actually managed to prevent her body from changing as the energy spread through her body.\nMichelle quickly noticed that her cells reacted differently to the super energy that was flowing into her. While her \u0026lsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; cells simply absorbed the super energy to become more efficient, there were also the \u0026lsquo;super\u0026rsquo; cells - the cells which made up the extra mass of her super form - which were a lot smaller than normal cells right now. Michelle knew that these cells would grow once they were flooded with super energy and thus avoided doing so. This was easier said than done, as her instincts told her to do just that.\nClosing her eyes, Michelle concentrated hard to divert the super energy onto each normal cell. By now every normal cell in her body contained some of the super energy - and the desire to also flood the \u0026lsquo;super\u0026rsquo; cells right next to them only got stronger and stronger. It didn\u0026rsquo;t help that these super cells were spread all throughout her body instead of being concentrated in one area. Michelle then noticed that this desire varied considering which type of cell it was. While most of her \u0026lsquo;super\u0026rsquo; cells were muscle cells - not to mention that she had more \u0026lsquo;super\u0026rsquo; muscle cells than normal ones - it was easier not to flood them with super energy. This was probably due to them not going fully active even in her super form. Despite being fit and toned, her super form could increase its muscle mass to bodybuilder-like proportions when really necessary. Now this was one added benefit.\nOn the other hand, Michelle had thought the cells in her breasts were even easier to control, but this turned out to be untrue. While at first she didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any desire to flood even her normal cells there, once she had reached a certain point it came with full force. Naturally Michelle assumed that she could slowly fill her normal cell and avoid the \u0026lsquo;super\u0026rsquo; cells in between. Unfortunately she had forgotten that just like with her muscles there were a lot more \u0026lsquo;super\u0026rsquo; cells in there as well. Her super breasts were a solid DD cup compared to her usual A cup, after all. And unlike her muscle cells there was no subconscious help to avoid flooding them here\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Ahh\u0026rdquo; Michelle moaned as her concentration fell apart. One tiny moment of distraction and a few of her \u0026lsquo;super\u0026rsquo; cells were flooded with energy, causing them to transform. The feeling of this was so satisfying, that Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t even care anymore and without her resistance the rest of her body followed suit. Since the energy had already spread throughout her body, the transformation didn\u0026rsquo;t even take a second to be over. Her body grew a foot in height while it became more muscular as well. In fact, for an instant, all her muscles were active, meaning that she was even bigger than her usual super form before shrinking back to just that. With this extreme and quick transformation, her wardrobe was literally blown off her, leaving her in nothing but her panties - that struggled to stay intact.\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; Amanda concluded. \u0026ldquo;So much for the first attempt.\u0026rdquo;\nThe bar was still empty, but Susan couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less. She needed a drink. No, she needed a lot of drinks if she wanted to compensate for how terrible she felt. First her so-called boyfriend turned out to be just another guy hired by her father to keep her occupied. And instead of consoling her - or even apologizing - he just dumped her in some botanic lab with this woman Deziree Archer. It was pretty obvious that the nerdish woman couldn\u0026rsquo;t stand Susan, and this didn\u0026rsquo;t lighten her mood in the slightest.\nWhile Susan was good-looking and rich, she still had some struggle with men. They were either stupid jerks that broke up with her after a short while or turned out to be hired by her father to keep her company. Was she that hard to stand?\nNo! It was them who were at fault. One day, she would be in a position where they needed her help and she would be happy to let them suffer for abandoning her.\n\u0026ldquo;What does a young woman like you do at a bar this early,\u0026rdquo; came a voice behind her.\nSusan turned around to see one hell of a hunk. She instantly wondered if she had already drunk so much that she was fantasizing him. He clearly was too good-looking to be an actual person, but apparently he was as real as he could be.\n\u0026ldquo;Cursing the world for my loneliness,\u0026rdquo; she answered. Normally she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t care about whether or not he liked the comment, but right now she was actually nervous about the answer. When he rewarded her with a smile, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but return it as she gazed into his steel blue, almost glowing eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it looks like you need to blow off some steam.\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part11/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 11"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"James Thompson awoke from one of the strangest dreams he ever had and was immediately faced with the most likely reason for this. Michelle was still sound asleep, her lips curled to a smile that begged to be kissed.\nAs tempting as it was, James had woken up for a reason and was now left with the task of getting out of bed without disturbing his girlfriend that had decided to use him as a pillow. Slowly he began to slip away from under her - which turned out to be harder than expected. Even though Michelle was rather small and light, she seemed to subconsciously reach out for him, not letting him go.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh come on, I\u0026rsquo;ll be right back,\u0026rdquo; he whispered more to himself than to her, but strangely she seemed to get the hint. Finally out of bed, he wasted no time as he searched for the way to the bathroom.\nThe white space was exactly like Michelle remembered it, and unsurprisingly her other self was hovering in front of her again.\n\u0026ldquo;Welcome back,\u0026rdquo; her doppelganger greeted her with a smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Good to see you too,\u0026rdquo; Michelle answered. \u0026ldquo;I had a feeling we would meet again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course, after all it is you who makes this possible. I\u0026rsquo;m just glad you came again.\u0026rdquo; Her other self still sported an innocent smile.\n\u0026ldquo;To be honest, so am I. After all, I have a few questions to you.\u0026rdquo; Michelle cut straight to the chase.\nHer other self just smiled in response.\nMichelle began. \u0026ldquo;You are probably aware of my new boyfriend\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh yes,\u0026rdquo; her other self interrupted.\n\u0026ldquo;I have felt that I can somehow read his mind. But surprisingly I was able to do it even when I was not in my enhanced form.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So far, I was only able to use these abilities when I was in that form, when I had this super energy at my disposal.\u0026rdquo; Michelle continued.\n\u0026ldquo;No you didn\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; her other self flatly answered. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s true that it\u0026rsquo;s easier for you to use the super energy as you call it, once your body stores large quantities of it, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you\u0026rsquo;re absolutely powerless without it. Your body does have the capability to turn other forms of energy into super energy and thus manipulate it to use these abilities.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But why wasn\u0026rsquo;t I able to do so before?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You were. How do you think we are talking to each other right now? It\u0026rsquo;s basically the same kind of connection you dubbed \u0026lsquo;Reading his mind\u0026rsquo;.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle looked at her other self, dumbfounded. \u0026ldquo;Does that mean I can read other peoples’ mind as well?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don’t think it is the mind reading you think of,\u0026rdquo; her other self answered. \u0026ldquo;It’s more like a mental bond that allows you to communicate with those close to you, like him and me. I don’t think it will work on anybody you don’t have a connection with – unless you really want that.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure whether or not she liked that. She was glad that she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be peeking into everybody\u0026rsquo;s mind as several pieces of fiction would suggest, but it seemed like this wasn\u0026rsquo;t definite.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean with \u0026lsquo;unless I really want it\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\nHer other self seemed clearly surprised at the question, but quickly regained her smile as she began explaining.\n\u0026ldquo;There are certain kinds of abilities you possess. For one there are the abilities that you gained through your initial transformation, abilities that were embedded into your genes along with your ability to use and manipulate this energy\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She rose a bit higher into the air to emphasize her point. \u0026ldquo;Then there are the abilities that were the results of enhancing your own natural abilities\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She flexed her arms that immediately took on ridiculously defined proportions. \u0026ldquo;And finally there are abilities that you create through your imagination.\u0026rdquo; Suddenly her eyes glowed an even brighter blue and a blue beam shot straight onto the nearby floor, leaving a black mark onto the otherwise perfectly white floor.\n\u0026ldquo;Created through my imagination?\u0026rdquo; Michelle repeated, remembering the time she had learned to use her heat-vision. This had been an ability that Amanda had discovered before she had. In fact, she had tried if she had heat vision before Amanda had even transformed for the first time, but Amanda had still suddenly figured out how to do it. This could only mean\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;The heat vision wasn\u0026rsquo;t created through my imagination at all, it had been Amanda who did it!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed, it seems like your friend had a better imagination about how this ability should work, so she was able to use it before you were. But being the good friend she is, she immediately gave you this information.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah, now I get it. When I absorbed her heat vision back then, I must\u0026rsquo;ve subconsciously picked up how to manipulate the super energy to use heat vision. In a twisted kind of way, Amanda taught me how to do it.\u0026rdquo; It made sense, Amanda had been more into comics than her and several characters there possessed heat vision as a super power. So it was obvious that Amanda had a clearer idea about how heat-vision would work, no matter how subconsciously.\nHer doppelganger nodded affirmatively.\n\u0026ldquo;Your imagination and your creativity allow you to reach heights that I would never be able to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That sounds a bit contradicting since you\u0026rsquo;re the one hovering.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then why don\u0026rsquo;t you join me?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle looked at her doppelganger as if the latter had just said something insane. But now that she thought about it, this was a dream - or at least close enough to being one. The fact that she had reverted to her normal self before getting to bed shouldn\u0026rsquo;t mean anything here, right? She concentrated, normally flying was so easy, it was hard not to do it, but now it felt like actual work. A slight pain began forming in her body - a pain she was awfully familiar with. Only a few hours earlier she had felt it when she had used her flight powers to carry a whole plane - or at least slow down it\u0026rsquo;s descend for a safe landing. This pain was similar, like using a sore muscle - except spread throughout her body. The comparison made sense since Michelle had overused her flight powers back then. Concentrating harder, she could finally feel herself becoming lighter, gravity slowly losing its hold on her. The pain grew, but eventually she felt herself becoming completely weightless. Michelle felt this inner happiness that had made flying her favorite power, despite the strain she felt along with it. Somehow this made things even easier for her, as Michelle felt a strange sense of accomplishment as she hovered inches, then feet into the air. Even though her mobility was nothing compared to what she was capable of when in her super form, Michelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but return her doppelgängers smile.\nJames stared at the scene that was unfolding in front of him. He had only left the room for a few minutes, but the difference was unmistakable. Even in the darkness of the room it was obvious that Michelle was not lying in her bed anymore - but hovering a few feet above it. That wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have surprised him had she been in her superpowered blonde form, but this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case.\nJames had actually barely noticed her return actually, being sound asleep at that time. Well at least he had dreamed about her.\nStepping closer to his hovering girlfriend, he could make out that she was smiling, a gesture he subconsciously mimicked. What\u0026rsquo;s more she seemed to float into his direction as well. As if she was sensing him. Eventually they were only inches apart. James was tempted to touch her, but was afraid that his sudden touch would end her hovering. So he reached out from under her, to catch her in case she would indeed stop flying the moment he touched her. As he put his arms around her bare backside, she indeed seemed to stop flying, but her body remained ridiculously light as he held her in his embrace. A slight moan escaped her lips as her weight slowly increased.\nJames didn\u0026rsquo;t waste any time and lowered Michelle down onto the bed right as she opened her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey sweetheart,\u0026rdquo; he whispered.\nMichelle reached up and kissed him. It took James a second to realize that she seemed a bit exhausted as she did that. This was strange. James could understand if she was sleepy right after waking up, but it seemed more like her hovering just now had put a huge strain on her body.\n\u0026ldquo;How do you feel?\u0026rdquo; He had to know for sure.\nMichelle looked at him, her brown eyes barely recognizable in the darkness yet her expression was pretty clear.\n\u0026ldquo;It feels like every cell in my body aches, but other than that I can\u0026rsquo;t complain.\u0026rdquo; She smiled.\n\u0026ldquo;You do know what you did just now, right?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle nodded slightly. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a lot harder now than in my other form. But it is manageable.\u0026rdquo; She sounded happy about this.\nJames couldn\u0026rsquo;t really claim to feel the same seeing her like this.\n\u0026ldquo;You seem concerned,\u0026rdquo; Michelle whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;I am. Seeing you this exhausted breaks my heart and I don\u0026rsquo;t want that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it\u0026rsquo;s not that bad, you know. Compare it to a workout.You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be concerned if I was exhausted because of that, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A workout takes a bit longer than a minute to get you exhausted.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think I was still exhausted from the whole airplane thing. Lifting it really drove me to my limit and if you hadn\u0026rsquo;t encouraged me to drink the extra doses, I would\u0026rsquo;ve failed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You carried an airplane?\u0026rdquo; James was surprised at how little it actually shocked him. After all he had earlier dreamt something along the lines of Michelle lifting an airplane. What if it hadn\u0026rsquo;t really been a dream?\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah pretty much. And it hurt like hell doing so, maybe I overexerted myself there. But if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t things could\u0026rsquo;ve turned very ugl\u0026hellip;mpf.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle hadn\u0026rsquo;t been able to finish her sentence because James had decided to kiss her. It took over a minute for them to break it.\n\u0026ldquo;Hm,\u0026rdquo; Michelle seemed a bit dizzy as she said that, lying back into her pillow.\n\u0026ldquo;Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?\u0026rdquo; James asked his concern gaining the upper hand over the pride of Michelle\u0026rsquo;s heroic feat.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m just a bit exhausted. Nothing a good night’s sleep can\u0026rsquo;t fix.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s 4am; there isn\u0026rsquo;t much of a good night to sleep anymore. And besides, this might be a side-effect of taking too much of the potion.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle shook her head. \u0026ldquo;No. It was definitely the strain when I carried the plane. Flying back here wasn\u0026rsquo;t fun either since I was almost out of energy. As I said, compare it to a hard workout.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How about taking a small sip from the potion then? Would it make things better or worse?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The problem came with you running out of energy, right? Maybe this is some kind of withdrawal? Taking the potion now would help at first, but eventually it would make things even worse.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The old addiction theory, huh? I\u0026rsquo;ve been wondering about that for some time now and came to the conclusion that this stuff isn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be addictive. We already know that the actual changes come with the first transformation, the following ones have no effect per se.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say that. After all you weren\u0026rsquo;t able to fly before this, weren\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually, I was. It\u0026rsquo;s just that in my current form, I\u0026rsquo;m not able to use as much energy at once. Flying was possible, but through last night I learned how to push myself further. To use this ability efficiently enough so that it\u0026rsquo;s possible even when I\u0026rsquo;m not filled with super energy. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s why I was able to return home with almost no energy left.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So you\u0026rsquo;re saying that it was like an actual workout for you?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle nodded.\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t need the potion right now, but if you really want to make me feel better\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She smiled. Even in the darkness of the room, James could see that it was a wicked smile that didn\u0026rsquo;t require her to finish the sentence.\nHe reached down to kiss her and her sweet scent filled his nose. Thanks to the recent revelations about Michelle\u0026rsquo;s powers, he figured that her current scent was laden with pheromones much more potent than those of any other woman - not that he cared right now. Their lips met and what was originally intended to be a slight romantic gesture soon turned into passionate kissing.\nAs his hands traced her naked body, Michelle let out a slight moan. James couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell whether she was moaning out of pleasure or pain. Most likely a mixture of both. Not too long ago this petite woman had carried a whole airplane. She had also looked very different while she did it. James remembered the differences as he felt her body in the darkness. Compared to the blonde goddess from last night, Michelle seemed rather frail right now, but there was no doubt in his mind that she was indeed the same person.\nMichelle became more active, her legs wrapping around his waist as she kissed him again. Once they broke their kiss, she guided him downwards. He kissed her chin, her neck and moved downward her body as he heard her whisper \u0026ldquo;Here it comes,\u0026rdquo; followed by an audible gulp.\nIt didn\u0026rsquo;t take long for James to figure out what had happened. Michelle\u0026rsquo;s body arced. as she let out a small yelp. James could feel her body turning warmer under him, and he looked up into the direction of her face. Finding her eyes turned out to be a lot easier than expected as he found them glowing as they stared into his own. She was transforming.\nJames could feel his girlfriend changing under him, the feeling of her skin stretching along his as her body grew was amazing - and her moans clearly showed that it was even better from her perspective. Those were unmistakably moans of pleasure. With his hands on her belly, James could feel her abs hardening, turning into the six-pack he had seen on her earlier.\nMichelle took his hands and guided them back upwards, and James realized what she intended. Cupping her still A-cup breasts he could feel a slight rumble from them right before they started expanding. It was unbelievable. Having seen her transformation before, James would\u0026rsquo;ve compared the growth of her breast to balloons filling with air, but the feeling of it happening with his hands was on a whole different level. He could feel a strange warmth emanating from them as they rose like loaves of bread under his hands, pushing them back. Instinctively, James tried to push back, squeezing Michelle\u0026rsquo;s expanding breasts in the process.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my god!\u0026rdquo; she screamed as her body suddenly began shaking involuntarily, rising from the bed in the process. James quickly felt himself getting lifted up as well, clinging to Michelle\u0026rsquo;s weightless body as the latter came in midair. He wondered if she simply wanted to prevent her superpowered orgasm to destroy her bed or whether it was her instincts taking over. As if to answer his question, Michelle suddenly hugged him with a force that should\u0026rsquo;ve killed him three times over - but only made it hard for him to breathe. She was ignorant of that fact as she was still lost in the extreme pleasure she was feeling right now - yet at the same time she subconsciously prevented herself from actually hurting James. Just as the desire for air became a critical part of his thought process, James felt the ridiculous strong grip on him weaken allowing him to restock on the precious oxygen all while Michelle\u0026rsquo;s orgasm subsided.\nHe slid down her body. Now that he thought about it, Michelle had reached climax so fast, he had barely gotten started. Talk about being easy to please, he thought to himself, as he watched Michelle enjoying her afterglow in midair. Her sweet scent still completely filled the room and James didn\u0026rsquo;t really want their lovemaking to be over already. He kissed his way down her body, starting at her now massive breasts which immediately caused Michelle to moan even more, working his way over her steel hard abs down to her neither region. Her hovering really came in handy here – Michelle just rose higher instead of James getting lower. Upon reaching her dripping sex, he wasted no time and immediately began eating her out.\nMichelle’s orgasm had barely begun to subside as she felt James kisses travel down, along her body. The pain of her earlier overexertion seemed like a distant memory now. Just like she had expected, the super energy had washed it away during her transformation. She had activated her super senses immediately and with the added sensitivity the feeling of her changing body against his has been enough to drive her over the edge. And now that James was moving down her body she didn’t want to deactivate them. What reason would she have to decrease her pleasure anyway?\nEverything felt just right to her now. Without a second thought, she had opened up a telepathic link to her lover, hearing whispers of his thoughts, feeling his emotions, his lust, his love. She could even tell how her own body tasted like for him as she rose further into the air. God this felt great. And here she had thought their previous lovemaking right before her patrol had been out of this world, but this was at a whole different level. Who would have thought that super senses had this kind of benefit? But that wasn\u0026rsquo;t all there was to it. Michelle had assumed that the feeling of heat vision on her breasts had been the most pleasurable thing she had ever felt, but this was no longer true. No matter how great it felt for bullets to bounce off her invulnerable chest or pure energy be just as ineffective - actually making her more powerful in the process - nothing beat the warmth of the human touch that actually intended to pleasure her.\nThe pleasure between her legs was reaching a new high point and Michelle found herself mentally cheering James on as his tongue worked her most private parts. And sure enough he readily followed her mental wishes showing that their telepathic connection was indeed no one-way road. Once again Michelle began to feel her climax approaching, and the super energy inside her body seemed to intensify. She could feel a lot of it flowing into James, shielding him from the incredible forces her body was capable of. As a matter of fact, her legs were pressing against his head with more force than a scrap metal press, but she knew that it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like that for him. From his perspective it was more like the force any normal woman\u0026rsquo;s thighs could muster. Just as she realized that he had absolutely no fear of accidentally being hurt by her, her second orgasm hit her like an atomic bomb.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhhh,\u0026rdquo; she screamed as her body shook involuntarily. The super energy inside her was suddenly going through her like a series of electric shocks - extremely pleasurable electric shocks. It was such an incredible mixture. While her body was experiencing physical pleasure that she couldn\u0026rsquo;t have dreamt of, Michelle’s mind reveled in the feelings she picked up from James. As trivial as it sounded, nothing felt better than to know for a fact that the man she was with right now genuinely loved her. Forcing her legs apart a bit, she released the grip she had on James' head. With a quick movement, she hauled James on top of her, kissing him deeply as a thanks for the pleasure that was still coursing through her body.\nMichelle then put her legs around him again, slowly guiding his member into her still quivering sex. Even though she had come twice already, her lover still had yet to do so and Michelle wouldn\u0026rsquo;t let that slide. Still engulfed in their kiss, Michelle opened her eyes to see a faint blue glow in James' eyes. For a second she wondered if she had somehow affected him in a way she hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected, but then quickly realized that it was the glow from her own eyes that was reflected in his.\nEntwining his fingers with her own, Michelle stretched their arms out as they were still locked in their kiss and their eyes locked into each other’s. She kept them both afloat with her flight powers as she began the next step in their lovemaking. All over her body, tiny threads appeared. Instead of forming her costume or any kind of clothing for that matter, these threads began to gently caress James' body while her vagina began massaging his member.\nShe had to keep herself from laughing out loud as she saw James' eyes widen at the sudden sensations he was experiencing now. Oh my god, how are you … this is incredible … I can\u0026rsquo;t believe you can do that. James thoughts were pretty messed up, but Michelle knew what he was trying to convey. After all, like everything else, her control over her private parts was incredible which enabled her to massage him in ways he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have believed possible. She closed her eyes to fully concentrate on the task at hand.\nThe afterglow of her second orgasm was beginning to subside - only to be replaced by the buildup of her third one. Through her mental connection Michelle knew that this time she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the only one to reach the climax. Opening her eyes again she noticed that the glow in her own eyes had intensified as she now illuminated his whole face. Once again the feeling of the super energy inside her seemed to intensify even though it hadn\u0026rsquo;t grown weaker since the last time. Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t even have time to wonder about that as both she and James came together.\nLike before, waves of super energy bolted through her body like electric shocks, but instead of spasming uncontrollably, Michelle was perfectly still - she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to jeopardize the embrace she shared with James. The energy inside her on the other hand was going wild and she almost got lost in the sheer amount of pleasure. She instinctively concentrated on her mental connection with James and through his eyes noticed that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just her eyes that were glowing now. Her entire body was beginning to emit a faint glow as the super energy coursed through it. Michelle had no idea why this happened, but it felt far too good for her to care. The couple kissed again while their pleasure seemed to last forever.\nNever before had Michelle felt so happy. As she enjoyed the afterglow, she could finally allow herself to land on the bed again. Together in total happiness. Through the mental connection she could tell for a fact that he loved her unconditionally. Sure there were doubts, fears and even concern about her condition, but that didn\u0026rsquo;t change the simple fact that he had fallen for her - and she for him. And with this in mind, the still embracing couple entered the realm of dreams.\nAmanda soared through the early morning sky. The city was still fast asleep but the redheaded supergirl felt more awake than ever. She had spent the whole night in her super form and - most importantly - with her boyfriend at the hospital. While it was a pain to hide whenever the nurse came to check his status, Amanda still considered it one of the best nights of her life so far. Unfortunately, she still had to work early, and was about to get home to change - in more ways than one.\nAs she flew over the park, she was still lost in thought. Now that Fred knew about her powers he clearly wouldn\u0026rsquo;t keep the reason for his cheating concealed from her any longer. After what felt like eternity for her, things were finally looking up again.\nUnfortunately for her, Amanda wasn\u0026rsquo;t looking upwards right now, causing the attack to hit her without warning. A loud thud and a slight pain went through her back as she was propelled towards the ground. With a loud boom her body crashed into the ground, dirt flying everywhere.\nIt took Amanda a second to realize what had happened: Someone had punched her right out of the sky. And considering the fact that she actually felt the punch - not to mention that she had been flying quite high anyway - the attacker would need to have superpowers as well. As Amanda got back up and out of the crater she had created, she instinctively wished the attacker to be Michelle and the attack to be nothing more than a weird prank. Her heart dropped as she spotted her attacker.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t Michelle. The woman that hovered above had the same kind of physique that both Amanda and Michelle had gained along with their powers, but her jet black hair and matching black eyes made it clear that this was a totally different woman. Those eyes stared at her with a furious anger that drove away the last shreds of doubt that this beauty had indeed attacked her. The raven haired woman hovered a few inches above the ground with her arms crossed. She wore a red leather jacket that struggled to keep her enormous bust in check as well as a black skirt and matching black boots.\n\u0026ldquo;Who are you?\u0026rdquo; Amanda tried to sound as calm and intimidating as she could. This was easier said than done since her improved eyesight was able to see the amount of super energy her attacker possessed. And it was quite a bit more than Amanda had at her disposal. After all Amanda had spent the whole night in this form and would soon run out of power.\n\u0026ldquo;I could ask you the same,\u0026rdquo; the other woman sneered. \u0026ldquo;But I doubt that you would answer honestly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you want?\u0026rdquo; Amanda knew that negotiations were her best bet here.\n\u0026ldquo;How about I beat the crap out of you?\u0026rdquo; With this the other women shot straight at Amanda.\nAmanda managed to dodge at the very last moment. As her attacker flew past her, she managed to launch a counterattack by punching her right into the stomach. Amanda felt her fist going through the relatively soft leather of her opponents jacked and then hitting the rock hard stomach.\nThe force of her punch shot her opponent onto the ground where she ripped a long scar into the park meadow. Sure enough, her opponent rose again, her expression even more angered than before. The black-haired woman didn\u0026rsquo;t wait long before launching another attack. Once again she came straight at Amanda, who attempted to counter in a similar way. But her opponent had anticipated this, stopping in midair right before she would\u0026rsquo;ve passed Amanda - whose punch hit nothing but air this way.\n\u0026ldquo;Take this,\u0026rdquo; the raven haired beauty said as she spun around in midair to deliver a kick right into Amanda\u0026rsquo;s stomach. It connected with a loud boom.\nThe redheaded woman felt how the air left her lungs and how the super energy concentrated in her stomach to prevent any damage to her. Still, the velocity of the kick caused her to fly several hundred feet backwards before she managed to stabilize herself.\nGasping for air, Amanda looked back at her enemy. She was almost out of super energy while her enemy was still as good as new. With such a huge difference in power, the battle was already over. Amanda\u0026rsquo;s only chance was to get her opponent to somehow waste a lot of super energy. But how would she do it?\nHer enemy was approaching again, this time slowly floating towards her with an arrogant smile on her face. Amanda noticed that the other woman\u0026rsquo;s outfit had suffered quite a bit during the battle. The red leather jacket had been ripped open by the force of Amanda\u0026rsquo;s punch, exposing her enemies toned midriff. The right boot had suffered even more and was nowhere to be found. It seemed like the kick earlier had utterly destroyed it.\nA smirk appeared on Amanda\u0026rsquo;s face, if she played her cards right, she might win after all. She concentrated the super energy in her eyes and shot two orange beams of heat vision at her opponent\u0026rsquo;s remaining boot, cutting it open, and then proceeded to do the same with the left sleeve of the other woman\u0026rsquo;s jacket.\n\u0026ldquo;H-hey stop it,\u0026rdquo; the other woman complained as she realized that Amanda\u0026rsquo;s attack were more focused on her wardrobe than herself. \u0026ldquo;This isn\u0026rsquo;t hurting me at all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You attack me out of nowhere and now you complain about cheap shots?\u0026rdquo; Amanda teased.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, two can play this game!\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda could barely prevent herself from laughing. She had used her last bit of power to provoke her enemy to do just that. A few days ago when she had first used her heat vision, Amanda had learned that it was utterly ineffective against another superpowered person. Instead of being hurt, this person would absorb the blast and turn it into super energy. Amanda had carefully aimed at her opponent’s wardrobe mainly because the other woman\u0026rsquo;s answer would replenish her supply of super energy a bit, evening the odds to actually give her a fighting chance.\n\u0026ldquo;Argh, how do you do it?\u0026rdquo; The raven-haired women said in frustration.\nNow that wasn\u0026rsquo;t part of Amanda\u0026rsquo;s plan. She had feared that the other woman knew about the way heat vision was absorbed, but hadn\u0026rsquo;t anticipated the possibility that her opponent might not even know how to use this power. Damn, and Michelle had been able to use it right away\u0026hellip;\nThe raven-haired beauty visibly tried to mimic her stunt, but with no success. The super energy concentrated in her eyes, but she didn\u0026rsquo;t shoot anything out of it. Eventually she gave up and looked back at Amanda - surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not glowing the way you did before\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed.\nAmanda bit her lip. This girl had no idea of the powers she possessed, that she could see Amanda\u0026rsquo;s lack of super energy. She didn\u0026rsquo;t even know that she had pretty much won this battle already. It was so frustrating. In a fair battle, Amanda would have had the upper hand; her superior knowledge would have allowed her to defeat this woman. But this woman had attacked her when her energy was low to begin with - and to add insult to injury she hadn\u0026rsquo;t even knowingly used this advantage! Amanda\u0026rsquo;s thoughts raced. She remembered how Fred had mentioned that the cops were searching for another superwoman that had injured a man. Was this her?\n\u0026ldquo;Is this your first time transforming?\u0026rdquo; Amanda asked. Continuing the fight was futile, so negotiating was all she had left. Maybe she could gain a vital piece of information and - hopefully - survive this whole ordeal. She shuddered at the realization that her life might actually end shortly - just because some random chick attacked her out of nowhere.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you really think I want to chat with you?\u0026rdquo; the other woman retorted. Once again she flew straight into Amanda\u0026rsquo;s direction crossing the distance in the blink of an eye.\nAfter her failed attempt at a counter attack, Amanda decided it would be better to dodge. But her enemy had decided to go into close combat as well, throwing a series of punches that Amanda was barely able to dodge. In fact each punch was getting closer and closer to connecting and after a series of five misses, Amanda was hit straight into her face.\nThe force of the punch was not as big as the previous ones, but the effect was a lot more than before. Previously, her super energy had prevented any damage from happening, but with her supply running low this couldn\u0026rsquo;t be prevented anymore. Amanda\u0026rsquo;s nose broke under the punch and within a few microseconds healed itself with the remaining super energy she had left. Even though the injury lasted for such a short time, the pain of having her nose broken remained for much longer.\nStumbling backwards due to the punch, Amanda was too disoriented to pay attention to her enemy. The other woman was surprised that her punch had done any damage, so she didn\u0026rsquo;t immediately land another one. Instead, she prepared a lashing kick aimed at her left knee.\nAmanda didn\u0026rsquo;t have the slightest chance at dodging. With no super energy left, all she managed was to look helplessly as the other woman\u0026rsquo;s bare foot connected with her knee and a series of disgusting crunching sounds went through her body as she lost her balance. Only when she hit the ground, did the pain finally reach her brain.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahhh,\u0026rdquo; Amanda screamed out in pain. This was it, the fight was over - She had lost. There was no super energy left to heal this wound. What\u0026rsquo;s more, with no super energy left, her body also reverted back to her normal self. The fact that her bones tried to shrink back to her usual position only multiplied her suffering.\nLooking back up, Amanda barely saw her opponent anymore. Without her powers, she was almost unable to make out the other woman in the darkness, and the tears in her eyes didn\u0026rsquo;t help either. She felt the other woman chowing her lightly, causing Amanda to lie on her back. Now Amanda realized that she was naked - her costume had disappeared along with her powers.\nNext the black haired beauty put her bare foot onto Amanda\u0026rsquo;s chest. For some reason Amanda didn\u0026rsquo;t find this victory pose to be that inconvenient. Mostly because the other woman didn\u0026rsquo;t apply too much pressure and her foot was a lot warmer than the cold floor she was lying on. Too bad it didn\u0026rsquo;t help with the pain that was still throbbing through her leg.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026hellip; so this is who you really are?\u0026rdquo; the other woman sounded a bit surprised and even removed her foot. \u0026ldquo;But why did your clothes disappear?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda forced herself to chuckle, but the pain made it turned it into a gasp at best, leaving no doubt that it was fake. \u0026ldquo;Do you really think I want to chat with you right now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are aware that you\u0026rsquo;re at my mercy right now, right? Can you imagine what happens if I apply a bit more pressure here?\u0026rdquo; she put her foot back on Amanda’s chest to empathize her point.\n\u0026ldquo;My ribcage will break, puncture my lung and I will die,\u0026rdquo; Amanda answered flatly. \u0026ldquo;If that\u0026rsquo;s what you want I suggest you get it over with.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re talking about your own death as if it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mean anything. But with my foot so close to your heart I can literally feel your pulse and know that you lie. Who do you try to impress? It\u0026rsquo;s only natural to be scared of death. Even if you have always been prepared for the case of your own death, this fear simply can\u0026rsquo;t be prevented\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda gritted her teeth; the other woman had a point here. The idea of dying here scared her to no end. What good would all the hardships of the last days have been if she died now?\n\u0026ldquo;Just because I fear death doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I\u0026rsquo;ll give you any kind of information. You came here to beat me up and reached your goal. There\u0026rsquo;s absolutely no reason for me to help you in any way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seems like you\u0026rsquo;re not valuing your life enough. Aren\u0026rsquo;t there people who\u0026rsquo;d miss you if you died? Do you really want to burden them with the sadness of losing you just because you don\u0026rsquo;t want to tell me about your magically disappearing outfit?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda\u0026rsquo;s eyes narrowed, an expression that failed to intimidate considering the tears that still lingered in them. \u0026ldquo;Are you threatening my friends?\u0026rdquo; she spat.\nThe other woman\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened in return. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not what I said.\u0026rdquo; She looked around nervously. \u0026ldquo;W-What kind of monster do you think I am?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Someone who kills over fashion advice.\u0026rdquo; Amanda gritted her teeth to fight of the pain in her leg.\nThis seemed to reach the other woman as she looked around, obviously thinking about how to proceed. Sure enough the hypocrisy of asking a naked woman for clothes and threatening her despite her already being injured got to her.\n\u0026ldquo;It’s not like I attacked you entirely without a reason, you know?\u0026rdquo;\nSeconds passed until it seemed like the raven-haired beauty had come to a conclusion. But instead of saying something, she simply looked back down to Amanda. It took a while until Amanda realized what the other woman was doing. Through the pain in her legs, she had trouble noticing the increasing warmth in the other woman\u0026rsquo;s foot on her chest. But now that she noticed, she quickly understood the reason behind it: The other woman had decided to share some of her super energy with her. All Amanda had to do was accept it and\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Ahh..\u0026rdquo; Amanda moaned as the energy suddenly flooded into her, causing her to quickly transform back into the red-headed amazon she had been a few minutes earlier. Her breasts surged outward while her whole body gained in size. But what was most important to Amanda right now, was that her ruined knee settled back in position and healed within seconds as well. Soon enough the other woman halted the stream of power and waited until Amanda\u0026rsquo;s transformation was over.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, it looks a lot more impressive on you than it felt for me,\u0026rdquo; the raven-haired beauty exclaimed absentmindedly.\nAmanda avoided a grin as she went back up – this statement proved that the other woman had only transformed once so far.\n\u0026ldquo;So are you going to tell me about your outfit now? I fixed you, now tell me how to fix my wardrobe!\u0026rdquo;\nHad she repowered Amanda just to ask this question? Amanda wondered if the other woman wasn’t as malevolent as she had originally expected or if she was simply nuts.\n\u0026ldquo;Just imagine the clothes you want to wear and create them.\u0026rdquo; While she said that, Amanda created a black bikini with red flames in the same vein as her costume had been. Amanda avoided mentioning the energy consumption. This woman could see the super energy and she had witnessed her using it right now, so she couldn’t blame Amanda if she overdid it.\nThe other woman nodded and looked down at her bare foot. Sure enough she summoned the strange material and willed it to form a perfect replica of the boot that had been destroyed during their fight. Amanda was rather impressed with that. While she knew herself that the creation process was rather intuitive, she had struggled with the creation of acceptable boots on her costume. The boots she had come up were basically socks with thicker soles. But this woman had managed to even create heels.If only she had figured out the heat vision just as easily as this, Amanda thought to herself.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha! That sure beats the hell out of shopping for an outfit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, I gotta go.\u0026rdquo; Amanda prepared to leave.\n\u0026ldquo;What? Why?\u0026rdquo; The other woman pouted, but only for a second. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t tell me you have to go to work already?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As a matter of fact I do.\u0026rdquo; Amanda didn\u0026rsquo;t see any reason for her to hide that part as she rose into the air. The other woman had seen her true self, after all.\n\u0026ldquo;Well then, I should let you go, I guess. After all I’ll remember your face.\u0026rdquo; The other woman made no intention of stopping or following Amanda. In fact she waved her goodbye.\nHalf a minute later Amanda landed inside her apartment. She was still shaken up by the encounter with that strange woman. There were so many questions about her floating in her head. Why had she attacked her? And why had she stopped? Who was she? Where had she gotten her powers from? How much did she know? Why had she healed her in the first place? Remembering the fight and the humiliation that had come with it, Amanda involuntarily clenched her fists. Immediately her arms exploded in size, the dormant musculature sprang to life as she flexed her muscles and the effect began to spread over her shoulders, back and her entire body. Normally Amanda would\u0026rsquo;ve prevented such a hulk-out to happen because it used up a lot of super energy, but right now that was her intention. Her shift was going to begin soon and she had to use up her reserves in order to transform back.\nThe effect hadn\u0026rsquo;t even covered her whole body when she finally ran out of super energy, causing her to transform back again. A few seconds later when Amanda looked into the mirror the titanic redhead had turned back into the usual blonde\u0026hellip; that was still wearing the black bikini with red flames on it. Amanda looked down at herself, surprised. \u0026ldquo;Why the hell didn\u0026rsquo;t you disappear?\u0026rdquo;\nThe first ray of sunlight was enough to wake Michelle up. She opened her eyes slowly and could barely believe how awake she felt. It took a second for her to remember that she was still in her super form, lying in bed entangled with James just like she had been when she fell asleep. How much time had passed since then? Couldn\u0026rsquo;t be that long since her energy supply didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any lower than before. In fact she still felt like she had the full dose worth of energy - maybe her sleep had halted her energy consumption.\n\u0026ldquo;Hmm\u0026rdquo; she heard a slight moan coming from her chest. Unsurprisingly it came from James whose head rested on her breast and who was in the process of waking up as well. \u0026amp;quot M\u0026hellip;morning,\u0026quot; he yawned before reaching up to kiss her - a gesture that caused Michelle to become airborne right away.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How are you feeling?\u0026rdquo; James still seemed concerned.\n\u0026ldquo;Super, as if I had slept for days.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No more pain because of the plane?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Absolutely none, see I can barely keep myself grounded as it is.\u0026rdquo;\nJames broke the kiss and looked down. Sure enough he saw that Michelle had lifted them a few feet above the bed by now.\n\u0026ldquo;You really are amazing,\u0026rdquo; he finally spoke out. His expression showed the surprise as he realized that up until now their whole conversation had been mental in nature. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re reading my mind again?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you want to call it that way.\u0026rdquo; Michelle rolled her eyes. \u0026ldquo;But I prefer calling it our private channel.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now that has a nice ring to it.\u0026rdquo; He kissed her again.\n\u0026ldquo;Do they really think we\u0026rsquo;ll believe this stuff?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no way that actually happened.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that a sign that the end is near?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda was beginning to tire of the comments she had heard all morning long. They all regarded the news about a real-life angel preventing a plane-crash. The video footage confirmed Amanda\u0026rsquo;s immediate suspicion that it was Michelle who had done that. This was it. The existence of super powers were becoming public knowledge and Michelle clearly had done a great job for a first official rescue. Now she was even compared to an angel while Amanda herself had decided for the codename \u0026lsquo;Devil\u0026rsquo;. It couldn\u0026rsquo;t get more ironic than that. When it came to Amanda, all seemed to go according to plan - if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for some random chick showing up out of nowhere to first beat her up and then act as if they were best friends.\nThe gossip didn\u0026rsquo;t include any other superwoman, though. Neither the black-haired newcomer nor her own alter ego had made the news so far, not to mention any other possible person with access to the plant potion. Still the idea that a woman had prevented a plane crash by carrying the plane to safety - sounded too strange for most patrons in the restaurant for them to believe it.\nThe only thing that distracted Amanda from the sudden fame that her best friend had achieved and the assault by this other superwoman was one text message from Erika in which she asked Amanda to come by after work. Amanda pondered the implications of that. Maybe Erika had decided to tell her whatever Fred was still hiding? That would be nice, although she was pretty sure that Fred would sooner or later come clean with her. After all, he knew about her powers now. For some reason this sounded only half as good as it had felt last night.\nA small rumble in her stomach had been the only warning for Amanda before she realized that her feeling not so good wasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely psychological in nature. Before she knew it, she was speeding towards the bathroom, barely opening up the toilet seat before throwing up. Amanda wondered why she suddenly felt this nauseous, but after a short while this feeling subsided. She probably had eaten something bad, or she was getting sick again.\nWith a chuckle she remembered how she had cut short her last cold by simply drinking the potion. If she really was getting sick, she should better ask Michelle for another dose to get herself back on track. Now that she thought about the healing capabilities of the potion, she also realized that this would probably heal Fred\u0026rsquo;s ruined knee as well. Why hadn\u0026rsquo;t she thought about that sooner? And what\u0026rsquo;s more, why did it feel like a horrible idea right now? Some part of her was definitely against it, even though she couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine why. Amanda then decided it would be best to have a chat with Michelle about that. She somehow felt like it had been ages since they last talked with each other.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you going to be alright?\u0026rdquo; James eventually asked as they watched the news.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course I am,\u0026rdquo; Michelle retorted. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just another day at work for me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes but this work happens to be the lion\u0026rsquo;s den when it comes to people chasing you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know how this goes, they won\u0026rsquo;t even expect their newest scoop walking around in their middle. And the incident took place in a whole different city to boot.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Unless you begin to fly again\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; James joked.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s unlikely. I mean I can fly right now, but it\u0026rsquo;s quite a strain and won\u0026rsquo;t happen accidentally.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The question is: For how long?\u0026rdquo; James sounded more serious now. \u0026ldquo;You said you took about an hour to fly around the world last night before you saved that plane. But just earlier when you did so again, you managed it in about half the time. In other words your little workout made you twice as fast as you were before. If you keep this trend up you might be able to fly with no problem eventually \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;I did have to use up all the energy to transform back, after all. But you have a point there. The more I use it, the more efficient I get. But there has to be a limit to that as well. I mean it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to be more than 100% efficient, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed. But I wonder what else you\u0026rsquo;ll be capable of once you reach that level. You can already fly in your normal form, so it\u0026rsquo;s entirely possible for you to be stronger and more resilient as well. We should try and measure things to be sure.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean like some kind of fitness checkup? Sounds nice, but we have to be careful not to draw attention about that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a given. I\u0026rsquo;ll see if I can arrange some place to test things out in private. It might be helpful to bring your friend too, after all she is the only comparison we have.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle bit her lip as she heard that. She just realized that she had given away the fact that Amanda had drunk the potion too a bit too easily. Even though she trusted James on this, Amanda might see this differently.\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll see what I can do.\u0026rdquo;\nEven though Michelle had said that she would be fine, she still had a bad feeling when she arrived at work. Wherever she walked, people were talking about her nightly escapades.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m telling you, this is a sign. First fire from the sky, now a real-life angel, trust me this is a sign that the end time is near!\u0026rdquo; came the voice of one of Michelle\u0026rsquo;s more religious colleagues when she entered her department.\n\u0026ldquo;Get a hold of yourself, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the bible channel!\u0026rdquo; This voice belonged to Debbie Lynton a former reporter at the station. Debbie had moved out of town quite some time ago, so Michelle was visibly surprised when she saw her former colleague who looked at her with the same look of surprise. \u0026ldquo;Holy mother of god, Jenkins is that you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t you just say this is not the bible channel? And yes it is me.\u0026rdquo; Michelle had to chuckle at the reaction. The whole company had quickly grown accustomed to her new improved looks but Debbie didn\u0026rsquo;t know about that. \u0026ldquo;What brings you back here, Debbie?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Work, of course. I\u0026rsquo;m after a huge story, and as fate wants it, the story led me back to my old home.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see, well too bad you missed the current hot scoop by about a hundred miles,\u0026rdquo; Michelle joked, hoping that the other woman wouldn\u0026rsquo;t see through her lie. Debbie was good when it came to investigating after all.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got no idea how many times I heard that joke today, Michelle. But speaking of which, what is your opinion about that incident last night?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s quite hard to believe, if that\u0026rsquo;s what you mean. But I\u0026rsquo;m not really a fan of the whole \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; story they make of it. The video material clearly shows that the wings only served to carry the plane - as strange as it is - but nothing more.\u0026rdquo;\nDebbie nodded affirmatively. \u0026ldquo;Finally someone who stays logical when it comes to this.\u0026rdquo; She then stepped closer to Michelle and lowered her voice. \u0026ldquo;I could use some help for my story. My information network here isn\u0026rsquo;t what it used to be since I left. In fact I can be happy for this incident taking place in another city since this gives me a head start.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle gulped as she realized the implication. \u0026ldquo;You mean your story is bigger than that?\u0026rdquo;\nDebbie shook her head slowly. \u0026ldquo;One of my contacts at the police mentioned that a woman who sounded suspiciously like the one from last night has been flying around here lately.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So that\u0026rsquo;s what you mean with a head start. Since the incident happened hundreds of miles away people would expect her to be from around there. But if she get\u0026rsquo;s spotted here, any witnesses will be quick to mention if it really is the same person.\u0026rdquo; Michelle was surprised at how easily she managed to talk about herself in third person.\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly. And if my contact is to be believed - upon which I have no doubt since last night - then there is at least one more woman with these kinds of powers out there. It\u0026rsquo;s only a matter of time until that goes public and then we\u0026rsquo;ll have another meteor scare going on here. I\u0026rsquo;d like to have a more funded base of information by the time this happens. So what do you say?\u0026rdquo;\nNow Michelle was faced with a dilemma. Debbie was one of the few reporters that still held up Michelle\u0026rsquo;s ideals, someone who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t add fuel to the fire if there wasn\u0026rsquo;t any valid reason for it. She wouldn\u0026rsquo;t turn the story into a second meteor scare. On the other hand she was already a big part of this story. Cooperating with Debbie meant risking her finding out about Michelle’s alter ego. But then again, there were still other superwomen out there which required Michelle\u0026rsquo;s attention. It would be easier to find them if she became part of the investigation.\nShe nodded slightly. \u0026ldquo;Just like the old times, huh?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s been a while hasn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo;\nThanks to the big news about the plane incident, James had little to no time to get his own research going. He spent most of the morning brainstorming with other scientists about the new information brought by this incident. Thankfully it had been decided to compare the results while they were at it. James was understandably happy for the opportunity to get new input, since the information delivery had been sparse so far.\n\u0026ldquo;As you can see, the subjects DNA consists of a hundred chromosomes as opposed to the usual 46. It\u0026rsquo;s also been proven that the 46 original chromosomes remained unchanged. In short, the mutation basically consists of 54 additional chromosomes being added to the DNA via some kind of virus\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Prof. Harland was just reporting about things James was already aware off. \u0026ldquo;… that being said, I think it\u0026rsquo;s important to quarantine every person who have come in contact with one of these individuals to prevent further spreading of this effect.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think a quarantine would be necessary. The sample of vaginal fluids I examined yesterday indicated that it isn\u0026rsquo;t even sexually transferable. There was no sign of such a virus to be found although it was confirmed that the woman in question had this kind of mutation.\u0026rdquo; James interrupted. He already knew that the virus in question must be part of the potion that gave Michelle her powers.\nHarland\u0026rsquo;s face darkened as he heard that. \u0026ldquo;That doesn\u0026rsquo;t exclude the possibility of an infection through contact. What\u0026rsquo;s more we can\u0026rsquo;t afford to let possible infected run around freely \u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;If the mutation was as infectious as you claim to be, we\u0026rsquo;re already too late for quarantining them anyway. Ms. Riley works as a bank accountant, she has met hundreds of people by now that would\u0026rsquo;ve been infected as well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I agree with Dr. Thompson,\u0026rdquo; Prof. Smith interrupted. \u0026ldquo;If we start quarantining people now, it will turn into a second meteor scare in no time. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to mention what happens if people believe that these … superpowers could be contagious. We have to disprove this theory asap. Have everybody who gets in contact with these individuals get tested as a safety measure, but don\u0026rsquo;t quarantine them. Now what can you tell us about the sample you examined yesterday, Dr. Thompson?\u0026rdquo;\nJames gulped. He knew that his report bore some shocking news even though it contained no information about Michelle or Amanda.\n\u0026ldquo;Yesterday morning a man was found severely injured in a back alley. According to his injuries, it was theorized that they were due to a sexual encounter with a woman that was significantly stronger than him. The man is still in critical condition and the damage to his spine will probably leave him paralyzed. Since the police was already informed about the superpowered woman, they managed to secure a sample. Through this we found out that the woman in question had the same kind of mutation as Jane Doe.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wait a second,\u0026rdquo; a female scientist that James didn\u0026rsquo;t know interrupted. \u0026ldquo;If you say \u0026lsquo;significantly stronger\u0026rsquo; are you implying that the woman was as strong as the … Angel?\u0026amp;quot\nJames nodded. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it seems there\u0026rsquo;s a connection between the mutation and the superpowers.\u0026rdquo; He waited a bit for the shock to travel through the entire room. James was actually surprised about how many of the scientists had not considered the possibility of a connection. \u0026ldquo;Furthermore, this morning I ran a test that confirmed that the culprit in this case is neither the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; nor the redhead that was mentioned earlier, in fact the culprit is at least partial \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Asian, huh?\u0026rdquo; Detective Jacob Spencer commented on the email he had received from James Thompson earlier. \u0026ldquo;Well that kind of narrows it down.\u0026rdquo; Unfortunately it wasn\u0026rsquo;t half as much as he wanted it to be. He leaned back in his chair, trying to sort his thoughts. Last night’s events were all over the news, \u0026ldquo;An angel prevents a plane crash!\u0026rdquo; that\u0026rsquo;s how they call it. Fortunately the crash had happened in another city, taking the media\u0026rsquo;s attention along with it. But Jacob knew that this was only temporary. For several days now, this woman has been seen around town, helping people. Now these people would talk about how they had encountered this very woman. Damn, Jacob himself had a hard time not mentioning his encounter with her last night. It was only a matter of time till the media caught wind of it - if they hadn\u0026rsquo;t already. The fact that there were more than one of these women out there won\u0026rsquo;t stay a secret for much longer too. Jacob gulped at that thought. So far it had been possible that these women knew nothing about each other, but that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case anymore. Worst case scenario would be that this \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; was the only one unaware of the other\u0026rsquo;s. This was only speculation, though.\nLooking back at the mail, Jacob tried to put the pieces together as best he could. So far he knew about four different individuals that were affected - as James had put it - by this kind of mutation: The blonde \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo;, the redhead, the dead prostitute and the Asian who had fucked a man to the brink of death. Said man wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly a saint, so Jacob didn\u0026rsquo;t feel that bad about it. It looked like the prostitute was the odd one here considering she died while the others showed various cases of invulnerability. Jacob shook his head as he recalled the bullet\u0026rsquo;s bouncing of the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; without any effect - not to mention her simply catchin the shot he himself had fired at the wannabe rapist she had been facing. What was the reason behind the prostitute\u0026rsquo;s death? Were these powers indeed temporary or was it because of her drug history? No, the drug history being cleared out of her system had caused her to overdose her drugs.\nIf you look at it from this way, this meant that whatever caused the mutation was the best chance for the woman to quit the drugs. Her diary even mentioned that she was on the verge of beginning a new life when she made the mistake of taking the drugs again\u0026hellip; Maybe there was a reason behind it? Could someone have caused the mutation in order to give her this chance? The \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; perhaps?\nJacob took out the prostitutes diary once again. Now that he had a valid reason to believe that this woman had super powers at one point, it was painfully obvious to spot it. The strange dream about having the best night of her life pretty much screamed as such, especially since she even mentioned \u0026lsquo;feeling like she could fly\u0026rsquo; at one point. Jacob\u0026rsquo;s heart dropped as he realized that there was no mentioning of the \u0026lsquo;Angel\u0026rsquo; or any other woman in this passage. The only other person she described was a man - whom she described as simply unreal.\nThis wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly news to Jacob - he had read the last parts of the diary several times by now. But recent events made him look at this revelation in a new light. There was no doubt that the prostitute had sex with said man - that\u0026rsquo;s what she did for a living - and that this man had been gone by the next day. Unharmed. Not like the man that had the misfortune of encountering the Asian on such a level. This could mean one of three things: The prostitute could be weaker than the others -unlikely- , have more control over these powers during sex -unlikely since she just got them- or the man could have been super as well - probably the one who caused her mutation in the first place.\nWith a loud thud Jacob closed the diary. So far these superpowered women had been rather attractive, bringing up the possibility that their beauty was part of their powers. The prostitute herself had looked a lot better than expected, and the Angel had been downright stunning even in the dim light of a dark back alley. By this logic, it could be assumed that a man with similar powers would stick out as well. He closed his eyes as the revelation hit him. Two nights ago - probably mere hours before the Asian had encountered her victim, he had noticed a man that did stick out in such a way. It had been when he had talked to Erika Riley in a bar. The fact that she had been connected to both the Angel and the redhead had distracted him from most of what happened there at that time, but this had been stuck in the back of his head.\nBack then both Jacob and Erika had assumed that the awfully good-looking man was going for the paralyzed Asian girl instead of one of her friends because the others had probably hired him to do so. What if this guy had been this good-looking because he had superpowers? In that case it would be risky to have sex with a woman who wasn\u0026rsquo;t super as well, and giving her super powers would fix that. What\u0026rsquo;s more, if good looks were indeed part of the whole package, he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even need to have high standards for choosing his partner. In fact he could be deliberately choosing rather unappealing or even sick women - they would love him for the attention he gave them and eventually turn into women everybody would want to be with. Could it be that the frail, paralyzed Asian was the woman he was looking for?\nJacob cursed the fact that he hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen her face. Back then he had been sitting facing the other way and it had been Erika who had seen most of it. Without a second thought, he rose from his table and made his way towards the exit. It was far-fetched but this Asian woman was probably the best lead he had. And the best way to find her was with the help of Erika Riley.\nAmanda walked up the stairs of the apartment complex. She had rarely been to Erika\u0026rsquo;s place before and she was once again surprised at how subpar Erika lived. Fred\u0026rsquo;s sister clearly lived her life to its fullest. Considering that Amanda could afford a better place than this on her waitress' job alone, it became obvious that Erika had different priorities when it came to money. But Amanda had come to accept Erika\u0026rsquo;s lifestyle - even though she herself wouldn\u0026rsquo;t do it the same way. And right now, she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t really be in the position to scold the other woman to begin with. After all she had hospitalized her own boyfriend. It was a downright miracle that their relationship somehow recovered through all this.\nAfter knocking on the door, Amanda waited for a response - that didn\u0026rsquo;t come. Two minutes of waiting later she began to wonder if Erika was elsewhere and took out her phone. The distinct ringtone of Erika\u0026rsquo;s cellphone could be heard through the door – she was either at home or she had left the phone there. Amanda knocked the door again but there was no answer this time either. She then tried to open the door and was surprised that it hadn\u0026rsquo;t been locked in the first place. Hesitantly, she entered the apartment.\nErika\u0026rsquo;s flat was rather basic in appearance - just like the apartment complex it was part of. Not that it looked cheap or something, but the place really gave a more functional vibe than one would expect from a grown woman.\nLooking around further, Amanda soon found Erika lying on the floor. Her heart dropped for several reasons. The way Erika lay in front of her full-length mirror didn\u0026rsquo;t suggest that she had voluntarily chosen this position. What\u0026rsquo;s more was Erika\u0026rsquo;s outfit: A red jacked, a black skirt and matching black boots - the same outfit that the raven-haired attacker from last night had worn. The only difference was that the outfit Erika wore showed no sign of their battle. But as if to drive the point home, Amanda now spotted the original outfit scattered across the floor.Obviously it had been discarded to make room for the new outfit.\nSlowly, Amanda bent down, hoping to wake up the other woman, but an even bigger shock awaited her. Erika\u0026rsquo;s skin felt so cold, that Amanda\u0026rsquo;s immediate reaction of checking her pulse was merely wishful thinking. She realized that Erika had been clutching her chest in her last moments. A heart-attack? Why would someone of Erika\u0026rsquo;s age have a heart attack? Tears filled her eyes as she thought about it. Amanda didn\u0026rsquo;t have much time to cry, though. Suddenly she noticed a movement behind her, and when she turned around, all she could see through teary eyes was the barrel of a gun. Then she heard a man\u0026rsquo;s voice order her to \u0026ldquo;Freeze!\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part10/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 10"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"Fred stared at the open window of his hospital room as if he expected her. Amanda had silently watched his conversation with Erika, using her newfound super hearing to eavesdrop.\nBut Fred hadn\u0026rsquo;t hinted that he expected her to come, nor pretended to care that Erika forgot to close the window as she had left the room. After all, he wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to stand up and close it himself. Whatever the reason, Amanda took the opportunity to enter the room, once she was sure Erika was gone and Fred wouldn\u0026rsquo;t suspect her of having eavesdropped. It was dark outside and the hospital room was also very poorly lighted, but he seemed to notice her right away.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi.\u0026rdquo; she said, unsure of how to address her boyfriend. Right now she was her alter ego after all, a woman that should be a bit flirty with him, but not more. Especially considering the fact that she was the reason he was hospitalized in the first place.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey.\u0026rdquo; came the answer. Fred didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be in the best of moods – this much was obvious even without her already knowing the issue at hand. \u0026ldquo;Uhm, nice outfit.\u0026rdquo; he added nervously.\n\u0026ldquo;You like it?\u0026rdquo; Amanda teased, in fact she hadn\u0026rsquo;t come here to show off the prototype for her costume, but to find out what he was hiding from her. But right now it would be better to play along and divert his attention away from her goal – he might become too suspicious if she cut to the chase.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah sure,\u0026rdquo; Fred agreed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert when it comes to fashion, but this outfit is clearly intimidating.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Intimidating? I thought we were past this.\u0026rdquo; Amanda pouted.\n\u0026ldquo;What can I say? It\u0026rsquo;s dark and your eyes glow orange, it\u0026rsquo;s really hard not to be scared shitless right now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really? I wasn\u0026rsquo;t even aware that they glow.\u0026rdquo; Amanda finally touched the ground and strolled towards the bed. \u0026ldquo;I hope you don\u0026rsquo;t mind.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm, yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m trying my best.\u0026rdquo; Fred seemed really nervous now.\nAmanda pondered the reasons. Sure, their first encounter in her super form had been bad for his health but, after her apology, she didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to be this intimidating. Another possible reason could be the conversation he had had with Erika before. His sister had brought up the possibility that Amanda and Devil – that name was getting more appropriate by the second – were the same person. Fred had been a bit too convinced that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case, so Amanda feared that he actually suspected her.\n\u0026ldquo;So, how\u0026rsquo;s your knee doing?\u0026rdquo; Amanda asked while she obviously used her X-Ray vision to check for herself.\n\u0026ldquo;As you can see, not much different,\u0026rdquo; Fred exclaimed shortly.\nAmanda nodded, even though she thought otherwise. With her improved senses she could see the progress the healing process had made in the last two days. Even back then she was able to pick up that the process stopped as soon as she had shared her invulnerability with him. Still Fred wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to tell the difference, so Amanda refrained from mentioning it. After all she might slip into medical terms that would only give him a further hint at her identity – after all he knew about her failed attempt to become a doctor. Damn, the sheer implication that he might suspect her was making her nervous.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be in a good mood. Had some bad news?\u0026rdquo; Amanda thought she might as well cut to the chase.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, if you had to lie in the hospital all day, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be in a good mood by the evening as well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you have any visitors besides me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, of course, but not every visitor is good news, you know. The police for example changes their opinion of me on a daily basis. First they simply suspect me of covering up what happened to me – which was true. Then, when they learned the truth – sorry about that – they act all serious but the last guy who was here really had the most outrageous questions.\u0026rdquo;\nThis was new to Amanda – why hadn\u0026rsquo;t Fred mentioned this to her when she had been here earlier?\n\u0026ldquo;Outrageous questions? What kind of questions were those?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You really wanna know? They asked me about whether or not it was possible for you to have sex.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re kidding me, right?\u0026rdquo; Amanda could feel her cheeks taking on the same color as her fiery hair.\nFred shook his head. \u0026ldquo;I first thought it to be a joke as well, but this guy was serious. He said that it was about a case and this information could be the difference between accident and assault.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda gulped, her embarrassment quickly changing into concern. She knew that she hadn\u0026rsquo;t done anything that could be interpreted as a sex-accident. The only other person capable of something like that was Michelle and her date looked alive and well this morning. Not to mention that Michelle was pretty much the last person on Earth to do something like that. No, this could only mean\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;There are more like me out there\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she exclaimed, secretly proud that she hadn\u0026rsquo;t said \u0026ldquo;us\u0026rdquo; in this situation.\n\u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t know? There seems to be at least one out there that beat you to the whole superhero idea.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ha! I bet she doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a kickass costume like me!\u0026rdquo; Amanda said, knowing fully well that Michelle wasn\u0026rsquo;t that interested in finding a good costume in the first place.\n\u0026ldquo;At least she was there when my sister was in trouble,\u0026rdquo; Fred snarked. \u0026ldquo;You wasted one hell of an opportunity to make up for this.\u0026rdquo;\nThat comment felt like a slap to her face. Amanda had been so good at pretending to know nothing, she had even forgot to consider the fact that Erika had been saved by Michelle before.\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she stammered. \u0026ldquo;Did you really think I would go right to patrolling after what had happened to you? Because I didn\u0026rsquo;t think so!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You got a point there,\u0026rdquo; Fred sighted, before continuing. \u0026ldquo;Sorry, I overreacted a bit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s ok. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know that your sister could\u0026rsquo;ve used my help. What happened to her?\u0026rdquo; Amanda feigned interest, but the truth was she knew the story in and out already.\n\u0026ldquo;She volunteered to be a hostage during a bank robbery. As I said, the other supergirl dealt with it; scared the hell out of the robbers in the process.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why would she volunteer for that?\u0026rdquo; Amanda was curious, this part was indeed new to her.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got no idea.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re lying!\u0026rdquo; Amanda blurted out before she even realized how she knew that.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Super senses, remember? I can see and hear the little hints of a lie all over your body. The quickening heartbeat, the increasing amount of sweat, the slightest shake in your voice. You may be able to fool most people, but not me. You know exactly why your sister volunteered to be the hostage.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So what?\u0026rdquo; Fred looked still a bit dumbfounded, but he had clearly regained his composure. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re making a fuss because of a little lie but, at the same time, you fail to see the reason behind it: My sister\u0026rsquo;s none of your business. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to know why she does what, okay?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t you overreacting again? I was just proud to be able to tell a small lie like this right away and you blow up in my face because of this,\u0026rdquo; Amanda tried to disarm the situation. Talking about lies and secrets was naturally a tricky topic for him right now, but \u0026ldquo;Devil\u0026rdquo; didn\u0026rsquo;t know about that. She wondered if she could user her supposed lack of knowledge to cause Fred to make a slip of the tongue and reveal why he had cheated on her.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh yeah, now it\u0026rsquo;s my fault that you yell at me like a psycho.\u0026rdquo; Fred didn\u0026rsquo;t buckle down now and a part of Amanda was actually proud of him for this.\n\u0026ldquo;Look who\u0026rsquo;s talking. First you blame me for not being there when your sister was in trouble – even though you said yourself that everything turned out fine. And when I ask what happened, you lie to me. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk about it, just say so. It\u0026rsquo;s better than being lied to.\u0026rdquo; Amanda did her best not to smile wickedly on the idea that she used Fred\u0026rsquo;s very own arguing against him.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright I get it,\u0026rdquo; Fred admitted, looking away from her.\nAfter a few seconds it became clear that he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t continue, so Amanda took the initiative. \u0026ldquo;About your offer the other day, did you really intend to sell that car of yours?\u0026rdquo;\nFred turned back towards her with a shocked expression, a hint of anger in his eyes. Amanda rewarded his defiant look by sticking out her tongue a bit. Yeah, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to lie yourself out of this one.\nIt took a few seconds until he let out a sigh. \u0026ldquo;Okay, you got me here, I didn\u0026rsquo;t intent to sell it. But since I can\u0026rsquo;t afford to repair it, I thought that would be the best idea.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda nodded in agreement. \u0026ldquo;Too bad I can\u0026rsquo;t afford to buy it right now. I wish I could at least repay you some of the damage.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t mind that.\u0026rdquo; Fred waved his hand dismissively. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;re more important things than a car.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Amanda said while she involuntarily smiled. Fred was obviously referring to their recent make-up. Then she got an idea. \u0026ldquo;So how should I repay you then? Last time you mentioned something about you breaking up, right? How about I take care of this?\u0026rdquo;\nFred\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened as he heard that. \u0026ldquo;W-what are you implying?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Amanda answered, still smiling wickedly. \u0026ldquo;You sure have something that you\u0026rsquo;d like me to do?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As a matter of fact I don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Fred gulped and his voice became shaky.\nWith her improved hearing, Amanda could pick up how her boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s heart began beating faster and faster as a clear sign of his nervousness. She even noticed the slight layer of sweat forming on his forehead. Amanda enjoyed the effect she had on him and decided to tease him further.\n\u0026ldquo;Why not? You said you broke up, right? I could try to give a good word for you with her or maybe I could… take over.\u0026rdquo; Amanda\u0026rsquo;s smile had turned into a seductive grin as she said that, coming ever closer to his face.\n\u0026ldquo;W-We are back together,\u0026rdquo; Fred tried to increase the distance by pressing his head into the pillow behind – with limited success. \u0026ldquo;So you see, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing you need to do\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good for you,\u0026rdquo; Amanda giggled, \u0026ldquo;But it seems like you may still want to know the answer to an earlier question about what I can do.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, seriously don\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Fred was panicking at these implications – obviously aware that he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to resist her physically – or mentally.\nHis resistance actually surprised Amanda. Fred had cheated on her before, so she expected him to warm up to the idea of doing so again. \u0026ldquo;Come on,\u0026rdquo; she whispered. \u0026ldquo;I can clearly see that a part of you wants to take up my offer.\u0026rdquo;\nFred closed his eyes, trying to collect himself. \u0026ldquo;S-Stop it. We just got back together\u0026hellip; this would be a mistake.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda reached out with her hand and slowly caressed his face. Fred visibly tensed up upon her touch. \u0026ldquo;You really love her, huh?\u0026rdquo; Amanda\u0026rsquo;s expression softened as she said that, the fact that her boyfriend would still prefer her to a superpowered version of herself made her feel much more comfortable than the sight of Fred struggling against her.\nFred opened his eyes and nodded.\nThe two of them looked into each other\u0026rsquo;s eye\u0026rsquo;s for some time. Amanda noticed how Fred seemed to calm down a bit, the signs of panic disappearing leaving him merely on edge. The superpowered redhead on the other hand felt herself getting… aroused? Her body obviously didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the fact that Fred didn\u0026rsquo;t know who she really was.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you… sweating?\u0026rdquo; Fred eventually asked, surprised.\n\u0026ldquo;Seems like it. Not that it would be a surprise.\u0026rdquo; In fact, Amanda was rather alarmed by this development. Earlier she had run in her normal form at top speed from here to her apartment without breaking a single drop of sweat, now she could feel herself beginning to perspire even though she was in her super form now not to mention far from exerting herself. At least it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel uncomfortable, and Amanda was actually enjoying it along with her increasing … oh my god.\nAmanda took a closer look at Fred and realized that it was just as she feared. His eyes looked a bit dazed, his breathing got deeper and his heartbeat quickened again.\n\u0026ldquo;What the …? Wow you smell good,\u0026rdquo; he exclaimed as if to confirm it.\nIt was obvious now, Amanda hadn\u0026rsquo;t begun to sweat because of exhaustion or nervousness, but because of her arousal. And her sweat was laden with pheromones … super pheromones. Unfortunately, she realized this one moment to late. Before she knew it, she leaned over to kiss him.\nThere was no resistance this time. Entranced by her super pheromones, Fred answered her kiss with the same passion she displayed. Amanda couldn\u0026rsquo;t blame him for giving in as she couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop herself either. Somewhere in the back of her head her rational side was screaming to her that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing him a favor, trying to remind her why she had pulled back just a few moments earlier. But this part had no say in the manner. Right now a primal urge began to dominate her thoughts, an urge that didn\u0026rsquo;t care about the lies that come with a secret identity. She hovered above him while their lips were still locked onto each other, slowly disintegrating her costume as she began to remove his hospital gown.\nJacob Spencer strolled through the streets trying to clear his head. It seemed that, with every day, a new piece of outrageous news would arrive, forcing him to rethink his whole concept of reality. The news about superpowered women – as unbelievable as they were – had started out quite positively. Unfortunately each passing day seemed to increase their number – and not in a good way. First a blonde that played the role of a superhero, then a redhead that seemed a bit troublesome, but ultimately helpful – if only as a source of information. After all her accident had let her to inform the victim a bit about what she can do – namely to temporary share her powers with others. This turned out to be one vital piece of information considering the newest find: a severely injured man who – of this Jacob was certain by now – had been raped by a woman of comparable power. Jacob sighed, there was a clear pattern here and he didn\u0026rsquo;t like its direction.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t make a noise if you want to live, bitch!\u0026rdquo; a male voice hissed from a side-road.\nJacob went by the side-road with the same speed as he spotted, through the corner of his eyes, a man leaning over a woman, cornering her against the wall. From the way he held his arm, Jacob figured he was wielding a knife, but his opportunity to look was only short – and right now the masquerade that he was just a random passersby took priority over that. Once he had passed the opening of the street, Jacob counted the number of steps he made, slowly switching to sneaking before eventually turning around. Mentally preparing himself for the action that was about to happen, he reached for his gun and approached the corner he had passed. Just as Jacob was about to reach it, he could hear a loud gunshot coming out of it.\nDamn, he thought. So it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a knife but a gun. Jacob approached the corner with even more care now, wondering if he had been spotted and the gun would be pointed at him as soon as he looked around the corner. Another gunshot. And one more. Realizing that they weren\u0026rsquo;t fired in his direction, Jacob rushed around the corner and aimed his gun ready to fire at once – but what he saw was different from what he expected. The man stood there, his hand shaking – not from the shots he had fired just now – but from witnessing their utter lack of damage. Jacob recognized the reason immediately: it was the blonde superwoman he had seen on a video made by a surveillance camera two days ago. She stood between the man and his victim and had obviously taken the opportunity to display her invulnerability.\nThis was truly a sight to behold. The black leotard seemed made specifically for her body, showing of her unreal curves. For some reason, that Jacob couldn\u0026rsquo;t put his finger on, this outfit inspired awe more than lust. Even in the darkness of the street this woman seemed to radiate an inner light. At the same time she also gave off a caring aura, an unspoken promise that everything could be fine as long as she was there. Yes, her outfit was meant to be practical, not to show off how far beyond mere mortals she was – that was either a bonus or a necessary evil. It took all of Jacob’s willpower not to waste precious time staring at her magnificent body in this situation.\n\u0026ldquo;W-what are you?\u0026rdquo; the man cried out as the blonde approached him steadily. He was even unable to try for another shot before she reached for his gun and took it away. Jacob could hear a metallic groaning as the gun deformed under her grip. The man snapped, taking out a knife with his other hands and tried to stab the blonde.\nEven though Jacob knew that the blonde would laugh off a knife as much as she had the gunshots, his instincts kicked in and he fired at the culprit\u0026rsquo;s hand, hoping to disarm him with one shot. Jacob was a pretty good shooter, so he was all the more surprised to see that he had missed the guy entirely.\nThe blonde, on the other hand, didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to bother much with the knife, catching it with her bare hand, then squeezing it similar to how she had squeezed the gun – deforming it to the point of uselessness as well. With a loud clang, the knife fell to the ground, now Jacob realized that the gun was also lying there – when had she dropped it? Jacob was still asking himself this – as the blonde goddess had decided to go into the offensive for once, shoving her enemy in a leisurely way … across the street where he slammed into the wall and sank down – unconscious.\nJacob stared at the results of the battle with awe. He had seen this woman take down armed enemies over and over again, but seeing it with his own eyes was a totally different thing. It took him a while to realize that she had shifted her attention to him. Her blue eyes clearly visible in the dark as she held up her hand to reveal a bullet. \u0026ldquo;Want it back?\u0026rdquo;\nJacob\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened as he realized that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t one of the bullets that the other man had fired at this blonde goddess, but the one he himself had fired at him. She caught it right out of the air and I didn\u0026rsquo;t even see it! Now he noticed that he was still pointing his gun at her, and that she didn\u0026rsquo;t know that he was a cop! He hastily lowered his gun in order not to provoke any hostility.\n\u0026ldquo;No need to be scared, Detective. I saw from the trajectory of your shot that you were aiming at his hand, but I thought that this kind of injury was a bit over the top for him.\u0026rdquo; She gestured towards the unconscious man.\n\u0026ldquo;How did you know that I was …\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;X-Ray vision,\u0026rdquo; she interrupted. \u0026ldquo;I can see your badge even when you\u0026rsquo;re not presenting it.\u0026rdquo; She then turned to the woman she had just saved. \u0026ldquo;This man\u0026rsquo;s a police detective, he will take care of you.\u0026rdquo;\nThe goddess suddenly started to rise off the floor. Jacob had seen this one on the video as well, but just like the rest, seeing the real deal left him awestruck for too long to even form a single question. And there were many things this woman could\u0026rsquo;ve answered for him.\nHigh above the skyline, Michelle came to a halt. The blonde woman let out a relieved sigh, knowing that nobody would hear her there. Three times the mugger had shot her, twice he had hit her breasts. It had taken all her willpower not to show how pleasurable these gunshots had been. Normally this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been that big of an issue, but Michelle had decided to supercharge her senses during the whole situation. This had given her the reaction necessary to catch a bullet out of the air, but it had also increased the sensation when she had been hit. Allowing her senses to tune down on merely faster than human level, she scanned the city for the next thing to do. After all, she was brimming with power right now. Michelle had followed her boyfriend’s advice and drunk multiple doses of the potion before going out on patrol, so she had more than enough to spare right now and since she had only stopped little crimes so far, she yearned for a bigger challenge. The young woman was aware that, due to the existence of other superpowered people out there, this bigger challenge would come sooner or later. The question was whether or not she would be prepared when the time came.\nWhat was even worse was that her ability to see the super energy didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to mix well with her other forms of super sight. She had found Amanda earlier without a problem but, even though her best friend was in her super form, Michelle wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to make out this particular energy inside her friend at this distance. Michelle had refrained from testing out these limits in order not to disturb her privacy – after all Amanda had been talking to her boyfriend at that time. Long story short, even though she had the advantage of being able to see whether someone was super at first sight, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t put this ability to good use by scanning the city from above.\nFinding no other indication about a crime she could stop, Michelle wondered what to do next. Go back to the mountains to train her powers? Look at another city to see if she can be of use there? Fly around the world just for the heck of it? This sounded like a good idea, after all her flight powers were the most versatile and should receive priority when it comes to being mastered. Without any further thought she began flying eastward. Training her flight power not only was a priority to her because of its versatility, but also because she simply enjoyed using it. She screamed in joy as the wind tugged at her body, while she pushed herself ever closer to the speed of sound and, with a loud boom, she went beyond.\nAn awkward silence ruled the small hospital room for a long time after Amanda and Fred had finished their act. They were both lying under the covers of the small hospital bed, with Amanda lying on top of her clueless boyfriend. Even though their heads were right next to each other, they looked in opposite directions. They both had cleared their heads again and with this the gravity of this situation came crashing down on them.\n\u0026ldquo;This … was a big mistake,\u0026rdquo; Fred eventually said.\nAmanda couldn\u0026rsquo;t disagree, but at the same time it felt bad to hear it. To her, it had just been making love with her boyfriend, but for him it bordered on rape. The fact that she had been just as entranced as he, did little to comfort her.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any better words. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know what came over me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This really puts me into a difficult situation.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know. I already said I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t sound like it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s mean, I only wanted to help. And besides you didn\u0026rsquo;t look like you didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy it.\u0026rdquo; Amanda retorted. \u0026ldquo;I said before that these powers are new to me and so are these … urges. You just got caught up in them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This is one way to put it. Another would be your talent for screwing up whenever you have to adapt to something unexpected.\u0026rdquo;\nEven though Fred\u0026rsquo;s voice sounded more joking than threatening, Amanda clearly felt a sense of dread.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; she asked, now turning to face him and seeing that he was looking at her as well.\n\u0026ldquo;We should drop this farce, don\u0026rsquo;t you think?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda\u0026rsquo;s eyes widened. \u0026ldquo;How did you\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My phone. After you dropped me, you used it to call the ambulance, but you made the mistake of calling your best friend right afterward. I noticed it later, when I decided to call you after your visit here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You knew it that long? Why … why didn\u0026rsquo;t you say so?\u0026rdquo; Amanda was feeling her face becoming red considering the stupid mistake she had made two days ago.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you really have to ask? There\u0026rsquo;s something I don\u0026rsquo;t want you to know, so I ignored anything that hinted towards your identity. But after this, I can\u0026rsquo;t pretend that you\u0026rsquo;re someone else.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, it sure makes things easier. I\u0026rsquo;m not a good liar after all.\u0026rdquo;\nThe awkwardness had evaporated, and the mood had turned to what it should\u0026rsquo;ve been like from the beginning: Two lovers lying next to each other, locked into each other’s gaze.\n\u0026ldquo;So\u0026hellip; I take it you want to know what exactly happened to me,\u0026rdquo; Amanda began.\n\u0026ldquo;Actually I think it\u0026rsquo;s better that you keep the details to yourself. As I said, there\u0026rsquo;s still something that I want to keep for me, so it would only be fair if you did the same.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously? You learn that your girlfriend has superpowers, but you still want to keep it to yourself? What can be so important that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even tell me about it? Don\u0026rsquo;t you have any trust in your girlfriend?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course I do, but … trust me when I say I\u0026rsquo;ve got my reasons. But can you honestly say that you being responsible for my condition did not play its part in us getting back together?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t deny that I felt guilty about hurting you. But trust me when I say it\u0026rsquo;s not the reason I got back together with you. I still love you and honestly I felt flattered when you fought for me despite the odds being against you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a relief. But why did you confront me in this form at all? You should\u0026rsquo;ve known that you\u0026rsquo;d end up being the prime suspect if you come over to trash my car.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda went silent for a second. For days she had asked herself the same thing, yet the answer somehow had escaped her. \u0026ldquo;To be honest, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really have a plan back then. I just enjoyed my new powers, flew over the city and when I spotted you, I simply came over. It\u0026rsquo;s funny, even though I had been royally pissed at you the whole time before, somehow I just wanted to meet you again. Now that I think about it, maybe my feelings for you were much stronger than I expected – or wanted to admit at that moment. I always thought that cheating on me would be a deal breaker, but look at me, I\u0026rsquo;m more interested in the reasons behind it than in the fact itself\u0026hellip; that sounds weird, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed it does. But it sounds awfully like you to make strange decisions, if you didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to think things through beforehand. It\u0026rsquo;s just my luck to have you even though I don\u0026rsquo;t deserve you.\u0026rdquo; He reached out to kiss her – for the first time this evening – and Amanda happily complied.\nFor the first time in days, Amanda really felt connected to her boyfriend and at the same time felt herself beginning to sweat again. \u0026ldquo;Ready for round two?\u0026rdquo; she teased.\nMichelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe it as she approached the west coast, not even an hour had passed and she was already at the last end of her trip around the world. She had taken this opportunity to test her maximum speed – unfortunately she had no idea how fast that was, but being able to fly around the world in an hour surely spoke for itself. Michelle was actually surprised that there WAS a maximum speed at all. So far she had considered that she could just go faster and faster as long as her energy supply allowed it, but this time she had finally found the limit her body was capable of. With her increased energy supply, Michelle had developed a certain feeling for flying at her top speed and learned that she became slightly more efficient the longer she did so.\nJust as she began pondering whether she should set out for another lap at top speed, the blonde woman spotted a cloud of black smoke. In the darkness of night, this was quite a feat – after all every cloud was bound to appear as black. Within milliseconds Michelle had discovered the source of this cloud: An airplane, or more precisely one of its engines, that was clearly malfunctioning.\nMichelle immediately changed her course. She had already cleared half the distance to the plane before she even realized how serious this situation was. If this plane was about to crash, she was probably the only hope for its passengers – and now that she was aware of that, the survival of every passenger became top priority. Not wanting to waste even a single second, Michelle activated her super senses to their fullest. Instantly, the world around her seemed to slow down to an almost complete halt. Using her X-Ray vision, she counted 203 people on board even before assessing the damage to the engine. Of course Michelle lacked the necessary know-how to even consider repairing it, but her improved senses made her aware that the other engine was running in danger of failing as well. The crew had already begun preparations for an emergency landing as they tried to control the planes' unavoidable descent.\nWhile Michelle was still trying to figure out if and how she could be of help, a loud bang (at least that\u0026rsquo;s how it sounded to her) made her aware that her time was running short. The second engine was failing, spewing black smoke in the air in the process. The plane answered by a sudden drop in height and with her heightened senses, Michelle watched how every person on it became aware how serious things were. The flight crew struggled to keep the passengers calm, to avoid a panic. And even though the passengers kept their calm on the outside, Michelle was painfully aware of the fear they felt, a fear that was about to grip her as well even though she wasn\u0026rsquo;t the one in danger here.\nShaking her head, Michelle tried to get herself focused on the task at hand: How to keep the plane from crashing. Repairing the engines was out of question, even though her improved senses made it easy for her to determine what was broken, she lacked both the skill and the spare parts to do something about it – not to mention time. The only obvious solution was to lift the plane by herself which sounded much easier said than done. So far the heavy objects Michelle had carried were massive boulders that couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly collapse under their own weight. A plane, on the other hand, was a much more complex construction, far too big for a small person like her to lift. And that wasn\u0026rsquo;t even considering the fact that she would need an insane amount of strength to do so.\nBy the time she had thought that, Michelle was already underneath the plane, searching for a place that might actually allow her to get a hold. But wherever she looked, the metal plates seemed too fragile to actually hold the planes' weight. Damn, she thought. There had to be a place for her to lift the plane without destroying it. Her mind raced – and considering her activated heightened senses this really meant something. Even though her knowledge about the physics involved was average at best, her intelligence made up for it and the answer popped up in her head. She needed to somehow increase the area over which to apply the necessary pressure to lift the plane. Fortunately every plane had a designated place where upward forces were supposed to attack: The wings. Michelle\u0026rsquo;s head turned left and right. With both engines out, she would need to lift on both sides simultaneously – but how? Even with her 6'3\u0026quot; body her arms weren\u0026rsquo;t long enough for this – wait a second.\nMichelle\u0026rsquo;s blue eyes widened as she thought of the answer. Looking once more at both sides, she made sure that she was in the center of the plane right between the wings. Then she looked forward and downward, seeing the ground approaching steadily – she still had a bit time, but she needed to hurry. With a though, she expanded her costume from behind herself, forcing the strange substance that was part of her body to run along the underside of the plane and fill the underside of its wings. The idea was pretty simple. After all, the super power she needed to lift something while flying was not her strength but her flight ability. In other words she didn\u0026rsquo;t need her muscles to apply pressure but applying her super energy to her costume would do the trick.\nNow that the problem with the way to apply the necessary force was dealt with, another more pressing problem came back to Michelle: her own limits. While she had been capable of lifting heavy rocks, she had already felt her energy consumption increase significantly when she did so. Not to mention, that she had just recently learned that there was a maximum amount of flight energy she could use at a time. It was entirely possible that she was simply too weak to lift the plane. Shaking her head Michelle abandoned this thought. Don\u0026rsquo;t even think about failing, there are lives depending on you! With this thought, she began to set her plan in motion and increased the amount of flight energy she used and channeled it through her – for the lack of a better word – wings. As she steadily increased the force with which she pushed against the wings, Michelle soon felt the limit of what she could do approaching. The entire plane groaned as the young woman\u0026rsquo;s effort slowed down its descent.\nAll too soon Michelle was pushing with full force while realizing that the descent was slowing, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t slow enough for a safe landing. Michelle\u0026rsquo;s heart dropped, but she refused to accept this. Concentrating harder she tried to squeeze out as much flight energy as possible. She went through the basics once again in her head. Each cell in her body was involved when it came to using her flight powers, but there were indeed cells that weren\u0026rsquo;t active at this time. Right. A certain amount of muscle cells were still dormant, only meant to awaken if the necessary muscle mass was needed. Intuitively Michelle awakened these cells to add to the amount of super energy she was converting to flight energy at this moment. She didn\u0026rsquo;t grow the extra muscle mass, though, but instead forced these cells to concentrate on this one task – not even sure how she commanded single cells to do her bidding. Right now she was just happy that it worked and the descent slowed down even further. Using every cell in her body Michelle urged her body to increase the output even further. Unfortunately it seemed that her costume was only able to use apply the flight energy, not generate it like the rest of her body. The feeling of being at her limit was similar to what she knew from her \u0026lsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; limits.\nAs she pushed herself beyond her limit, Michelle felt a sensation, she thought impossible in her super form: Pain. It began slowly at first, but with her super senses active it felt several leagues worse. Her body was scolding her for going beyond her limits and, slowly but surely, this scolding became a loud scream that urged her to stop this madness. But Michelle wouldn\u0026rsquo;t stop. Too clear she remembered the scared faces of the people whose lives she just shouldered. And her stubbornness was rewarded. Along with her pain, the amount of flight powers she generated increased. The incredible amount of energy caused her \u0026lsquo;wings\u0026rsquo; to start glowing slightly, but Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t notice about that fact. Her eyes remained focused on the ever-approaching ground and the ever-slowing speed with which it drew closer. Their descent had reached a tolerable speed, but Michelle had little time to be happy about her success. After all, she used up a tremendous amount of her super energy and noticed that her supply would reach its end soon. She was glad that she had drunk the extra doses before going on patrol; otherwise she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even have been able to try anything here. Still, it was going to be a very close call, from what she could tell Michelle would transform back to normal right before they reached the ground.\nRealizing that her current actions would result in a fall without being invulnerable seemed to intensify her body\u0026rsquo;s urge to stop what she was doing. Her survival instincts clashed with her plan to save these people and her thoughts raced to find a solution for this dilemma. There was only one possibility for her: Two days ago Michelle had noticed how her control over her powers had increased, resulting her using her energy more efficiently. If she could just increase her control a little bit, her supply would suffice for a safe landing. Somehow the fear inside her began to subside, as if her instincts were accepting the plan she had come up with. Michelle focused on how she was converting the super energy to flight energy. While first she had only cared about converting as much super energy as possible, she now found the time to actually tweak the process, to understand it a bit further. About two minutes had passed since she began pushing against the plane, but to Michelle this short timeframe felt like an eternity already. This was mainly because she was using her super senses through all of this. And, while the pain of her efforts felt much more intense this way, it also allowed her to gain a deeper insight on what she was doing there.\nMichelle was so focused; she barely noticed the ground coming ever nearer. She vaguely recognized the fact that it was an open space and there was a long and broad road that sufficed for the plane. What she didn\u0026rsquo;t realize was that she was landing the plane on an airport, and that there was already an emergency crew dispatched.\nA shock brought her out of her trance as the plane touched the ground. It took her a whole second to recognize this fact as she heard … clapping? Screaming – not of fear or pain, but of joy. Michelle turned around to find the source of these sounds – and found the passengers on the plane celebrating their survival. She had done it! Michelle allowed herself to descend as well, disintegrating the now useless \u0026lsquo;wings\u0026rsquo; she had created in the process. Landing on the ground, she could feel the pain from her exertion begin to dissipate as she allowed her senses to return to normal. The young woman was still a bit dazed as she recovered, her heartbeat bursting with pride at what she had achieved. She looked around. There was already quite a crowd – mostly the emergency team that was supposed to help evacuating the plane – and her presence hadn\u0026rsquo;t gone unnoticed. She could already see a few of them picking up their phones or even dedicated camera\u0026rsquo;s to take a picture of her\u0026hellip;\nWithout a second thought Michelle took back to the sky, her body hadn\u0026rsquo;t even finished recovering as the pain from earlier came back with full force. She didn\u0026rsquo;t care, her head was spinning and her energy supply was nearing its end. Gritting her teeth, the blonde woman headed straight back to her apartment.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part09/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 09"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"Erika finished her drink while she calmly looked around the bar. Since it was Monday there weren\u0026rsquo;t many people there, making it harder for her to find a man to… relieve some stress.\nSurprisingly, this wasn\u0026rsquo;t what had kept her from finding one. Yet, the real reason was sitting in another booth looking in her direction while at the same time trying not to be obvious about it. Normally Erika would have interpreted this behavior as interest in her, and subsequently start flirting with him. But Erika had already tried that yesterday, when he had questioned her about her role as a hostage in a bank robbery. And since this cop had already rejected her advances, his continuous peeking could only mean he tailed her. Was he still suspicious that she was somehow involved in the robbery? No, it must\u0026rsquo;ve been because of her encounter with this strange woman that had saved her. Eventually, Erika made the \u0026lsquo;I see you\u0026rsquo; gesture which prompted the man to stand up and approach her.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you think it would be better if you\u0026rsquo;d let someone that I don\u0026rsquo;t recognize tail me, Detective Spencer?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got no idea what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about,\u0026rdquo; he said with a smile. \u0026ldquo;By the way, call me Jacob. I\u0026rsquo;m off-duty right now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t deny that you\u0026rsquo;re tailing me, Jacob.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I highly doubt that you would believe me if I did. It was a coincidence that I met you here, but once I spotted you, well \u0026lsquo;guilty as charged\u0026rsquo;. That blonde friend of yours earlier seemed like you-know-who at first glance.\u0026rdquo;\nErika burst into laughter. \u0026ldquo;Amanda? She\u0026rsquo;s about a foot smaller than you-know-who, not to mention far more down-to-earth.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As I said: At first glance. She didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be in the best of moods there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh really? I think she did pretty well considering the recent events in her life.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What kind of events do you mean?\u0026rdquo; the tone of Jacob\u0026rsquo;s voice made it clear that he already knew - or suspected - a few of these.\n\u0026ldquo;Well her boyfriend - my brother - is lying in the hospital thanks to this redheaded bitch.\u0026rdquo; Erika purposely didn\u0026rsquo;t mention the short break-up Amanda and Fred had gone through.\n\u0026ldquo;Redheaded bitch?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t your scientist friend fill you in on this? It seems like there\u0026rsquo;s more than one woman flying around. My brother ruined his knee when this bitch let him fall.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thompson? I knew he visited your brother, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t call me afterwards. Must\u0026rsquo;ve been too busy preparing for his big date.\u0026rdquo; Jacob chuckled, but Erika noticed that it was forced.\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of which, is there any news about blondie?\u0026rdquo;\nJacob shrugged. \u0026ldquo;She stopped a few muggings from what I\u0026rsquo;ve heard, but nothing big.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of bi … look at that hunk.\u0026rdquo; Erika gestured at a man she had spotted.\nShe had been looking around the bar during the whole conversation, so she had noticed the newcomer almost immediately. He was at least 6'6\u0026quot; tall and quite muscular.This guy was a bit too good-looking for her to consider, since it provoked far too much competition. Sure enough, he was soon standing in the middle of an all-female group, burdened with the sadistic task of having to choose. To Erika\u0026rsquo;s surprise he clearly chose the weakest member of the group - a small, frail Asian girl in a wheelchair.\n\u0026ldquo;What a Cinderella story. I bet ten bucks that he was hired by the others so that the paralyzed girl had some fun.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Probably,\u0026rdquo; Erika nodded. It became painfully obvious which of the women were true friends of the Asian and who wasn\u0026rsquo;t. One group was talking to him with a more concerned expression, they obviously didn\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of leaving their friend alone with a stranger. The other group was trying to prevent that from happening by - unsuccessfully - flirting with him. Eventually he moved her out of the bar in her wheelchair.\n\u0026ldquo;If he\u0026rsquo;s really hired, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that be illegal?\u0026rdquo; Erika asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve seen much more dubious things that are legal today. For example the cost-to-success-ratio a certain Prof. Christopher Harland has with his attempts to cure this Harland-Syndrome that was named after him. Nine out of ten of his patients didn\u0026rsquo;t survive his treatment and they have to pay a ridiculous amount for it.\u0026rdquo;\nErika\u0026rsquo;s expression darkened. \u0026ldquo;Way to kill the mood. I\u0026rsquo;m talking enough about money at work\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nAs the first rays of light shone through the window, James opened his eyes and realized that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t in his own room. For a second he was confused, but when he spotted the brunette head of hair resting on his chest, everything came back to him. Last night he had a date with Michelle Jenkins, the woman whose bed he was lying in - and whose naked body was lying on top of his. He hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected for things to go this fast. Michelle had seemed to be the kind of woman who would wait for at least one more date - and James had been convinced she was worth waiting for. One might say that he got lucky, but the truth was that he had hit the jackpot. From the moment their lips had met yesterday, their bodies had moved on auto-pilot. James smiled as he recalled himself carrying Michelle upstairs to her apartment, a ridiculously dangerous feat, but Michelle\u0026rsquo;s body had proven to be so light that he had succeeded without problem. This must\u0026rsquo;ve been where the saying \u0026lsquo;love gives you wings\u0026rsquo; applied, even though the explanation was probably much more mundane. He most likely ignored the strain on his body due to an adrenaline rush, not only when he carried her upstairs, but also during the whole act that followed. To his surprise, Michelle seemed to be much stronger than her petite body implied - the same juxtaposition that someone with such a sweet and nice personality had such passion in bed. Beware the nice ones indeed. Not that James would complain about that. From his perspective the last night had been the best of his entire life - their lovemaking had been out of this world. It was as if both of them knew exactly what the other wanted. There had been no spoken word, no clear gesture, but for some reason whatever he did seemed to be just the thing Michelle had wished him to do at that moment, while she in turn would do exactly what he was fantasizing about in that very moment. James had no reasonable explanation for this effect, but truth be told, he didn\u0026rsquo;t care. All he cared about was lying right on top of him.\nJames reached and brushed her hair away, so that he could see her face. He was extra careful not to wake her up as he marveled at the cuteness of her sleeping face. Her eyes were closed and her lips showed a slight smile as she rested on his chest. Ever since he had first met her, Michelle seemed to amaze him with her beauty whenever they met, and this time was no exception. Only this time he could savor her beauty without his speechlessness making him appear like a dumbfounded schoolboy. What had he done for him to wake up next to such a woman? Was he even worthy of breathing the same air as her? Not to mention air that carried her scent? To watch this beautiful face with lips begging to be kissed. For a second James pondered leaning forward and stealing a kiss from the sleeping angel. But before he could even lean forward, Michelle\u0026rsquo;s face seemed to shoot into his direction. All James could do was open his mouth in time before her tongue entered it. Like last night, he had an idea that she had promptly set into motion. Suddenly he was aware that Michelle had only pretended to be asleep, being awake for about the same time as he was. As mysterious as this sudden insight was, as little did James care about it right now. Their kiss lasted for a minute.\n\u0026ldquo;Morning,\u0026rdquo; both Michelle and James said in unison, and burst into laughter because of it.\n\u0026ldquo;So\u0026hellip; uhm,\u0026rdquo; Michelle seemed a bit lost. \u0026ldquo;To be honest, this is kind of a first time to me.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat? James couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe the idea that Michelle might have been a virgin before.\n\u0026ldquo;No, I mean this is the first time I woke up next to somebody else. How do we continue from here?\u0026rdquo;\nNow that she mentioned it, James was no expert on this front, either.\n\u0026ldquo;Things moved much faster than I anticipated. But if there\u0026rsquo;s one thing I know it\u0026rsquo;s that I don\u0026rsquo;t want it to end here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Neither do I,\u0026rdquo; Michelle said, her brown eyes focused on his. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s strange, even though we met just two days ago \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;… it feels like we\u0026rsquo;ve always known each other,\u0026rdquo; James finished the sentence.\nMichelle looked surprised at first, but her expression became all the happier over the course of two seconds. For the fragment of a second, her eyes looked sideways to her nightstand.\nJames followed her short look and saw this strange plant standing there. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t really surprising for him not to know this particular plant as plants weren\u0026rsquo;t his specialty, but somehow it still seemed weird.\n\u0026ldquo;What kind of plant is this?\u0026rdquo; James asked.\nA wave of concern washed over Michelle\u0026rsquo;s face. She seemed to regret looking at the plant and causing this topic to come up. She took a few seconds before answering.\n\u0026ldquo;To be honest, I\u0026rsquo;ve got no idea. Just found the seed on the sidewalk and planted it. I\u0026rsquo;ve grown kind of attached to it.\u0026rdquo;\nJames left it at that.\n\u0026ldquo;Although\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Michelle took another sideway glance at the plant. A naughty smile formed on her face, but it turned into disappointment as she took a look at the clock next to the plant. It took no genius to figure out the reason.\n\u0026ldquo;Time for work?\u0026rdquo; James realized he shared her disappointment.\n\u0026ldquo;At least not enough time for what I had in mind. Seems like it\u0026rsquo;ll have to wait.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And when will that be?\u0026rdquo; James almost pleaded. The idea that the two of them had to separate was even more terrifying than it was last night.\n\u0026ldquo;That depends,\u0026rdquo; Michelle teased. \u0026ldquo;When are you free?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I could be here at six.\u0026rdquo; Of course he meant tonight.\n\u0026ldquo;Good, it\u0026rsquo;ll be a long night,\u0026rdquo; Michelle whispered.\nOh boy, she really knows how to tease.\n\u0026ldquo;I see it\u0026rsquo;ll be hard to concentrate on work today. I\u0026rsquo;ll spend all day missing you.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle smiled and kissed him again. She then grabbed a single hair of hers, ripped it out and presented it to James.\n\u0026ldquo;This should help you at work. After all you won\u0026rsquo;t miss me if you carry a part of me with you, right?\u0026rdquo;\nSomething told James that this was more than just a silly romantic gesture.\nIn the end, it was James who had to leave early in order to get a change of clothes before work. Once he was gone, Michelle fell back on her bed, reminiscing their date and its outcome. Besides this one situation where both of them were a bit nervous about each other, everything went borderline perfect. With a big smile she remembered their passionate lovemaking and began wondering how things would develop from here. She loved him, and she knew he loved her back, but there was also the part of her not being exactly normal. The way she seemed to be able to read his mind was one definite clue about that, and strangely, she hadn\u0026rsquo;t been in her super form when it happened. This was disturbing. Michelle had been aware that the changes the potion had done to her body were quite deep-rooted, but she hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected to have any kind of superpower in her normal form. What\u0026rsquo;s more, how could she keep these powers and her other identity a secret if they started to pop up in her normal form as well? Amanda\u0026rsquo;s words from two days before came back to her: she should tell him as soon as possible. Actually, Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t need to think about her best friends advice to know that she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to keep it a secret. Things would be a lot easier for them if he knew what was going on - after all, she still intended to go out on patrol at night, and having to lie to her boyfriend every time she did that just felt wrong. Boyfriend… Michelle still couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe that she now had one.\nJames had barely arrived at his apartment as his phone rang. Three month of boredom and now the police had him on speed-dial. Unsurprisingly, it was Det. Spencer who called to meet him at a certain restaurant. Since he hadn\u0026rsquo;t had breakfast yet, it only seemed practical to have it during an official meeting with the police. After a quick change of clothes, he made his way to said restaurant. His heart jumped at the idea that he might run into his girlfriend much faster than expected. But the closer he got to his destination, the more this anticipation faded, being replaced by a strange awareness that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t there.\nOnce he entered the place, James looked around for familiar faces to find that Michelle was indeed not among them. He located Det. Spencer sitting at a table and made his way towards him. With a grunt he sat down on his chair. For the first time today James noticed how sore his muscles were. As if he had spent the night working out instead of… ok now he got it.\n\u0026ldquo;Looks like your date last night was quite a success,\u0026rdquo; Jacob began.\n\u0026ldquo;You could say that\u0026hellip; Wait how did you know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This ear-to-ear-smile of yours practically screams out \u0026lsquo;I got laid\u0026rsquo;.\u0026rdquo; Jacob explained with a smile that was almost as wide as James\u0026rsquo;s. Was he proud to show off his perceptive skills or had he been \u0026lsquo;working out\u0026rsquo; last night as well? James decided he didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to know.\n\u0026ldquo;So why the sudden invitation for breakfast?\u0026rdquo; James tried to change the subject.\nThe smile on Jacob\u0026rsquo;s face vanished as he took on a much more serious expression. \u0026ldquo;It seems like this whole superpowered women story has taken a turn for the worse.\u0026rdquo;\nThe waitress appeared to take their order. James recognized her. Amanda Steward. He had met her yesterday in the hospital, one of the few civilians that even knew about the existence of superpowered women. Jacob also eyed her in a \u0026lsquo;do I know you?\u0026rsquo; kind of way. While they placed their order, James felt Amanda\u0026rsquo;s judging gaze upon him. Was it really that obvious that he had sex last night?\nEventually Amanda left the table and Jacob continued with the topic at hand.\n\u0026ldquo;I heard about that redhead that crippled this Ryley guy. Sounds like it was an accident, and I clearly hope that it was one.\u0026rdquo;\nThat was odd. Two days ago Jacob had suspected the hostage of being an accomplice of the bank robbers, and now he gave this redhead the benefit of a doubt?\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, we know too little to make a better guess.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right, but how about we try to guess a little? If this redhead underestimated her abilities it may be possible for others with the same kind of powers to do the same.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If there are more than these two,\u0026rdquo; James knew that this became much more likely with the confirmation of a second superwoman.\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s take the worst case scenario and assume that there\u0026rsquo;s some kind of drug out there that gives its user superpowers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d be careful with these assumptions. Your conclusion will be useless if reality doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit your assumptions.\u0026rdquo;\nJacob waved his hand dismissively. \u0026ldquo;I know that. So let there be a way for people to get superpowers. In this case this means that they don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know how to use these powers, right?\u0026rdquo;\nJames nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;So unless the person spends some time getting to know his or her powers, chances are high there\u0026rsquo;s an accident like gripping something - or someone - with too much force.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe, maybe not. This might depend on the \u0026lsquo;superpower\u0026rsquo; that\u0026rsquo;s used. The blonde superwoman seemed to have a talent for knocking out her enemies with a single punch without causing any permanent damage.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Damn, you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; Jacob clearly hadn\u0026rsquo;t considered this. \u0026ldquo;But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t rule out the possibility that these women might actually use too much force in certain situations - like sex for example.\u0026rdquo;\nFor a moment, James wondered if the other man was messing with him, but Jacob\u0026rsquo;s tone was still serious.\n\u0026ldquo;Are we talking about the very possibility of these superwomen having sex with a normal man? In this case I don\u0026rsquo;t have the slightest clue and have to say \u0026lsquo;probably\u0026rsquo;. It goes without saying that they can use this strength to hurt their partner.\u0026rdquo;\nJacob frowned. \u0026ldquo;In a way, yes this is the topic. I\u0026rsquo;m more interested in how likely these sex-accidents are.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got to be kidding me. Don\u0026rsquo;t you think there\u0026rsquo;s more important stuff to consider than silly theories about their sex-lives?\u0026rdquo;\nAnother frown. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m bringing this up just out of curiosity. Last night a man was found in critical condition. His injuries focus on the lower part of his body with several broken bones including his spine. This guy will be paralyzed from the waist down at best, and that\u0026rsquo;s assuming he survives. You see, this may sound like a silly topic, but whether or not these women can control their strength marks the difference between a really unfortunate accident and assault - if not murder. And I\u0026rsquo;m not even considering the possibility that he was raped.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is it even clear that he was injured during sex?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;About 90% I\u0026rsquo;d say. They found him half-naked in an alley, his clothes scattered around him and - the only real clue we have - vaginal fluids on his penis.\u0026rdquo;\nThat was the moment when Amanda arrived with their order.\nGreat, James thought. Now I\u0026rsquo;ve got to eat breakfast with this image in mind. Good thing that I\u0026rsquo;m not that easily disgusted.\n\u0026ldquo;So you\u0026rsquo;ve got a DNA sample of the \u0026lsquo;culprit\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo; James continued once Amanda had left the table again.\n\u0026ldquo;It should be waiting for you at your lab. My colleagues actually called me in the middle of the night for that. We can be damn happy that the doctors at the ER didn\u0026rsquo;t just wash the evidence away before he went to surgery.\u0026rdquo; Jacob yawned and in answer to that took a sip of his coffee.\nJames nodded in approval as he ate his breakfast.\nJacob had been true to his word. The DNA sample had been lying at his desk when James arrived at his workplace. He didn\u0026rsquo;t waste any time and immediately began analyzing it. And indeed, the sample showed a similar mutation than the one of the dead prostitute that they referred to as \u0026lsquo;Jane Doe\u0026rsquo;. So there was a connection between her and the superpowered women after all. But how could this be explained? There were two seemingly invulnerable women on the one side and a dead woman on the other. Maybe the powers varied depending on the individual, or they could actually be temporary. This would support Jacob\u0026rsquo;s theory about a superpower-granting drug. Quite a lot of information for a simple look through the microscope, but not nearly enough for James' taste.\nA knock on the door interrupted James' trail of thoughts.\n\u0026ldquo;Come in.\u0026rdquo;\nThe man who entered seemed to be in his early fifties and as scrawny as you\u0026rsquo;d expect from one of the most renowned scientists in the world. Prof. Christopher Harland was famous for two things: His obsession with his work and the methods with which he financed it. The genetic sickness that was mostly known as Harland-syndrome wasn\u0026rsquo;t named after him because he discovered it, but because he\u0026rsquo;s the only person who actually tried to cure it. Unfortunately, the chances of success are so slim, that he\u0026rsquo;d long since lost any funding, which forced him to take desperate measures in order to get the necessary money for his research. In a nutshell he got paid by the human test subjects he tried his cure on. This would be fine if the costs weren\u0026rsquo;t so ridiculously high and the success rate so low, meaning that the vast majority of his \u0026lsquo;patients\u0026rsquo; paid a fortune just to die. Of course, Harland had been sued several times because of it, but never had he been found guilty.\n\u0026ldquo;Dr. Thompson, I presume?\u0026rdquo; Harland asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed, what can I do for you Prof. Harland?\u0026rdquo; James forced himself to be polite. He didn\u0026rsquo;t like Harland\u0026rsquo;s practices, but right now Harland was the best source of information. After all, he had been hired specifically to research the mutated Jane Doe.\n\u0026ldquo;I heard that you are investigating some… extraordinary individuals. And there\u0026rsquo;s a possibility that these individuals are connected to the mutated woman I\u0026rsquo;m examining right now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s correct, even though I\u0026rsquo;m a bit reserved about the possibility of a connection. I prefer not to jump to conclusions.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course. Then again it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to keep the eyes open for similarities. Unfortunately the organizational structure here doesn\u0026rsquo;t encourage this. You\u0026rsquo;ve got your assignment and I got mine, and the only communication here comes through the reports you turn in - of which I receive a copy.\u0026rdquo;\nJames clenched his fist. He had expected that it would turn out this way: Harland would be informed about everything he reported while he still waited for the updated report as to what was found in or on the meteor. Harland seemed to notice this gesture as he continued.\n\u0026ldquo;I think we both agree that it would be more efficient if this communication weren\u0026rsquo;t so… formal or one-sided. If we were to talk about our recent findings and theories, we\u0026rsquo;d both benefit of it, don\u0026rsquo;t you think?\u0026rdquo;\nNot really. Since James was more or less kept out of the loop, he would be the only one to benefit here. Why would Harland come up with such a proposal then? James hadn\u0026rsquo;t hidden that much information for a newcomer like him to notice, especially since none of it was relevant in any way.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m all ears. Do you have any theory that I should keep my eyes open for?\u0026rdquo; James tested.\n\u0026ldquo;As a matter of fact I do. Right now I\u0026rsquo;m looking for a clue as to what caused the actual mutation. I\u0026rsquo;m suspecting some kind of virus-like carrier that instead of injecting a single RNA strand includes the additional chromosomes into the nucleus. Following the virus-analogy, it could be possible that other people can get infected the way they might catch a flu. Of course, this is still a theory, as I haven\u0026rsquo;t found any trace in Jane Doe yet. Maybe the carrier has long since left her system or got decomposed after its job was done, the fact that she\u0026rsquo;s been dead for some time now doesn\u0026rsquo;t help.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see. So you want me to get everybody Jane Doe had been in contact with to show up here?\u0026rdquo;\nHarland shook his head. \u0026ldquo;I already arranged for that to happen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So what do you want?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As I said earlier, there might be a connection. Meaning that if there is a virus involved, these women you\u0026rsquo;re chasing may actually be patient zero and thus possibly infecting other people they come into contact with. I suggest you arrange for anybody who came into contact with them to be examined. Maybe even quarantined.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think a few blood samples will suffice until we have any further clue. After all we don\u0026rsquo;t want to cause a panic.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you say so,\u0026rdquo; Harland shrugged his shoulders in a mocking way. \u0026ldquo;Just let me know if you find something abnormal, ok?\u0026rdquo; He turned around and left the room.\nHe hadn\u0026rsquo;t even asked if James had found something new. Then again he clearly had read James' most recent report, otherwise he would still assume that there was only one superwoman. In other words, Harland had made the very mistake he had claimed to avoid, because had he really talked about James' findings, he would\u0026rsquo;ve known about the newest DNA sample that was now in his possession.\nJames jumped of his chair and went back to analyze the sample. \u0026ldquo;If there really is a viral carrier involved, this should be the first place to look.\u0026rdquo;\nSix o\u0026rsquo;clock. Michelle was roaming through her apartment like a headless chicken. The day had gone by way to fast, leaving her with little to no time to actually prepare for this evening. All she had done was some grocery shopping to avoid another \u0026lsquo;no breakfast\u0026rsquo; morning. Michelle had no plan how this should go. James would arrive any second and the only point on Michelle\u0026rsquo;s agenda was the talk. And despite her knowing for a fact that he loved her, she still was nervous about this particular topic.\nDing-dong.\nFinally! Michelle rushed towards her apartment door and opened it. As expected James stood there, his face visibly lightening up as he spotted Michelle. Once again her nervousness was washed away by his sheer presence.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi,\u0026rdquo; he said as Michelle beckoned him in.\nOnce he had entered and the door was closed, Michelle literally jumped him for a kiss that lasted well over a minute before she finally spoke. \u0026ldquo;Missed you,\u0026rdquo; she whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;Me too,\u0026rdquo; was all James managed to answer.\nMichelle immediately noticed that there was something bothering James. After the first euphoria of meeting again vanished, she could practically feel a strange sorrow on her boyfriend.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s on your mind?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked directly. She didn\u0026rsquo;t even waste any second speculating what might be the problem.\n\u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; uhm,\u0026rdquo; James stammered.\nRealizing she had rushed things a bit, Michelle slowly guided him to the living room. That should give him a few precious seconds to sort his thoughts, she figured as they sat down next to each other on her couch.\n\u0026ldquo;I think I have a confession to make,\u0026rdquo; James began before taking a deep breath. \u0026ldquo;Remember the hair you gave me this morning?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;And do you remember the mutated woman I mentioned yesterday?\u0026rdquo;\nShe nodded again, her eyes focused on his.\n\u0026ldquo;I… uhm…\u0026rdquo; James was stammering again. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m really sorry, I mean it was just a hunch. I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean to\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle brought her hand to his cheek. James tensed up as she touched him and slowly, calmly asked \u0026ldquo;What did you do?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I tested your hair,\u0026rdquo; James almost sounded relieved to have said it out loud. Whispering, he added \u0026ldquo;And it showed the same kind of mutation as that dead woman.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Is that all?\u0026rdquo;\nJames nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;Nobody else knows this?\u0026rdquo;\nHe nodded again, surprised at how calmly Michelle dealt with the news.\n\u0026ldquo;Then why are you so concerned about this?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I betrayed your trust. You didn\u0026rsquo;t intend for me to test this, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually I burned to know the truth about it myself. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s why you even got the idea to do it. But you clearly didn\u0026rsquo;t betray my trust as long as none of your coworkers learned about this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You bet!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good. Now since we\u0026rsquo;re on the topic, I want to try something out.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle guided James' face closer to hers for another kiss. As their lips met, Michelle tried to recreate the strange stream of memories that she had experienced when they had kissed for the first time. But this time, she tried to make it go the other way. Instead of her seeing James' memories, she tried to send a certain memory of her own towards him. A memory of a place somewhere in the mountains where she tried out her super strength for the first time\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Wow,\u0026rdquo; James said after the kiss. He looked at Michelle with utter amazement. \u0026ldquo;That boulder\u0026hellip; it was you who moved it, right?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle nodded slowly. She didn\u0026rsquo;t know whether she should smile or even laugh. The fact that she had just telepathically sent a memory towards her boyfriend alone was reason enough to be happy, but his reaction was even better. Michelle watched intently as James processed the bit of information he had just received. Thankfully this information hadn\u0026rsquo;t been as big a shock as it could have been - he already knew that there was something wrong with Michelle after all.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok,\u0026rdquo; James eventually exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;I think you have to explain this to me. Otherwise I\u0026rsquo;m bound to jump to the wrong conclusion.\u0026rdquo;\nNot exactly the kind of reaction Michelle had hoped for - but also far from what she had feared. Then again Michelle had only considered the two most extreme variants, him either being enthusiastic or freaked out. She didn\u0026rsquo;t really like this uncertainty, so she reached out for his hand, forcing a reaction. He grabbed her hand, and her heart jumped in joy.\n\u0026ldquo;After the meteor scare I found a strange seed on the sidewalk\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she began. Michelle told the whole story, how she accidentally drank the potion that caused her initial transformation. How she tested out her new powers in the mountains - the very events that had led him to her. She also mentioned how she repeated this stunt the very next day - this time with her best friend in tow. In great detail she recalled her first heroic action - saving a small girl who shared her name from a fire. She continued with her first patrol that had followed that night, and every noteworthy event after that - including her encounter with James who eventually began to ask questions of his own, turning her one-sided narration into a lively conversation.\nAmanda jumped up the stairs that led to her apartment as if she was hunted by death himself. She had covered the entire distance from the hospital to her place in about twenty minutes - the same time she would\u0026rsquo;ve needed had she used a car. Even though she had no illusions that she might outrun a car on an open street, it was quite the feat for Amanda. This was one of the many improvements that Amanda\u0026rsquo;s body had been subjected to. Still, once she had come to a stop, she realized that she had indeed pushed her body to its limit - taking a full minute until she had finally caught her breath. In her exhausted state, Amanda noticed that one thing was still missing: perspiration. Every person who had sprinted through the streets or run up the stairs like she had just done would be sweating profoundly - Amanda on the other hand had not a single drop of sweat on her body. Amanda was still ambivalent about these changes to her body, since each new revelation only reminded her of her own screw-up when she first drank the potion. She had wanted to wait until she had a better idea of any side-effects of the potion, but now she was experiencing them first-hand. At lunch, Michelle had informed her about some other side-effects that may soon manifest in herself too. Her best friend seemed to appreciate every single change that potion had done to her, no matter how inconvenient. The good news was that Amanda never had to wear glasses that could suddenly become obsolete, but being able to fly in her normal form might become troublesome. Right now the part that had interested Amanda the most had been Michelle\u0026rsquo;s theories about mind-reading. This could actually solve Amanda\u0026rsquo;s most pressing problem: finding out whatever Fred had been hiding from her.\nAs expected, Amanda had not been able to read Fred\u0026rsquo;s mind when she had visited him today after work. He also hadn\u0026rsquo;t dropped any hint at what he was hiding from her the whole time. Fortunately Amanda still had an ace in the hole with her alter ego. Once Erika had arrived, she had excused herself because she needed to work the early shift. A blatant lie considering her significantly reduced need for sleep, but it was helpful in this situation. Amanda had thus sprinted homewards, not because she wanted to test how fast her untrained body could go, but because she hoped that the critical topic might come up between Fred and Erika - and any second it took to get home counted.\nHaving caught her breath, Amanda wasted no further moment and began undressing. Her muscles still ached from the run, but Amanda ignored the pain as she knew it would stop soon. Even with all her guilt over drinking the potion too early, the idea of drinking the potion was still as thrilling as ever. Once she was naked she took out the vial with the familiar green liquid. All this power - Amanda was a bit scared to possess it again. Especially since this time there would be no Michelle to watch over her. No, Amanda had acquired a decent amount of control over these powers, all she had to do was to keep calm and nobody would get hurt. Closing her eyes, she downed the potion.\nImmediately she could feel the effects. Amanda felt her brain working faster and faster while at the same time she felt her hair getting longer - and as she knew, redder. She even felt how her eyes shifted from their normal black color to an unnatural orange while her face rearranged itself before the rest of her body followed suit. The incredible feeling of the super energy inside her body was intoxicating. Her formerly aching muscles now emitted pure pleasure as they grew to fitness model size while her body gained a foot in height. This time Amanda even noticed the very moment her flight powers activated themselves, lifting her body off the floor. It took only a few seconds for the blonde woman to turn into a redheaded goddess, but they were very intense seconds.\nFacing her mirror, Amanda summoned her costume. After her last training session with Michelle, she had spent the rest of her super energy testing out different variations for a real superhero costume that could replace the simple blue leotard she had used before. Her current favorite was a tank top and tight spandex-like pants - both black with red flames as highlights. Much more suitable for her red hair and the codename Devil than her incomplete Supergirl rip-off had been. It was still a work in progress, even though her progress was probably much further than Michelle\u0026rsquo;s, who seemed convinced that a black leotard alone would suffice. Her biggest issue so far was the footwear. Amanda had considered boots but found that creating such a thick fabric used up a bit too much super energy for her liking while flat ballerinas like Michelle used simply looked ridiculous with the flame-theme. Her current compromise looked more like socks that were part of her pants - or tights for that matter. Anyway, she had a lot of time to rethink her costume before she would actually use it, but right now she had something else to do. She opened her window and took to the sky.\nEven though the twenty minutes for her run from the hospital to her apartment had been remarkable, they paled compared to the six seconds Amanda had needed to return to the hospital. And this time she had even taken a detour, flying high up over the city before descending towards the hospital instead of a straight line. This way it was harder to determine in which direction she flew since a straight line was a bit too predictable. Now she hovered right next to Fred\u0026rsquo;s room, watching both him and Erika with her X-Ray vision through the wall she herself hid behind. They were indeed talking, but while the wall between them was not hindrance for her eyes, Amanda couldn\u0026rsquo;t actually hear them.\nThis is the part where super hearing would be really handy, Amanda thought. She remembered how she had discovered her heat-vision by channeling her super energy into her eyes. Right now she channeled the energy into her ears. Amanda knew that in fiction characters were normally caught off-guard by their super-hearing that turned normal background noises into a cacophony. Since she had to consciously try it, she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to run into this trap and only increased the energy slowly. Still she could feel her plan working, all the sounds she heard became clearer, but not louder. Slowly she began to pick up more sounds. Normally these sounds were simply not loud enough to be heard, and Amanda quickly managed to separate different voices and communications that were taking place in the hospital. Amanda marveled at the possibilities that came with this. With the combined usage of her X-Ray vision and her super hearing she could supervise the whole building. It took her a few moments until she finally managed to focus on Fred and Erika\u0026rsquo;s conversation.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you really expect this to work out? Amanda knows that you\u0026rsquo;re hiding something from her. It would be naïve, not to mention cruel of you to demand that she ignores this.\u0026rdquo; That voice belonged to Erika.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;ll have to deal with it for now.\u0026rdquo; Fred sounded a bit grumpy. He obviously didn\u0026rsquo;t like this topic.\n\u0026ldquo;Why? You cheated on her and she took you back, from where I\u0026rsquo;m standing she deserves to know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve heard that one before.\u0026rdquo; Fred rolled his eyes. \u0026ldquo;And it didn\u0026rsquo;t work out back then!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a totally different situation now. And Amanda is a much stronger woman than Rachel was. She can handle it.\u0026rdquo;\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve got no idea how right you are.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you even hear yourself talking? You said the exact same thing about Rachel back then. Comparing her to all my other exes and coming to the conclusion that she could handle the truth. And guess what? She couldn\u0026rsquo;t. We broke up because of that and she even said that it would\u0026rsquo;ve been easier if she had never known. I\u0026rsquo;ve been down this road too many times to risk losing Amanda the same way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then why did you get back together with her in the first place? After all you didn\u0026rsquo;t seem all that interested in apologizing until that red-headed freak showed up! Did she somehow force you to do that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What? No, it\u0026rsquo;s not like that. First I thought that having a clean break-up would be the best for both of us. But things look a bit different, when you wake up in the hospital and instead of the woman you want at your side right now, you get the person responsible for your condition. Doing the very thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t to Amanda: apologizing. And the funny thing is, the more I talked to her, and the better I got along with her, the more I wanted Amanda to be here. If only for a limited time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did you ever think about what Amanda gets out of the deal? She swallows some outrageous stories about superpowered women, but you deny her the simple explanation why you cheated on the women you want at your side when things turn sour? Selfish doesn\u0026rsquo;t even begin to describe it!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m aware of that. But you know that things are a bit more complicated.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re scared she might dump you for something that\u0026rsquo;s beyond your control even after tolerating you cheating on her. That\u0026rsquo;s not complicated at all, you\u0026rsquo;re just a wimp. And I don\u0026rsquo;t remember my brother being a wimp.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How about we change the subject?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, let\u0026rsquo;s get a bit of fresh air, shall we?\u0026rdquo; Erika stood up, went towards the window, and opened it. As she turned back to face Fred, she continued. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been wondering why - out of all people - we encountered these women. Actually, if it was just me, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have thought too much about it, considering my situation back there. But it is indeed strange that you met this red-headed freak at about the same time. Maybe they are people we know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The one I met, didn\u0026rsquo;t resemble anyone I know.\u0026rdquo; Fred answered.\nLiar, you mentioned the similarities between the two me\u0026rsquo;s twice already.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, same for the blonde one. But what if they can change their appearance? If they can fly and are bulletproof, this is a possibility.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And in this case it could be anybody.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really? Don\u0026rsquo;t you think you could narrow the identity of the redhead down a bit by concentrating on those women that were pissed you at the moment?\u0026rdquo; Erika suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;Only if I want to make myself look like a fool.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why\u0026rsquo;s that? I mean there had to be a reason this redhead chose you to mess around with. And her behavior does fit that of a pissed-of ex-girlfriend. The question would be which of them fits better.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And then what? I just assume that one of the suspects is her and analyze every tiny thing they do in my presence to prove my suspicions? I\u0026rsquo;m not that paranoid.\u0026rdquo; Fred blurted out.\n\u0026ldquo;Calm down, it\u0026rsquo;s not paranoia if there\u0026rsquo;s a valid reason to it. And if it turns out to be true, the topic will turn up sooner or later so it\u0026rsquo;s best to be prepared for it.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda didn\u0026rsquo;t like the direction the conversation was taking. Erika was on the right track here.\n\u0026ldquo;What kind of preparation are you talking about?\u0026rdquo; Fred sounded curious - but a hint of surprise was audible as well.\n\u0026ldquo;You mentioned that she visited you to apologize. But she also said that she will come back eventually. The question is what will happen if Amanda is here at that moment? How will she react upon seeing your girlfriend?\u0026rdquo;\nScrew her being on the right track.\nFred was visibly confused now. \u0026ldquo;Weren\u0026rsquo;t you implying that Amanda is the redhead?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What? No, Amanda can barely hold her liquor so I doubt she flies around in her spare time.\u0026rdquo;\nGood, keep thinking that.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re not seriously considering that Susan might be the redhead?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ha! So it was that bitch after all! She clearly has the immature tendency for senseless destruction.\u0026rdquo;\nWell, at least I have a name now, even though I don\u0026rsquo;t know a Susan.\n\u0026ldquo;But lacks the patience to wait for an excuse at using it. Sorry, but those two are too different character-wise to even consider that possibility. To be honest, the idea of Susan with superpowers is scary to say the least. That girl\u0026rsquo;s got issues. I also can\u0026rsquo;t imagine her apologizing for what she did.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you say so. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I met any of them in person, I only know that this spoiled brat has quite the reputation. But if you got such a good grasp at the redheads character, does that mean you couldn\u0026rsquo;t rule out Amanda?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda gulped hard as she heard that, but more importantly she could hear Fred\u0026rsquo;s heart beat faster as well. Oh God, he obviously suspected me!\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s why I said it\u0026rsquo;s no use theorizing about it. Just because I can\u0026rsquo;t rule her out yet doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that I have to assume that they are the same person.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, since she\u0026rsquo;s your girlfriend, you could ask?\u0026rdquo; Erika suggested.\n\u0026ldquo;Such a question would only cause distrust. I expect her to trust me that my affair with Susan was not meant to harm her in any way - and you know that this is true. So I naturally trust her that if she hides something from me, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean any harm for me as well. That being said, you already mentioned that she can\u0026rsquo;t possibly be the redhead, so why even bother with this theorizing?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Erika tried to find the right words, but she couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a flaw in his logic. \u0026ldquo;Ok, I give up. You obviously put some thought into this.\u0026rdquo;\nIndeed, this sounds suspiciously well thought-out.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you ready?\u0026rdquo; Michelle\u0026rsquo;s question was more aimed at herself than the man sitting in front of her. After almost two hours of talking about her powers and what she had done with them so far, James had finally worked up the courage to ask her for a demonstration. Now that the critical moment was drawing near, she was getting nervous. For the whole day, she had secretly fantasized about how this very moment would play out. Memories of her second transformation had popped up in her head, back then she had given Amanda quite a show. But unfortunately, her transformations had happened faster each subsequent time, meaning that James would have only a short time frame to watch the changes happening. Too bad he lacked the enhanced senses Michelle had used while watching Amanda. In order to put on a great show for James she would have to somehow take control over the transformation itself. She silently cursed herself for never even attempting it. Now she had to succeed on her first try, because she really wanted to make this a memory of a lifetime for her boyfriend.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s wrong?\u0026rdquo; James asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a bit nervous about being naked right now,\u0026rdquo; Michelle lied. \u0026ldquo;Would you mind undressing as well?\u0026rdquo;\nJames looked surprised, maybe even a bit shocked. Clearly he had noticed her true intentions behind this.\n\u0026ldquo;Uhm, ok sure.\u0026rdquo;\nEven though he seemed a bit nervous about the idea, he pulled through with it. This gave Michelle new confidence in that she would be able to make it one hell of a show. She watched James intently as he undressed as well. Michelle began to wonder what her boyfriend would look like if he had drunk the potion. Oh yeah, this had been a fantasy ever since her first transformation. To have sex with someone on her own level. As she thought about it a bit more, a weird feeling came over her.\n\u0026ldquo;Now you\u0026rsquo;re making me really nervous with this terrified expression.\u0026rdquo; James sounded concerned now. \u0026ldquo;Are you alright?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I just thought about giving you the potion as well and I… think it\u0026rsquo;s a really bad idea.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Listen, I have no intention of taking this potion if that\u0026rsquo;s what you mean.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But I had the intention of giving it to you eventually! And suddenly, from one moment to another this sounds like a grave mistake that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly want. And I have no idea why.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, calm down. Let\u0026rsquo;s start from the beginning: Why did you want me to take it in the first place?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I - uhm - wondered how it would be like to have sex with someone as super as myself.\u0026rdquo; Michelle felt her face turning red in embarrassment. She noticed that James wasn\u0026rsquo;t laughing - or freaked out. This calm understanding of his, turned into her anchor for not freaking out herself - despite her contradicting feelings. No, she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t forgive herself if even a slight part of her was looking down on him in any kind of way.\n\u0026ldquo;I take it you would prefer it that way.\u0026rdquo;\nToo embarrassed to speak it out loud, Michelle simply nodded. \u0026ldquo;Sorry\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t be. It\u0026rsquo;s probably a side-effect of your mutation. I even have a theory: Try to imagine me drinking this potion, but from a different plant. Would this sound like a bad idea to you as well?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh no, this sounds great actually.\u0026rdquo; Michelle even felt aroused by it. \u0026ldquo;But why? I had no problems sharing the stuff with Amanda, why am I so picky when it comes to you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because of the mutation that comes along with drinking it. The 56 additional chromosomes are most likely directly from the plant, meaning that everyone that drinks the potion from the same plant gains the very same 56 additional chromosomes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I still don\u0026rsquo;t see the problem.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you know what the problem with incest is? Due to having a very limited gene pool, the chances for genetic diseases increases drastically. Humans subconsciously avoid this by not being attracted to siblings, which may be the problem here. Because if I drank the potion, in a twisted kind of way, I\u0026rsquo;d become your brother.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that mean that Amanda is my sister now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In a twisted kind of way: Yes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This is weird, but it actually makes sense. And it\u0026rsquo;s a big relief.\u0026rdquo; Michelle approached James, who embraced, then kissed her.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo; James asked once their lips separated.\n\u0026ldquo;I feared that me suddenly being against you drinking the potion was caused by some sort of subconscious arrogance or something like that.\u0026rdquo; Another kiss. \u0026ldquo;Now I know that my gut feeling has a complex and valid reason behind it. It\u0026rsquo;s good to know that my body and I are on the same page here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;After everything that happened to you, you\u0026rsquo;re concerned of becoming arrogant? Now I understand why I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen for you this fast: You\u0026rsquo;re just perfect.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aw, this is embarrassing, you haven\u0026rsquo;t even seen all of me yet.\u0026rdquo; With this she broke away from him, a big smile on her face. \u0026ldquo;But that\u0026rsquo;s about to change.\u0026rdquo; She slowly walked over to the glass of super potion she had prepared, giving James a good view on her naked backside. She turned around and brought it to her mouth, making sure that she had his full attention.\nMichelle let her body do the thinking right now, having found a new reason to trust her feelings. And these feelings told her that if there was a way for her to take control over the transformation process, she would find it now. As the potion entered her mouth and came in contact with her tongue, she immediately knew there was a way. Of course there was. Almost every feat she had done while in her super form had been a product of her manipulating this very energy to fulfill her wishes. She could feel it spreading through her head, supercharging her brain cells and increasing her awareness of it as it made it\u0026rsquo;s way through her body. Michelle quickly found a way to stall the process, but her success was limited. It was like trying to hold in a sneeze, or to hold her breath for too long. Her body instinctively wanted to spread the energy through itself and activate every cell. It took Michelle all her willpower until she had found a way to slow it down - by guiding it into the body part that was to transform next.\nAs always it started with her head. She opened her eyes and saw her vision becoming better and better. The dumbfounded look on his face clearly showed that James was noticing the changes as they happened. God, those eyes … like an ocean. She now directed the energy towards her hair. Letting it grow down her back and turn blonde while at the same time her face shifted as well. And here I thought her face had been pretty before\u0026hellip; Now the hard part began: trying to control the changes as the energy washed over her torso. Since it was futile to have one change at a time, Michelle concentrated to prevent her breast growth so that it would become the grand finale. This had more than one reason. First, James' attention would be focused on this instead of all the other changes if she were to let them happen together, second she knew that the breasts stored the excess energy, so it made sense to saturate the rest of her body first. And last, she was so aroused right now that her concentration hung by a hair\u0026rsquo;s thread. The combination of being together with her boyfriend, feeling his affection, hearing his thoughts not to mention that the transformation process was pleasurable by itself - all these feelings begged her to cease her futile resistance and let the transformation happen as fast as possible. Unbelievable, she\u0026rsquo;s almost as tall as I me right now\u0026hellip; Any further stimuli might break her concentration. She even smells great\u0026hellip; That was it, her concentration broke and so did her resistance. Immediately her transformation sped up, her muscles gaining definition, making her more imposing with her added height. Michelle moaned as her breasts surged outward, while her whole body rose off the ground. The most beautiful woman on earth hovering naked above the floor - sexiest image in history.\nMichelle didn\u0026rsquo;t waste any time, the moment it had finished, she acted upon the primal desire that had built up during her transformation. One might say she jumped James, but a jump would require her to touch the ground. Instead, she simply flew into him, not even bothering to slow down as their naked bodies clashed. Their lips met, he lost his balance, then they slammed into the wall. For the following minutes their minds were focused solely on their lovemaking.\nHalf an hour later, they lay next to each other in Michelle\u0026rsquo;s bed.\n\u0026ldquo;That… was… awesome.\u0026rdquo; James finally managed to say after a long time of silence.\n\u0026ldquo;Glad you liked it,\u0026rdquo; Michelle answered.\nEvery muscle in my body hurts like hell, but damn this was worth it. I could get used to this kind of workout.\n\u0026ldquo;Already making training plans, huh?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What? C-can you read my mind too?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I was able to share my memories with you when I was in my normal form, now it\u0026rsquo;s just ridiculously easy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Incredible.\u0026rdquo; James exclaimed, his hand tracing up her arm. \u0026ldquo;And to think that these arms were powerful enough to lift this heavy boulder in the mountains.\u0026rdquo; I can consider myself lucky that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t injured here.\n\u0026ldquo;There was no luck involved here. I can share part of my powers upon touch, remember? You were invulnerable during our little… experiment.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, your powers really have a solution for everything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It actually happened almost subconsciously. Like I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop making you invulnerable and strong as long as we were still going. Even now, only the thought that you\u0026rsquo;re in no danger at all keeps me from doing it again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You really are one-of-a-kind.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, there\u0026rsquo;s Amanda as well.\u0026rdquo; Michelle\u0026rsquo;s expression darkened as she remembered the prostitute James had mentioned before. \u0026ldquo;And god knows how many more,\u0026rdquo; she added whispering.\nThe mood had turned. Michelle suddenly realized that she had ignored a vital part until now. Amanda and herself weren\u0026rsquo;t the only ones with access to this plant. There was at least one other plant out there - the dead prostitute was grim proof of that. How could she be enjoying herself while there was still such a danger out there?\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not your fault, you know.\u0026rdquo; James suddenly exclaimed - had he read her mind here?. \u0026ldquo;As long as we don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s going on out there, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to jump to conclusions. In fact, your knowledge already helps a lot here.\u0026rdquo; For example that we\u0026rsquo;re able to have sex without you seriously injuring me.\n\u0026ldquo;That was a concern for you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually more a concern of the police after they found a man that got injured during what seemed to be sex with a woman of your caliber. The big question was whether this was intentional on her part or an accident that might happen more often.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which means that there\u0026rsquo;s a woman out there with powers like mine who uses them to hurt others! That\u0026rsquo;s not a good news!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s more to it than just that. You see, the dead prostitute clearly had no idea how exactly she got these powers - her diary implies that she considered having them to be a hallucination.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean she was somehow slipped the potion and mistook its effects for a drug?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She was a drug addict to begin with, so maybe it was more like \u0026lsquo;wanna try out this new stuff?\u0026rsquo;, but we can\u0026rsquo;t know for sure. Actually she could\u0026rsquo;ve gotten the powers by accident, similar to how you accidentally drank the potion in the first place. Either way the fact that she had no idea might apply to the whoever had sex with that man. In this case she would be powerless without any idea how to get the powers back, meaning that she\u0026rsquo;d be essentially harmless.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Or she could be the one who gave the potion to the prostitute and used it on herself after the successful experiment,\u0026rdquo; Michelle retorted. \u0026ldquo;Only when we find her, will we know for sure. And this means I\u0026rsquo;ll have to patrol tonight.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I feared you would say that. This is the downside for dating a superheroine, huh?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle\u0026rsquo;s face turned red. \u0026ldquo;I may be super, but I\u0026rsquo;m far from being a heroine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, you\u0026rsquo;re just going on patrol with the intention of stopping whatever crime you come across - bringing yourself into danger as a result from it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You know that I\u0026rsquo;m pretty much invulnerable right now, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well your powers can run out, so I\u0026rsquo;d be a lot more at ease if you took a bit more of that potion to make sure you could handle any super-powered person you might come across.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle kissed him as a sign that she appreciated his concern. Through this kiss, she could clearly sense that his concern was even bigger than he let on. The very possibility that she might get in danger already caused some kind of protective instinct to emerge, it seemed. Michelle also noticed that he was tired, obviously their lovemaking had really worn him out. By the time their kiss ended, James had already fallen asleep. As Michelle slowly hovered out of her bed, she decided to take him by his word and drink a few extra doses before heading out on her nightly patrol.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part08/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 08"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"James got home and checked his calendar. Yes, today was Sunday. He didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like he had just spent a day off, which was a stark contrast to how his work had been before this weekend.\nAll these false alarms that had made his job miserable were forgotten thanks to the recent events. First, the strange movement of a boulder had led him to meet a woman who fascinated him enough to ask her for a date. It had been a while since he had been on a date and even longer since he had felt so nervous asking. The case of a dead prostitute had turned quite bizarre because the woman in question was some kind of mutant. But all of this paled compared to security footage of a woman beating up some bank robbers and saving a hostage. This woman looked like she had jumped straight out of a comic book, flying and shrugging off bullets as if they were nothing - or pleasurable - if he interpreted the wicked smile on her face correctly. The following interrogation of the saved hostage was comparatively boring as both James and Detective Jacob Spencer has watched the security footage beforehand. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t give any more information besides a short conversation she had with her savior and had preferred to flirt with both men instead - much to their chagrin. It hadn\u0026rsquo;t taken long for James to mention his upcoming date so that she would focus her flirting on Jacob - much to her chagrin. It seemed like Jacob was accustomed to women trying to flirt with him during interrogation and he countered it by pointing out every remotely suspicious part of her behavior. In the end she had to explain why she had volunteered to be taken hostage in the first place. James hadn\u0026rsquo;t even considered this suspicious, but rather brave of her. But as Jacob pointed out, an attractive woman in her late twenties was too ideal a hostage from the perspective of a bank robber, as she had much more to lose than an older person - which was why it seemed odd that she had volunteered. She did give a plausible reason, but it had a bitter aftertaste. He decided he\u0026rsquo;d go to bed early today, tomorrow would be an exciting day after all.\nMichelle was also excited about the future, but unlike James she couldn\u0026rsquo;t put it into words. She should have been scared, but all she felt was excitement. Her superhero career hadn\u0026rsquo;t even started (at least that\u0026rsquo;s how she saw it) but there were already some changes to the plan that didn\u0026rsquo;t really sit well with her. Michelle had intended to keep as low a profile as possible when it came to being a hero, but her best friend Amanda had made it clear that she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to prevent her becoming public knowledge, and thus a celebrity. She didn\u0026rsquo;t even consider her own shyness a problem since these powers gave her a lot of confidence. Her biggest concern was the media\u0026rsquo;s hunt for sensation and tragedy. Michelle hadn\u0026rsquo;t forgotten how they had added fuel to the fire during the meteor scare. If she became a public hero, she would be able to calm people down in a time of crisis. But this required a certain reputation. As a superheroine she would have to give the impression of being an infallible saint, perfect in every way. This was the part that scared Michelle the most: the pressure of not being allowed to fail, of never being allowed to make a mistake, because if she did, the media would make sure it would never be forgotten. And while the additional pressure made her nervous, there was one thought that drove Michelle: her biggest critic wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the media, but herself. Failure would mean someone getting hurt or even dying, when she could have prevented it. She would be the last person to forgive herself if this happened. Of course, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t naïve enough to believe she could save everyone and everything. Even with all her powers she still had limits, after all. In order to become an actual heroine, she needed to know these limits.\nA few hours ago Michelle had stopped a hostage situation and had learned the hard way that knowing her limits alone could be the difference between life and death. Super strength and invulnerability didn\u0026rsquo;t mean that she could leave her guard down as a well-placed punch could stall her due to her normal weight. During her training session with Amanda earlier, Michelle had countered this problem by using her flight powers to simulate the needed mass. They hadn\u0026rsquo;t been able to exercise this particular part for long, though since it required a great deal of super energy. It was strange, simply hovering at the same spot barely used any super energy, but the consumption increased exponentially the more force she put into her flight. Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t like this, not only because she found it odd that the consumption didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to scale with her effort, but mainly because it made her super strength useless for all she cared. Sure, she had carried boulders that weighed several tons without a problem, knowing that she was far from using her maximum strength, but what good was this strength for being a hero? In fact, Michelle was happy that her control over her strength was good enough not to accidentally kill a normal human with a simple touch. When she thought about situations where her strength alone could be helpful, the first thing that came to mind was the meteor crash a few months ago. And this was just one of the situations where she needed her flight powers to even apply it. Michelle seriously doubted she could prevent a meteor crash without drinking enormous amounts of super potion beforehand. \u0026gt;\nShe couldn\u0026rsquo;t accept that. Her flight powers were not only her absolute favorite but also the most versatile power she had. There had to be a way to reduce the energy consumption for flying when carrying something. Hovering cross-legged over her bed, Michelle tried to concentrate on how she flew in the first place. Today had been quite informative when it came to understanding her powers and she hoped to get a sudden flash of insight by meditating about it. Michelle felt how her body slowly changed the super energy from its raw form to the signature energy that kept her above her bed. It was interesting, but the only thing Michelle could say for sure was that there was no \u0026ldquo;flight organ\u0026rdquo;. Every cell in her body was involved. After about an hour her powers faded, forcing her to come out of her meditation. As her body reverted back to its normal form, Michelle also felt her fatigue getting the better of her. After all, she had only slept for two hours last night. She didn\u0026rsquo;t care whether or not her next round of sleep would be just as short, or that she would be naked on top of her covers when her powers wore off. She simply fell asleep.\nOnce again she seemed to relive her day in her dreams. From the prevented rape and the bullet to her chest that felt so good it had almost ruined everything. The loneliness from watching couples returning home. James. Amanda, crying as she had injured her ex-boyfriend with her new super powers. The hostage that still looked eerily familiar, but Michelle was sure she had never met her. Amanda transforming. Two women playing tag in the skies. Amanda\u0026rsquo;s eyes glowing orange, then unspeakable pleasure. Two women throwing rocks at each other. A copy of her super self hovering in front of her in an open white space. Wait a second.\n\u0026ldquo;We meet again,\u0026rdquo; the other Michelle spoke cheerfully.\nThis again? Michelle recalled her dream from last night, the same white space, the same copy of her super self. Still, something was different this time.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, um \u0026hellip; hi, I guess.\u0026rdquo; Michelle was still caught off-guard. Despite all her fears earlier, she had dismissed their first encounter as a dream. Not anymore.\n\u0026ldquo;Hello there,\u0026rdquo; her doppelganger giggled. She really seemed to be happy. \u0026ldquo;So, what brings you here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got no idea. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know what or where \u0026lsquo;here\u0026rsquo; is for that matter.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s where we meet,\u0026rdquo; said the other matter-of-factly, still keeping her cheerful attitude.\n\u0026ldquo;I figured as much. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t explain anything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know any better than you do.\u0026rdquo; For once her doppelganger sounded serious, but she still sported a dangerously charming smile.\n\u0026ldquo;Too sad. But who are \u0026lsquo;you\u0026rsquo; anyway?\u0026rdquo; Michelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t hide her curiosity any longer.\n\u0026ldquo;Hmm, I can\u0026rsquo;t explain that well. First I thought, I was part of you, but now I know I\u0026rsquo;m not. You and I are separate beings.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Like a split-personality?\u0026rdquo; Michelle voiced her fears.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; the other shook her head. \u0026ldquo;A split-personality would be still part of you, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s right,\u0026rdquo; Michelle said, relieved. Her other self emanated an innocence that made it hard for her to doubt her. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a lot more cheerful than last time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course I am. You\u0026rsquo;re here, helping me again, but this time I can help you as well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You say I help you, but I don\u0026rsquo;t see how I do that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s because you don\u0026rsquo;t value your own deeds the way I do. Just now you showed me your day, the events that happened since we last met, the feelings you had when you lived them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wait, you saw the dream I had just now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, I don\u0026rsquo;t really know how or why you showed it to me, but I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that you did. Through this I learned a lot about you, like how I can help you.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle was confused to say the least. During their first encounter, her doppelganger had bombarded her with questions, and clearly this curiosity hadn\u0026rsquo;t faded.\n\u0026ldquo;And how exactly do you intend to do that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know a few things that you don\u0026rsquo;t and that could help you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I figured as much,\u0026rdquo; Michelle was still surprised about the change of attitude in her other self. \u0026ldquo;The last suggestion you made to me was rather cruel, you know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, you clearly made your point regarding that. And you\u0026rsquo;ve proven that your way of doing things has a lot of potential.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My way of doing things? What exactly are you talking about. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall meeting this would-be-rapist again today.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about this scum alone. You have the tendency to see value in things that I would consider worthless. For example this\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle watched as her other self became covered in a black cat-suit. Even though it covered more than Michelle\u0026rsquo;s own leotard had, it left little to the imagination.\n\u0026ldquo;Originally this was a means of protection,\u0026rdquo; her other self continued. \u0026ldquo;To me this ability was useless the moment invulnerability was involved - I mean what better protection do you need when you can\u0026rsquo;t even be hurt. But you found a way to make this ability useful again - even though I don\u0026rsquo;t really get this shame you feel about being naked. Not only that, you even added a new possibility in using it to protect someone else - by combining it with the same invulnerability that made it outdated in the first place. It\u0026rsquo;s this quick adaptability that makes you outstanding.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It wasn\u0026rsquo;t that big a deal,\u0026rdquo; Michelle felt herself blush. She was getting praised too much lately.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe to you it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. But its only normal for us to perceive things differently here. To me these powers aren\u0026rsquo;t as exciting as they are to you, for example.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You know them better than I do, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know if better is the correct term. Your knowledge had grown before you shared it with me, so it\u0026rsquo;s more like I have different knowledge than you. You see, the powers only had one simple purpose: survival. Hovering above the ground makes it harder to get eaten, then there was this protective layer,\u0026rdquo; she gestured at the cat-suit she had created earlier. \u0026ldquo;And of course invulnerability as the ultimate protection.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How about the super senses, like X-Ray vision?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Those are just enhancements of your own abilities.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This also explains the super strength. What about heat vision?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a new one to me as well.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle opened her eyes, once again her conversation with her other self had ended abruptly and her sleep along with it. She felt cold; not a big surprise considering she lay naked on her bed instead of under the blanket. Interestingly the cold didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to affect her as much as she would have expected. Michelle was positive that she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t catch a cold this way. She was pretty sure that her super form could deal with any temperature, no matter how cold it was - at the expense of super energy, of course. Her mortal form was a different story, and snuggled under the covers. Now that she thought about it, even her super form preferred warmth. It had felt great to have her clothes burn off her body in the burning house and being hit by Amanda\u0026rsquo;s heat vision had been downright orgasmic. As she recalled the unexpected side-effect of her best friends newest superpower, Michelle noticed just how clear and detailed her memory of this moment was. Her whole neural system had been on overdrive back then, causing her to experience everything in slow-motion, but also making her much more sensitive. Just to make sure, Michelle recalled the first time she had used this ability and could clearly remember every detail of Amanda\u0026rsquo;s transformation earlier. Indeed, using her full super senses gave the term eidetic memory a whole new meaning.\nLooking at her clock, Michelle noticed that it was barely midnight. She smiled. Her reduced need for sleep wasn\u0026rsquo;t a one-time thing after all. This was one of the bigger improvements to her normal form as it allowed her much more free time and it would come in really handy for her plans to become a superhero. \u0026ldquo;No use in staying in bed\u0026rdquo;, Michelle thought, as she stood up and walked into her kitchen. As she took out the bottle of super potion in her fridge, she wondered whether she should spend the night on patrol or getting to know her powers even further\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Finally, work begins.\u0026rdquo; Amanda couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe that she felt this way on a Monday at 5 am. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t much of a morning person and naturally hated the morning shift. Today she was happy to work this shift for two reasons: First, this meant she\u0026rsquo;d be done with work sooner and she could go over to the hospital to visit Fred. The other reason was that she had only slept for a few hours and experienced firsthand why Michelle had gone on patrol the night before - she just couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep anymore. With all the boredom piling up, Amanda had been tempted to drink the dose of super potion she had in her possession. She was sure that had she had more than one potion available, she would have transformed again - if only out of boredom. For the future, she needed to find a hobby to fill her nights.\nNow that she was at work, her desire to transform was absolutely zero. This was partially caused by her being distracted, but most came from the improvements her earlier transformation had left on her body. Being a waitress, her improved looks directly translated to the tips she received, and the fact that work just seemed to be easier altogether meant that she could do it with an even friendlier attitude than normal. As much as she regretted the outcome of her first transformation, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t deny that it worked wonders on her income. Time flew by this morning and Amanda was grateful that her coworkers didn\u0026rsquo;t press her on her new look - especially her new hair color. It was good that she didn\u0026rsquo;t have to lie too much - at least until a familiar face entered the restaurant.\nAt first glance Erika seemed to be the perfect career woman. Her business attire combined with her confident attitude gave the impression that this woman was married to her job. But Amanda knew better. She knew that Erika wasn\u0026rsquo;t as high on the career ladder as her clothes suggested; she even seemed to lack the ambition to achieve a higher position at the bank she worked for. Amanda couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand this lack of ambition - she herself didn\u0026rsquo;t like her occupation mainly because her original goals had been much higher. Then again Amanda was even more at odds with Erika\u0026rsquo;s private life, as the other woman was rather wild when it came to that. To Erika the terms “boyfriend” or “relationship” didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to exist as she switched her lovers along with her underwear. Despite their different views, Amanda got along quite well with Erika, mostly because of the latter’s friendly and surprisingly loyal nature.\n\u0026ldquo;You look good today,\u0026rdquo; Erika sounded a bit surprised as she said that.\n\u0026ldquo;Same to you,\u0026rdquo; Amanda answered, even though she noticed the tired look in the other woman\u0026rsquo;s eyes. She knew Erika had to work on Sunday and thus hadn\u0026rsquo;t had much time to relax.\n\u0026ldquo;I heard you were sick, but it seems my brother exaggerated somewhat if you\u0026rsquo;re already working again.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda didn\u0026rsquo;t need to ask why Erika knew that. It was only natural for Fred to call her and tell her about his hospitalization. He must\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned Amanda\u0026rsquo;s condition back then, even though it was outdated by then.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh he wasn\u0026rsquo;t exaggerating. I\u0026rsquo;m just lucky that I recovered quickly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s good to hear. So you\u0026rsquo;re going to the hospital once you\u0026rsquo;re done here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, why should I?\u0026rdquo; lied Amanda. Fred hadn\u0026rsquo;t told her that he was hospitalized, so she needed to act the part.\n\u0026ldquo;Because your boyfriend is there, perhaps?\u0026rdquo; Erika sounded almost threatening. Even though she didn\u0026rsquo;t really pursue a relationship for herself, Erika did know what it meant to be in one. Amanda didn\u0026rsquo;t blame her for being protective of her family.\n\u0026ldquo;He\u0026rsquo;s in hospital?\u0026rdquo; Amanda feigned surprise. After all she was surprised, but more about Erika ignoring the fact that Amanda and Fred had broken up. \u0026ldquo;What happened?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t know?\u0026rdquo; Erika was too surprised to determine whether or not Amanda\u0026rsquo;s act was convincing. \u0026ldquo;His knee is ruined, nothing serious, but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t say a word about what happened. I thought that he\u0026rsquo;d be a bit more open to you as his girlfriend.\u0026rdquo;\n“Sorry to disappoint you here, but your brother wasn’t that honest with me either. He’ll have a lot of explaining to do if he wants to get back together with me.”\nErika’s eyes widened in shock as she heard that.\n“You… broke up?” Erika eventually muttered. “How? Why?”\n“About the how: he cheated on me. As for the why: I’ve got no idea! But he better have a good explanation. Not mentioning being in the hospital doesn’t help.” The fact that she was responsible for his condition on the other hand did.\n“Sounds like a lost cause to me,” Erika thought out loud. She clearly didn’t take this news well, and Amanda was once again surprised how supportive Erika was about their relationship. Too bad she couldn’t hint that Fred had an actual chance to salvage their relationship without making herself suspicious.\nTheir conversation didn’t last much longer, mostly because Amanda had to serve other customers while Erika was eating her breakfast. Still, Amanda made sure to get Fred’s room number so that she could pop by unannounced.\n\u0026ldquo;… and this is all we know so far,\u0026rdquo; James concluded his report. It hadn\u0026rsquo;t even taken him fifteen minutes to fill his superior - Professor John Smith - in on the news of this weekend - including the security video that showed the superpowered blonde goddess beating up some bank robbers. Needless to say they were amazed by the presented footage.\n\u0026ldquo;Are there any connections between Jane Doe and …\u0026rdquo; he gestured at the screen that had just showed the security footage \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;her?\u0026rdquo;\nJane Doe - the alias made it clear that the prostitute\u0026rsquo;s real name wasn\u0026rsquo;t much of an issue here. James himself had deliberately not memorized it, either. He preferred to differentiate between the woman that had lived a miserable life that ended in tragedy and the scientifically valuable corpse she left behind.\n\u0026ldquo;She described one of her drug trips like \u0026lsquo;being able to fly\u0026rsquo; but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean anything. As long as the autopsy doesn\u0026rsquo;t hint otherwise, I think it\u0026rsquo;s better not to consider them related.\u0026rdquo;\nProfessor Smith nodded affirmatively. \u0026ldquo;About the autopsy, I\u0026rsquo;m going to have Professor Harland do it. He\u0026rsquo;s the best when it comes to genetic diseases and he can start quickly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What about me?\u0026rdquo; James could barely hide his disappointment. He had been afraid that something like this was going to happen, but he had no valid argument against it. Harland was the big fish here, it was only logical to let him handle the mutated \u0026lsquo;Jane Doe\u0026rsquo;, no matter how much James would have preferred to do so himself. Mentioning his personal dislike of Harland\u0026rsquo;s practices would only make him seem petty.\n\u0026ldquo;You continue as before. Everything out of the ordinary could be a clue for either this superpowered woman, Jane Doe or both. Harland will fill you in on what he finds as well. Make sure the police knows what to search for.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right now they\u0026rsquo;re keeping their eyes open for this blonde woman. She has been said to have prevented two muggings last night, if the witnesses are to be believed. They\u0026rsquo;re trying to keep the media out of the picture and urge us to do the same.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a given, but it depends on how low a profile Blondie wants to keep. If she wants to become famous all she has to is step in front of a camera after all. Let\u0026rsquo;s hope we have some explanation to calm the public down once she becomes public knowledge. If we leave the explaining to the media, things are going to end badly. We don\u0026rsquo;t need another meteor scare.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of which, was there anything about the meteor that could be connected to these two women?\u0026rdquo; James asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe. I\u0026rsquo;ll get you an updated memo about what the department discovered.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the end, James could be happy with the outcome of this discussion. He may have lost his access to \u0026lsquo;Jane Doe\u0026rsquo; but in return he would get some input on the meteor. And hunting every mystery made a lot more sense now that he knew there was something out there worth finding.\nThe day went quickly for Michelle. Her colleagues seemed to notice her improved looks even if they didn\u0026rsquo;t realize that she had changed. She was also anxious that someone would know about her super form or discuss her actions, but none of that happened either. She liked how everything was pretty normal, yet still better than Friday or the weeks before. More than before, Michelle felt that the improvements to her body weren\u0026rsquo;t merely cosmetic in nature. Everything seemed easier now. Even her motivational problems were history.\nMichelle didn’t attribute the last part to the changes her body had gone through over the last few days, though. Sure, the fact that work was easier was motivating, but it was still the same work that had gotten her down over the past weeks. Nothing had changed on that front. The true difference was that today, Michelle had something to look forward to. And it was ’t the possibility of drinking the super potion and the powers that came from it, either. She was anticipating something much more mundane, even though to her it was even more special than flying through the clouds was: a date. Saturday night, when she had been patrolling the city for the first time, she had envied the couples that were walking home together at that point. Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t miss the irony in that. In fact, she welcomed it. After all, the goal of finding love had been one of the few things that hadn\u0026rsquo;t changed through getting these powers.\nAmanda approached the hospital with a quick pace. Once her shift was over, she had practically run back to her apartment, changed out of her work clothes into something more appropriate. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t dressed up too much: a green blouse, tight jeans and a pair of heels to make her appear taller. After all she was a proud woman worthy of being fought for, not a dumb girl that would fight for a lost cause. Now she walked through the halls of the hospital as if she owned the place. Amanda tried to ignore the fact that this was the place she had dreamed of working at long ago. This had been easier yesterday when she had entered Fred\u0026rsquo;s room through the open window. Since she couldn\u0026rsquo;t fly to the second floor this time, she had to take the stairs and finally the door. She knocked and entered to find a surprise.\nFred wasn\u0026rsquo;t alone in his room, another man was standing in front of his bed. Amanda didn\u0026rsquo;t know this guy, so it was unlikely that he was one of Fred\u0026rsquo;s buddies. He was about the same age as them, tall and - Amanda had to admit - handsome.\n\u0026ldquo;A-Amanda,\u0026rdquo; as expected Fred was totally surprised. \u0026ldquo;What are you doing here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s my line. Erika told me that you\u0026rsquo;re here, but she had no idea why you\u0026rsquo;re here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Welcome to the club,\u0026rdquo; the other man interrupted. He put an end to her speculations by introducing himself. \u0026ldquo;Hi, my name\u0026rsquo;s James Thompson. I was just talking to Mr. Ryley about how he ended up here, as well. He claims to be run over by his own car, but I\u0026rsquo;m not convinced this is everything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Amanda Steward, nice to meet you.\u0026rdquo;\nSo this was Michelle\u0026rsquo;s date? Amanda couldn\u0026rsquo;t deny her best friend\u0026rsquo;s taste, but his presence here was a bit problematic.\n\u0026ldquo;So Mr. Ryley, would you like to tell us the whole story? I\u0026rsquo;ve seen photos of your car and looks like someone had his way on it with a sledgehammer, not like it hit a human body.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You underestimate the damage, a human body can cause on a car,\u0026rdquo; came Fred\u0026rsquo;s answer.\nAmanda almost started to laugh as she heard that. The truth was that she had kicked the car into the miserable state it was in now. In fact she hadn\u0026rsquo;t even worn shoes as she had done that, so technically Fred wasn\u0026rsquo;t even lying.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, the human body really is full of surprises sometimes, but your injuries don\u0026rsquo;t match up with the accident you\u0026rsquo;re describing. And even if you were hit by your own car as you describe, who drove it? Why did a woman call the ambulance but didn\u0026rsquo;t wait until it arrived?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why do you care? The whole thing was embarrassing enough, so why are you even more pressing than the cops about this?\u0026rdquo; Fred actually had a point.\n\u0026ldquo;Because you\u0026rsquo;re obviously hiding something,\u0026rdquo; Amanda interrupted. She had come here with the intention of making Fred tell whatever he was hiding from her and she was going to see it through. It would only be suspicious if she suddenly supported him now. Now that she had a few seconds to think over it, if James was with the police, he may already know about Michelle’s actions. She might as well check out how much he knew.\nJames looked at her puzzled. Of course he hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected her to side with him, but since he didn\u0026rsquo;t know their history he quickly accepted her support. Then he answered Fred\u0026rsquo;s original question.\n\u0026ldquo;The police and I have a different viewpoint when it comes to this situation. They only wanted to know whether or not they had to investigate a hit and run. But as long as you claim there was no crime involved - and you seem to have been quite convincing - their job is done. As for me, I\u0026rsquo;m not looking for crimes but for scientifically relevant occurrences. The police tipped me of because they think your incident may be such a case.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda watched Fred\u0026rsquo;s expression intently. Despite his attempts to hide this fact, Amanda noticed her ex-boyfriend\u0026rsquo;s irritation that she had sided with a total stranger against him. And since he clearly knew that she had every reason to be pissed at him, his irritation could only have one - much less rational - reason.\n\u0026ldquo;How exactly can this accident be scientifically relevant?\u0026rdquo; Amanda decided to make sure she played her role as the one who knew nothing about Fred\u0026rsquo;s incident. \u0026ldquo;Even if it was a hit and run, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound too interesting.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, a strange hit and run wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be that important, but I can connect Mr. Ryley to something that is scientifically relevant.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Both Amanda and Fred shouted in unison. Amanda was a bit relieved to see that Fred shared her surprise. Whatever he was hiding from her was rather normal after all.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t really understand this. What kind of occurrence can you connect me to?\u0026rdquo; Fred asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yesterday, there was a bank robbery,\u0026rdquo; James began, only to be cut short by Fred.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re hassling me just because my sister was the hostage in a bank robbery?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda didn\u0026rsquo;t like the sound of this. Had Erika been the hostage that Michelle had saved yesterday?\n\u0026ldquo;Did your sister tell you the whole story?\u0026rdquo; The tone of James voice made it clear he assumed otherwise. To Amanda this just confirmed that James knew about Michelle\u0026rsquo;s actions.\n\u0026ldquo;No, she was a bit pissed when I didn\u0026rsquo;t tell her how \u0026lsquo;this\u0026rsquo; happened.\u0026rdquo; Fred pointed at his knee.\nJames chuckled. \u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t berate you on your communication issues, but you really missed an interesting story.\u0026rdquo; He then turned to Amanda. \u0026ldquo;You said you talked to her earlier. Did she mention anything?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda shook her head. \u0026ldquo;No, she didn\u0026rsquo;t even mention that there was a bank robbery in the first place. What happened?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Something that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t believe if I told you. But since your boyfriend doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to tell me how he broke his knee\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, I get it!\u0026rdquo; Fred blurted out. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you what happened if you tell me how that relates to my sister\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nFred then went on and told him about his encounter with \u0026ldquo;Devil\u0026rdquo;. He actually kept the description of Amanda\u0026rsquo;s alter ego to a minimum, describing her only as a stunningly beautiful woman dressed only in a blue leotard. Amanda suspected that this description would be much more detailed if she weren\u0026rsquo;t there. Now he even missed out her hair color - the main difference between her and Michelle in their super forms. James didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to notice this fact. Other than that, Fred stayed true to the facts. Normally this would have been good news to Amanda. Any more lies would have made it much harder to even consider trusting her ex again. Unfortunately for her, the truth hurt. While it was heartwarming to hear that \u0026ldquo;at that moment, Fred simply wasn\u0026rsquo;t in the mood to flirt, not even with the most beautiful woman on earth\u0026rdquo;, everything that followed was pure torture. Amanda had went over the whole situation many times in her head before, always coming to the conclusion that meeting Fred had already been the worst mistake back then. All the confidence about her new powers couldn\u0026rsquo;t outweigh the anger she felt at him, thus causing her to lose her temper and ultimately hurting him. The problem was, that Fred didn\u0026rsquo;t possess this piece of information. Due to this, Fred\u0026rsquo;s version of her sounded more like a spoiled brat than a grown woman. And he didn\u0026rsquo;t even do it on purpose.\n\u0026ldquo;She just started to trash your car? Just like that?\u0026rdquo; James sounded quite shocked.\n\u0026ldquo;Well I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really polite either,\u0026rdquo; Fred answered.\n\u0026ldquo;That doesn\u0026rsquo;t justify her actions. She stands on your car and talks about messing with you, who would stay polite after that?\u0026rdquo; James turned to Amanda \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t you agree?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda could only nod in reply. The question had taken her off-guard, but luckily she didn\u0026rsquo;t need to speak or lie for this answer.\n\u0026ldquo;See? So how did she break your knee?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It was an accident, actually. She grabbed me by my shirt and flew up a bit. Then my shirt ripped, I fell and my knee didn\u0026rsquo;t like the landing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why do I doubt that it was an accident,\u0026rdquo; James thought aloud. Amanda didn\u0026rsquo;t know what hurt more, the fact that this guy already hated her alter ego or the fact that she couldn\u0026rsquo;t blame him.\n\u0026ldquo;Believe what you want, it was an accident!\u0026rdquo; Fred surprisingly defended Amanda\u0026rsquo;s alter ego. \u0026ldquo;She didn\u0026rsquo;t fake the concern when I fell, and she called the ambulance. If you ask me, she\u0026rsquo;s just inexperienced with these powers.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected this kind of support from the person who had every reason to hate her. She barely hid a smile even though she knew that her current role actually required her to act jealous of herself. Thankfully neither of the men noticed.\n\u0026ldquo;Anyway,\u0026rdquo; Fred continued. \u0026ldquo;Now that you know how I got injured, how about you tell me what\u0026rsquo;s that got to do with my sister?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This woman has appeared a few times over the last few days, saving people from fire, rapists or in case of your sister: bank robbers.\u0026rdquo; James sounded a bit disappointed as he said that. He took out his phone and began typing, eventually handing it over to Fred - who beckoned Amanda over to watch the screen together with him.\nIt was a video that showed the hostage situation Michelle had dealt with yesterday. It played out just as her best friend had described it, making it even harder for Amanda to act surprised. The only surprise for her was that Erika was indeed the hostage there. It was a total coincidence, but this was the reason James was here, after all. Amanda suddenly noticed Fred grabbing her hand. She looked at him only to see that he intently watched the events unfold. He hadn’t even noticed that he had grabbed Amanda’s hand and held it tight. When Erika was threatened at gunpoint, Amanda could feel him trembling on the inside. Seeing someone close to him in a life-threatening situation made him reach for any emotional crutch he could find. Amanda thought it would be tactless to mention now that Fred had lost his holding-hands-privileges during the breakup. In fact, she had her own problems watching the scenes and she had to constantly remind herself that Erika would survive the whole ordeal. When the bank robber finally dropped his gun, both Fred and Amanda let out a small sigh of relief.\nNow Fred realized that he was gripping Amanda\u0026rsquo;s hand and let go with an expression that was somewhere between embarrassment and thankfulness. He started the video again, this time without the tension. Then he paused it so that the freeze frame showed a decent view on Michelle\u0026rsquo;s head and face. The video quality was awful, though.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not her,\u0026rdquo; Fred finally exclaimed.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean? That was totally Erika!\u0026rdquo; Amanda said this in a semi-serious tone. She already knew that Fred was about to clear a different misunderstanding.\n\u0026ldquo;The other woman, it\u0026rsquo;s not the one I encountered.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How so?\u0026rdquo; James asked.\n\u0026ldquo;The one I met was a redhead, this one seems to be blonde. It\u0026rsquo;s be hard to recognize on this black and white video, but it seems like they also have different eye colors.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;According to your sister she had quite remarkable blue eyes. And yes, she\u0026rsquo;s blonde.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then we\u0026rsquo;re talking about two different women. The other one has orange eyes. She really looked like her eyes were on fire.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Two women with superpowers, huh?\u0026rdquo; James let this revelation sink in.\nOf course he was surprised, but Amanda noticed that he also seemed relieved to hear that. This was strange. Amanda had theorized about there being more than just the one plant that gave Michelle and herself superpowers and the possibility wasn\u0026rsquo;t that encouraging.\n\u0026ldquo;You seem happy to hear that,\u0026rdquo; Fred had noticed it too.\n\u0026ldquo;I know, the fact that there\u0026rsquo;s more than one woman with superpowers should be quite scary, but try to see it this way: This blonde woman has shown up several times to help people - like a superhero so to speak. Would you prefer this woman to go around bullying people or would you rather have the bully being a totally different person? This way, Blondie could always step in if the redhead decided to cause real trouble.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aren\u0026rsquo;t you judging her too hard? So far it was just an accident, and she might become a superhero of her own.\u0026rdquo;\nJames nodded, \u0026ldquo;That might be even better, though the only way to find out for sure is to wait and see.\u0026rdquo; Taking his phone back, he turned towards the door. \u0026ldquo;Needless to say that, but I\u0026rsquo;d really prefer you not to run to the next reporter talking about this. The media can turn this whole situation into a big mess if given the chance.\u0026rdquo; With this he left.\nNow that they were alone, an awkward silence followed. During James' presence they had acted as if everything was fine between them, but now it seemed like neither of them knew how to continue from here. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t at all like Amanda expected it to be. Now that she officially knew about Fred\u0026rsquo;s encounter with her alter ego, Amanda would have to pretend to be jealous - of herself. Not to mention the reason they had broken up in the first place: his cheating on her.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you,\u0026rdquo; Fred eventually said.\n\u0026ldquo;For what?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For coming here. It was more than I could ask for.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You may be right about that. But since Erika didn\u0026rsquo;t know how you got injured, I feared it had anything to do with our breakup.\u0026rdquo; The lies she had prepared beforehand came in handy after all. \u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem this way, though.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, this woman came out of nowhere.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really? From how you defended her, it sounded like you were quite fond of her.\u0026rdquo; Amanda almost asked whether she was the one with whom he had betrayed her, but decided against it.\n\u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t deny that, after all she\u0026rsquo;s the reason I wanted to talk to you in the first place.\u0026rdquo; Fred was sounding more and more embarrassed as he said that.\n\u0026ldquo;How is that?\u0026rdquo; For once, Amanda had absolutely no idea what he was getting to, and she feared that maybe he had figured out that she was \u0026lsquo;Devil\u0026rsquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;After the accident, she came visiting me here and apologized about the whole thing. She was really eager about that and I figured that I should follow her example.\u0026rdquo; Fred took a deep breath. \u0026ldquo;It was wrong of me to see another woman behind your back. I betrayed your trust and for that I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. And if there\u0026rsquo;s one thing I regret about the whole thing then it\u0026rsquo;s the fact that I hurt your feelings. You were the one good thing in my life and I\u0026rsquo;ll never forgive myself for hurting you.\u0026rdquo;\nOnce again Amanda was amazed at how she instinctively knew that Fred was telling the truth here. As cliché as his words sounded, they were his true feelings. Yesterday it had been the same, but she had been in her super form back then. She had wondered if this was just another part of her powers, but right now she was normal. Without her powers, this instinctive trust was rather disturbing. Was she just fooling herself?\n\u0026ldquo;Why now?\u0026rdquo; Amanda began. \u0026ldquo;You had your chances to apologize before; I downright asked you if you had anything left to say yesterday. And you declined. So don\u0026rsquo;t tell me that someone else actually needed to show you how to apologize.\u0026rdquo; Amanda was getting louder and louder. \u0026ldquo;Can you imagine how things look from my perspective? I tell you how it looked: It looked like you didn\u0026rsquo;t care about our relationship at all, like nothing had any worth for you. I was just another stupid girl that fell for your lies. It\u0026rsquo;s really hard for me to believe that you regret anything.\u0026rdquo; Or at least it should be.\nFred didn\u0026rsquo;t look into her eyes. Like a scolded boy he sat there and waited for Amanda to finish. He also waited a few seconds before he began his answer - seconds that seemed like eternity for Amanda.\n\u0026ldquo;Just because I didn\u0026rsquo;t show any regret, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any. But I admit that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware just how much all this meant to me. I knew my chances of patching things up were slim - and I suppose they still are. You\u0026rsquo;re not the kind of woman that would simply forgive this whole affair. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t love you if you did. That\u0026rsquo;s why I thought the best course of action would be a clean cut - the sooner we broke up, the sooner we would get over it and could continue with our lives.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So in other words, you gave up before the fight began? I thought you were more of an optimist. What about your affair herself? Where did she fit into your plan?\u0026rdquo;\nFred sighed, naturally this was not his favorite topic. \u0026ldquo;Honestly I didn\u0026rsquo;t have one, as I had no particular feelings for her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No particular feelings?\u0026rdquo; Amanda almost shouted. \u0026ldquo;Then why did you have this affair in the first place?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because she had … connections. There\u0026rsquo;s more than one reason for me not to be proud of this, but the truth is that I used her. I wanted to get something and this affair was the best - well, actually the only - way to get it.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda didn\u0026rsquo;t believe what she heard. \u0026ldquo;Let me ignore how cliché this sounded, what exactly did you want to achieve through her?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Since it was me who betrayed your trust, I can\u0026rsquo;t allow myself to lie to you if I want us to get back together. But this is something I don\u0026rsquo;t want you to know. This is too private.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did I hear this right? You want to make up with me but you want to hide the very reason you cheated on me? How much more selfish can you get? I mean how am I supposed to trust you at all?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I already told you why I cheated on you! All I left out is one detail that I consider too personal for this. Do you really think this detail could make the circumstances any worse?\u0026rdquo;\nThere was something in Fred\u0026rsquo;s voice that disheartened Amanda. He was losing hope about getting back together. After all she hadn\u0026rsquo;t given him any hint that this might work. Perhaps letting him hold her hands and being here in the first place were too subtle for him to notice, not to mention that he didn\u0026rsquo;t have any clue that she felt guilty for his knee.\n\u0026ldquo;I suppose not,\u0026rdquo; Amanda said, calming herself down. \u0026ldquo;But it\u0026rsquo;s a bit hard to imagine a relationship together if you\u0026rsquo;re going to keep secrets from me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I prefer the term privacy; after all I don\u0026rsquo;t know every tiny detail about you either. Some things need time to build up the necessary trust and this is one of them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Could you at least tell me that it\u0026rsquo;s not something illegal?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a jerk, not a criminal.\u0026rdquo; Fred forced himself to chuckle, only to contort his face in pain - his knee didn\u0026rsquo;t like to be moved yet. He then asked the question that tortured them both for the last day. \u0026ldquo;Do you believe there\u0026rsquo;s a future for us?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I doubt things will become exactly the same as before. But I also can\u0026rsquo;t deny the fact that I want things to work out between us as well.\u0026rdquo; Fred\u0026rsquo;s face clearly lightened up upon hearing this. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a free pass for you. We\u0026rsquo;ll take things slowly and you will have some concessions to make of your own.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Like what?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For example I\u0026rsquo;m going to need my share of privacy as well\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe closer evening came, the more Michelle\u0026rsquo;s anticipation was replaced by panic. It began with her eating an early dinner only to remember that her date included dinner in the first place. For a second she wondered if this was some kind of withdrawal symptom as she hadn\u0026rsquo;t been normal for such a long time since her first transformation. But that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case. Sure the idea of drinking the potion and transforming into her superpowered alter ego was as tempting as always, but it wasn’t like she really needed it. No, she had been eating because she was nervous \u0026hellip; and hungry, but that was to be expected. Now she was standing in the shower, trying to get her nervousness under control by thinking about the irony of the situation. Two days ago she had been sure that her next date would be in her super form with her super powers as the ultimate confidence boost. It turned out she could score herself a date just fine even without them. Well… almost. The tiny improvements to her body had helped as well and while she still had no idea how deep these improvements went, she already added heightened sensitivity to the list – the hot water on her skin really felt good. Her super self on the other hand was turned on by the other sex in unexpected ways: by their fists and bullets from their guns. The latter with unexpectedly erotic results. There had been only one instance that could be considered flirting and that was a teenage boy she had saved from a mugging last night. The boy had blatantly asked if he had died and gone to heaven – given the fact that he had been threatened at gunpoint before Michelle’s intervention, he might have believed what he said. Why was such a kid even out at night?\nStepping out of the shower she took a look at the time and learned that she had been showering for almost forty-five minutes. Great, now she had only fifteen more minutes left until James would arrive. In a hurry she began to dry herself. Good thing she had already planned out her outfit for the night: a beautiful red dress that hadn’t fit too well earlier as well as matching red heels. The dress had been a birthday present from Amanda, so instead of changing it, Michelle had intended to lose the few pounds that would make the dress a perfect fit – and she had lost those pounds after transforming back to normal. The shoes were a present from her sister for the same birthday – since she lived in another town, she clearly had cooperated with Amanda. Normally Michelle wasn\u0026rsquo;t the type to wear heels, but today was a special occasion. With the time running short, she didn\u0026rsquo;t have any time to stand around worrying. Ten minutes later she was finished and gave her mirror image a final check. God she looked great. She filled out the dress as if it had been bought specifically for this evening. Her face looked absolutely gorgeous even though she wasn\u0026rsquo;t even wearing any make-up. Only one thing seemed off, but Michelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure it out. Since she managed to be ready before her date arrived, she took a final look at her bedroom to check if there was some evidence she needed to hide. The plant was still hidden in plain sight on her nightstand, since it would only be suspicious to conceal something like this. She spotted her over-sized flip-flops on the floor and proceeded to hide them in her closet along with the other clothes she had bought for her super self. Michelle had long since taken care of any trace of the potion in her room. Her supply was hidden in the fridge and she checked once more for any glass or vial she had used to transform - only to confirm that she had indeed washed all of them. Then she noticed her glasses that laid unused on her nightstand.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my god,\u0026rdquo; Michelle whispered to herself. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t even noticed that she had forgotten to put on her glasses because she had no trouble seeing. With shaking hands she tried to put them on. As her vision got blurry she immediately took them back off. It was official: she wasn\u0026rsquo;t near-sighted anymore. As great as that was, why did it have to happen now, right before a ding dong date? No use in fretting over it now. As she headed to the door, she took one last glance at the mirror. Brown. At least the color of her eyes was still as it should be. As she walked to the door she felt herself getting nervous again and she calmed herself down that being in better condition than expected couldn\u0026rsquo;t be a bad thing. Once she had opened the door, her nervousness had all but disappeared. James had taken things just as seriously as she, and Michelle had to admit that he looked great in a suit. He really looked like a guy that could walk into a bar and leave it with a woman in each arm - if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for the dumbfounded look on his face that made it really obvious that he liked what he saw. Who needed superpowers as a confidence boost if she could render a handsome guy like him speechless?\n\u0026ldquo;Wow … uhm, I mean hi.\u0026rdquo; James' face turned bright red as he struggled for words. He cleared his throat before finally making any decent sense. \u0026ldquo;Sorry about that, I was just astounded by how great you look.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you. You look nice as well,\u0026rdquo; Michelle said with the most charming smile. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t nervous anymore. This was going to be fun.\nAmanda looked around the bar Erika had dragged her to. It was still early in the evening, so there weren\u0026rsquo;t many customers besides them. Erika had arrived at Fred\u0026rsquo;s hospital room shortly after he and Amanda had agreed to give their relationship another chance. She quickly accepted this turn of events, but she seemed a bit wary about it as well. Things turned a bit awkward when Fred and Erika exchanged their stories about their encounter with Super Amanda and Super Michelle. Like James before, Erika didn\u0026rsquo;t really have a high opinion about Super Amanda. She became understandably irritated that her brother seemed to defend the woman who was responsible for his condition. Especially in front of his girlfriend. Fred used this opportunity to explain how this incident had given him a second chance with Amanda, causing the latter to exclaim that she was right there. Thankfully the discussion then shifted more towards Erika\u0026rsquo;s role as a hostage and Michelle\u0026rsquo;s intervention about it. When Amanda excused herself to leave, Erika had surprisingly accompanied her \u0026lsquo;to have a chat\u0026rsquo;.\nNow they were sitting in a booth at a bar waiting for their drinks. Amanda wondered about Erika\u0026rsquo;s motivation - fearing that the other woman had drawn the painfully obvious conclusion that the \u0026ldquo;evil redhead\u0026rdquo; had acted far too much like a pissed ex-girlfriend not to be suspicious about Amanda and him making up afterwards. On the other hand, Amanda had a few questions for Erika as well. Whatever it was that Fred was hiding from her, Erika was the only person besides himself that might know about it. Once again, Amanda noticed the tired look in Erika\u0026rsquo;s eyes. Considering what the other woman had been through, this was absolutely understandable.\n\u0026ldquo;I have to admit I\u0026rsquo;m a bit surprised that you actually showed up at the hospital, not to mention forgiving him,\u0026rdquo; Erika began. \u0026ldquo;Actually, I thought you were too proud to overlook something like this. What changed your mind?\u0026rdquo;\nSo she was suspicious after all.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t really get it myself. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because of his condition, but his apology sounded really sincere. I know it sounds naïve, but only time will tell if we really get back together or whether we\u0026rsquo;re just prolonging the inevitable.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did he … tell you why he cheated on you?\u0026rdquo; Erika sounded more curious than testing here.\n\u0026ldquo;Only partially. He said he wanted to use her connections, but not what for. Do you believe that? He said it was too personal for him, after he cheated on me!\u0026rdquo; Amanda thought it would be best to be direct. \u0026ldquo;Do you know anything more about that?\u0026rdquo;\nErika shook her head. \u0026ldquo;I knew nothing about the whole affair.\u0026rdquo; She took a sip from her drink. \u0026ldquo;But the fact that he\u0026rsquo;s so secretive about it narrows it down.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So you know what he\u0026rsquo;s hiding from me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You could say that. There\u0026rsquo;s only one thing that he really didn\u0026rsquo;t want you to know.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And what would that be?\u0026rdquo;\nErika gave out a loud sigh. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t dig any further. If he says it\u0026rsquo;s too personal then you should respect that. Build up the necessary trust for him to tell you, if you\u0026rsquo;re really interested.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hello? He cheated on me! Don\u0026rsquo;t I get any credit for that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It’s a bit more complicated than that. Fred hates being pitied and he’s fully aware that his current state encourages this. In a way, he’s swallowing his pride here, too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You’re not seriously comparing these two, are you? I mean ‘being pitied’ isn’t exactly a deal breaker like cheating is.\u0026rdquo; Amanda then remembered a conversation she had with Fred before. \u0026ldquo;Wait, do you want to imply that his \u0026lsquo;breaking up because she was overprotective\u0026rsquo; story is real?\u0026rdquo;\nErika blinked a few times, showing that she was surprised. \u0026ldquo;He told you about this?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, a few months ago when he had the flu. I thought this was just a joke to prevent me from nursing him too much. Did he really break up with a girl because she went overboard when it came to nursing him?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, yeah. But she really had it coming. She tried to nurse him, even when he was fine.\u0026rdquo; Erika took a deep breath. \u0026ldquo;What I wanted to say is that you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t exaggerate his condition. Don\u0026rsquo;t give the impression that you only made up with him because of that and you should be fine.\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda sighed. Now she had to downplay an injury she herself had caused.\nThe date was going great from James' perspective. They had reached the restaurant without any complications, chit-chatting the whole way. Once they had taken their seats and placed their orders, their conversations drifted to their jobs.\n\u0026ldquo;… long story short, I\u0026rsquo;m an assistant,\u0026rdquo; Michelle finished her rather long job description.\n\u0026ldquo;So, technically you\u0026rsquo;re a full-fledged reporter, but you don\u0026rsquo;t actually appear on TV? Why is that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m quite shy and when I started, other candidates proved more useful in front of the camera. So I settled for the second row.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you have any intention of changing that? You don\u0026rsquo;t seem that shy to me and I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;d make a great anchorwoman.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle blushed and looked away, all while trying to hide her smile. God, she\u0026rsquo;s adorable when she\u0026rsquo;s embarrassed. James couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but smile as well.\n\u0026ldquo;I did think about it, of course. But after a while I got used to my job and thanks to recent events I\u0026rsquo;m really not interested in this kind of promotion anymore.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What recent events are you talking about?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The meteor scare of course. Can you imagine how it felt to see my colleagues adding fuel to the fire by concentrating on the worst case scenario which ended up being missed by several miles?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh yeah right, the media wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly helpful back then. But wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that encourage you to change the way information is handled?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Easier said than done. When the whole industry only seeks sensation it becomes hard to change it all by yourself.”\nJames could easily empathize with her; after all he had a few things he didn’t like about his own job as well.\n“How about yourself?” Michelle suddenly continued. “What does a scientific consultant for the police actually do when he’s not knocking on my door on a Sunday morning?”\n\u0026ldquo;Oh that\u0026rsquo;s simple. When the police finds something out of the ordinary, they call me to check whether it really is.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Out of the ordinary? Did they expect small green men to come out of the meteor?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, but the public already feared that a rock from outer space could bring the end of the world. The program is more to calm it down, actually. Unfortunately, this means most of my cases are downright boring and the police used this fact to get some additional tests done that they can\u0026rsquo;t do due to budget or time constraints.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound too bad,\u0026rdquo; Michelle said. \u0026ldquo;My superiors would turn it into a corruption scandal, though.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why is that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re doing work meant for the police while neglecting your own - that\u0026rsquo;s the part that they would focus on. The fact that your job consists of helping the police would mean nothing to them.\u0026rdquo;\nJames suddenly felt anxious. \u0026ldquo;And what is your opinion about that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Me? Well, you\u0026rsquo;re doing your job and by assisting the police you\u0026rsquo;re actually doing a public service, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to find anything wrong with that. The only \u0026lsquo;out of the ordinary\u0026rsquo; case I know about is some boulder that had been moved. By the way, are there any news on that one?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; A sudden shudder went over James. He did have a theory about how that boulder got moved, but it might be a big mistake to share it with Michelle. She was part of the media after all. Spreading the news of superpowered women flying around would be just another day at work for her - not to mention a boost for her career. And he would be the security leak. This was one big dilemma. Until now everything had went great between Michelle and him, he honestly believed that there was some kind of connection between them. Still there was the possibility that those feelings were one-sided on his part and that she was merely using him. No! He needed to get rid of this paranoid thinking as soon as possible or otherwise it would poison the whole evening. \u0026ldquo;… I\u0026rsquo;m still operating on the \u0026lsquo;a person lifted it\u0026rsquo; theory.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought you said this boulder was too heavy to be lifted without proper equipment.\u0026rdquo; James was surprised that, instead of laughing at such an outlandish idea, Michelle asked in barely a whisper.\n\u0026ldquo;Let me show you,\u0026rdquo; there was only one way to go for James, but this didn\u0026rsquo;t make him feel any better about it. He took out his smartphone and began looking for the video file that would explain his theory. Once he had found it, he presented it to Michelle.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t like it had been this afternoon where he had presented this video to a couple that had already heard about the existence of superpowers before. Hell, the man had even met one of them before. James watched as Michelle\u0026rsquo;s eyes stayed fixated on the small screen in her hand. Concern was written all over her face. This was to be expected; after all she didn\u0026rsquo;t know that the hostage would survive.\n\u0026ldquo;Why are you showing this to me?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked in a shaky voice once she was done watching.\n\u0026ldquo;You asked about the boulder, right? My theory is that she - or someone like her - moved it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;S-someone like her?\u0026rdquo; Michelle seemed like she was about to freak out. \u0026ldquo;Are there more like her around?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s been word of a redheaded woman,\u0026rdquo; again James was surprised at his own honesty. He realized that while he didn\u0026rsquo;t know whether or not he could trust her, this honesty could come back to bite him. \u0026ldquo;Excuse me for a second.\u0026rdquo;\nJames then stood up and made his way to the bathroom, leaving his phone with the compromising video behind.\nSitting alone at the table, Michelle\u0026rsquo;s tried to organize her panicked thoughts. How much did he know? Why did he even tell her about such an important discovery? Just because she asked? No, he most likely suspected her already; this was the most logical explanation. Did he just want her to make a mistake that proved his suspicions? It didn\u0026rsquo;t feel that way. Actually it felt more like it was quite the opposite, like he didn\u0026rsquo;t want her to confirm his fears. Michelle hadn\u0026rsquo;t missed that James was nervous. In fact his nervousness had been contagious as it was the main reason she was nervous as well. Michelle noticed that James' phone was still lying in front of her. She wished she could just delete this video of her and be done with this story. But she knew things wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be so easy. Sooner or later her actions would become public knowledge. It was a miracle that this video hadn\u0026rsquo;t made it to the news yet. Most of her colleagues would simply take the camera or copy the file to present it to the world. Michelle was pretty sure that even if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t her on the video, she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to spread this news. Maybe she could convince James not to show it to anybody he met. It would calm her down if he agreed, after all.\nJames splashed cold water on his face. He had barely managed to set a trap that would decide whether or not Michelle was trustworthy - or if he had already screwed up by showing her the video. Thankfully he had some nasty surprises hidden on his phone that would make any attempt to copy the video file futile. The only way to publish this video was to steal the phone right now - in which case Michelle wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be waiting for him at the table anymore. And if she was, a quick check on his phone would prove whether she had tried to copy it. He had made these precautions more out of legal reasons, so that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t become a security leak should he lose his phone. To think that it would help him ease his unreasonable paranoia had a certain irony to it.\nJames returned to their table and smiled once he spotted Michelle still sitting there. Once he sat down, he picked up his phone and checked the file - and his smile grew even broader. Why had he even thought this woman was capable of something so underhanded?\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the good news?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I just noticed that you\u0026rsquo;re just as nice as you look.\u0026rdquo; Okay, that one was cheesy, but Michelle blushed nonetheless. \u0026ldquo;You didn\u0026rsquo;t try to copy this video file, meaning that showing it to you wasn\u0026rsquo;t a mistake.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s good to hear,\u0026rdquo; Michelle indeed seemed to be relieved. James was just happy that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t offended by him fearing such things. \u0026ldquo;I already wondered why you showed me such delicate information in the first place. Do you have any idea what would happen if this got published?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve given it some thought, but in the end there are too many unknown variables. The most important part would be the \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; it\u0026rsquo;s published. And the meteor scare was a good demonstration of how not to. If this woman continues like this, she will sooner or later become public knowledge. It\u0026rsquo;ll depend on how good a job she does to determine whether she inspires hope or fear.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s your opinion about her, then?\u0026rdquo;\nJames hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected to hear this particular question. It seemed strange to talk about a totally different woman on a date, especially if he didn\u0026rsquo;t know that other woman.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a bit unreal that there\u0026rsquo;s a real person that seems to be more fitting for a comic book than reality. But from what I heard so far, she really seems to fit the term superhero, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you think?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no arguing on the \u0026lsquo;super\u0026rsquo; part, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think she should be called a hero yet. From what I see, there\u0026rsquo;s no actual danger for her during the whole fight. Her priority should have been the safety of the hostages, but instead she went after the criminals first. You can clearly see that she screwed up the moment the hostage got retaken. It was written all over her face.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You may be right, but things aren\u0026rsquo;t as easy as they are in fiction. Getting the hostage to safety sounds easier than it might be, so maybe attacking the kidnappers first was the best chance she had?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And if she had a better way but didn\u0026rsquo;t use it?\u0026rdquo;\nJames shrugged his shoulders. \u0026ldquo;Everybody makes mistakes, I guess. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it would be that good to openly point them out. The point is that she wanted to help and succeeded. She\u0026rsquo;s basically doing a public service, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to find anything wrong about that.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle turned her head away as she blushed once again. She must have recognized that he had returned her own statement about his work to her.\n\u0026ldquo;I take it you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of hers, then.\u0026rdquo;\nJames had to gulp hard. This was the most dangerous question she could\u0026rsquo;ve asked, and that slight smirk that was still on her face made it clear that she knew this. She was messing with him!\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to use the term \u0026lsquo;fan\u0026rsquo; here as I don\u0026rsquo;t really know that much about her. She\u0026rsquo;s flying around helping people and unlike the police, I don\u0026rsquo;t see her as a problem.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So the police doesn\u0026rsquo;t like her?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not her specifically, but the idea that there are people with superpowers can become quite disturbing. And while this woman really seems use her powers for good, others may not be that nice.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If there are others, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There are. I mentioned a redhead before who may be connected to her. She\u0026rsquo;s only appeared once so far and even the victim admits it was an accident. But even if she\u0026rsquo;s nicer than expected, the fact that there are two of them increases the chances that there are even more.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see, so the cops are more concerned that there may be a criminal with these powers. Can\u0026rsquo;t blame them for that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s just hope those two women are the only ones.\u0026rdquo; James thought about the dead prostitute and how she would fit into the story. Then he realized that their conversation had become quite serious and that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly the mood he had intended for this evening.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you have any theory as to how they got their powers?\u0026rdquo; Michelle seemed to enjoy this topic, though. \u0026ldquo;Could it be related to the meteor?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got no idea,\u0026rdquo; James admitted. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to receive the report as to what they found out about the meteor, but I doubt this will make any change. The best way to find out might be the woman herself, but that\u0026rsquo;s not going to be easy. Well, there\u0026rsquo;s still the autopsy.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What autopsy?\u0026rdquo;\nJames wanted to mentally kick himself for even mentioning it, but found that he had begun to trust Michelle and valued her opinion.\n\u0026ldquo;The police found a drug victim that turned out to be somehow mutated. Her DNA contained many more chromosomes than the human DNA was supposed to have. A comparison with old hair of hers showed that she originally possessed the 23 pairs normal for humans, but at the time of her death possessed 27 additional pairs.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Any idea about what these extra chromosomes do?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;None so far. The only outward sign was that she looked much more - uhm - healthy than she was supposed to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And by healthy you mean more attractive?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Both. She had been a drug addict for quite some time, and it showed in past photos. The corpse I saw didn\u0026rsquo;t show any signs of this, as if she had been at perfect health again. It seemed like her drug history had been cleared from her body - which most likely caused her death.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Any idea how that happened?\u0026rdquo; Michelle now sounded really concerned.\nAgain, James had to shrug his shoulders. \u0026ldquo;Your guess is as good as mine. My first idea was that it was caused by some kind of drugs. There\u0026rsquo;s no hint so far that it\u0026rsquo;s connected to the two superpowered women\u0026rdquo; He tried to sound as convincing as possible, as he could see Michelle becoming more and more anxious - something he instinctively wanted to prevent. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s change the subject, shall we? It\u0026rsquo;s kind of awkward to talk about other women when the most beautiful woman in the world sits right in front of me.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle rewarded his compliment with a smile.\nAmanda entered her apartment with a loud sigh. Her head hurt like hell and Amanda knew full well why it did so. She had planned to make Erika spill the oh-so-big secret she and Fred were keeping from her, by getting her drunk. Normally, this would be a futile effort as Erika could hold her liquor quite well. Amanda had thought that increased resistance to alcohol would be one of the many tiny improvements she had been subjected to. And technically she was right, just not in the way she had expected. It took her only one drink to realize that she was getting drunk faster than she normally would. Her body processed the alcohol much faster, which included a fast approaching hangover. Of course, her plan to get Erika drunk was doomed to fail this way. Amanda considered herself lucky that Erika hadn\u0026rsquo;t noticed her condition; after all she didn\u0026rsquo;t need any more suspicion from her. Now she was at her apartment and her hangover hit her with full force. It was tempting to skip her suffering by drinking the super potion, but the last time she had done so had ended badly, so she would have to wait it through. After all, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t take that long for her to recover and she wanted to prove to herself that she wasn\u0026rsquo;t reliant of the super potion.\nTime sure flew by for Michelle and eventually she stared dumbfounded at her finished dessert, realizing that their dinner was about to end. She took a glance at James, who seemed to have similar thoughts. Except for the short moment where both of them had been almost afraid of each other, they had a really good time together. In fact, Michelle had absolutely no doubt that James dreaded the end of this evening just as much as she did. Now that she thought about it, it was a bit strange that she was so confident in knowing how James felt. This reminded her of how Amanda had claimed to know for a fact that Fred hadn\u0026rsquo;t been lying about still loving her. It had sounded like wishful thinking back then, but right now Michelle understood what her best friend had meant. She felt somehow connected to James, and began to wonder if it was more than just a metaphor. Amanda\u0026rsquo;s words were echoing in her mind: \u0026lsquo;Just be yourself and determine whether or not you love him. If you do, and he loves you too, then you should tell him asap.\u0026rsquo; Why did this pop up in her head now? Not too long ago, she had been scared of him finding out and now she was … curious.\n\u0026ldquo;About these superpowered women, you mentioned earlier. What is your job about them exactly?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Officially I\u0026rsquo;m researching everything out of the ordinary, which includes them, of course.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, you\u0026rsquo;re hunting them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what it boils down to. Chances of success are slim enough for my superiors to \u0026lsquo;entrust\u0026rsquo; this job to me and in case I do find something, they\u0026rsquo;ll just let someone else handle it.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle could clearly feel his anger over this situation and she had no trouble sympathizing with him about it.\n\u0026ldquo;That sounds quite demotivating. How do you keep yourself going?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Curiosity,\u0026rdquo; James didn\u0026rsquo;t even have to think for this answer. \u0026ldquo;I became a scientist because of that and nobody can argue that my job has its exciting parts now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But it sounds futile if you\u0026rsquo;re not really able to research anything,\u0026rdquo; Michelle retorted. \u0026ldquo;What good is it to track something down if someone else steals the glory afterwards?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good thing I\u0026rsquo;ve got a certain amount of freedom, then. After all, they can\u0026rsquo;t take away information that I already possess. They may have cut me off the mutated drug-addict, but I do know a few things about her - not to mention my connection to the police. They also know that there was a moved boulder in the mountains and that it was most likely moved by this blonde superchick, but I may have forgotten to mention the pajama pants that led me to you.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen he put it that way, it was a damn miracle that he still hadn\u0026rsquo;t at least considered her to be involved.\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, I really appreciate that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It was nothing and it would\u0026rsquo;ve left a bad first impression to draw any unnecessary attention towards you. You deserve better.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle blushed at the honesty of that comment, and the unspoken affection that had caused him to act that way. He mainly wanted to help her - and he hadn\u0026rsquo;t even intended to tell her this. The fact that she was above suspicion for him had played only a very small part in James not mentioning her to his superiors compared to this. Michelle also realized that the only reason she was above suspicion, were the radically different looks between her normal form and her super form. James simply hadn\u0026rsquo;t considered the possibility that there was a physical transformation involved that turned her body into a living wet dream. One good thing about him not knowing her secret was that he didn\u0026rsquo;t fall for her just for her super looks. Unable to hide her happiness about this, Michelle began to smile even more.\nGod, she\u0026rsquo;s adorable when she smiles.\nWhat was that? Michelle looked surprised at James, who was just in the process of drinking. It had sounded like his voice, but he clearly hadn\u0026rsquo;t spoken. Must\u0026rsquo;ve been someone else.\nJames paid for the meal and the two of them made their way back to his car. Neither of them said a word during the drive. Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t really pay attention to the road as she watched James from the side. He was focused on the traffic and used it as a means to ignore his nervousness. Her heart began to beat faster as she realized just how much he wanted this drive to last longer, to make a detour just to spend more time with her. But doing so, would startle her and so he did the only thing he could do, to prolong it: drive slowly. Fate was on his side as there was no free space before her apartment for him to park - or stop.\n\u0026ldquo;Seems like you\u0026rsquo;ll have to park a little further away and walk me to my doorstep,\u0026rdquo; Michelle teased.\nJames did as he was told - with a broad grin on his face that he thought invisible due to the darkness in the car. Once they had left the car, Michelle seized the opportunity and grabbed his arm so that they walked arm in arm. With great joy she remembered the couples she had watched on her first night on patrol. Right now she had no reason to be envious of them.\n\u0026ldquo;Well,\u0026rdquo; James began as they had reached the door. \u0026ldquo;I \u0026hellip;uh\u0026hellip; had a really good time tonight. I mean, you\u0026rsquo;re a fascinating woman, that\u0026hellip; no, what I wanted to say is\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle interrupted James helpless stammering by gently putting her index finger onto his mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;You seem at a loss for words right now, so let me do the talking. I also had a fun time tonight and I\u0026rsquo;d like to repeat it rather sooner than later. Yes, I know you were going to ask me that, because you\u0026rsquo;re so much of a nice guy that you\u0026rsquo;d rather ask this instead of what you really want to ask. So instead of trying to come up with the right words how about you try to come up with the right actions?\u0026rdquo;\nEven though it sounded as if James had a choice, the reality was that Michelle already had made it for him. As she spoke, her face had steadily gotten closer to his and in the end her finger seemed the only thing separating their mouths from each other. With their faces so close, they stared each other in the eyes. Michelle teased him for a little longer, savoring his undivided attention before finally removing her finger. Immediately their lips met and for Michelle this moment was magical. Never before in her life had she felt this happy - and considering the recent events in her life this really meant something. A stream of emotions washed over her. Michelle suddenly saw pictures of herself from another person’s view. From the angle it seemed like the other person was at least a foot taller than her, but Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t even need this information to realize that she was somehow seeing flashes of James' memories. Besides a few flashes that must\u0026rsquo;ve been from their initial encounter yesterday, all of them were from this evening - including the very moment before their kiss. In this memory she seemed equal in height- a sign that reading his mind and feelings wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only extraordinary thing Michelle was doing right now. Under normal circumstances these news would have been the focus of her attention. But right now, while she literally tasted his affections that only added to her own, Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t care about petty things like how she wasn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to have any powers right now. And so the fact that she was hovering a foot above the floor remained unnoticed by the two lovers who had only one thing in their mind: Them.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part07/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 07"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"The blonde woman hovered above the city trying to find an opportunity to put her superpowers to good use. It had been just over ten minutes since she left the parking block.\nMichelle sighed. She was trying to get the hostage situation behind her by finding something else to do, but once again the young woman was reminded of the fact that such an opportunity wouldn’t arise just because she wanted to.\nEven though she could see the entire city from her vantage point, Michelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t see all the minute details at once. If she focused on a certain place with her super vision, she naturally ignored pretty much everything else\u0026hellip; a bit disappointing, really. Then again her super eyesight was much more than any human could dream of – not to mention that she was near-sighted in her normal form. When her gaze fell on Amanda’s apartment, Michelle remembered that she had an appointment with her best friend and decided that this was as good a time as any to drop by.\nOne second was all it took to reach her best friend’s apartment. Nobody in the neighborhood was able to spot the blonde goddess who had just descended. Amanda herself was no exception, and she all but screamed in surprise as Michelle suddenly appeared in her living room.\n“Don’t startle me like that!\u0026quot; she said as she overcame the shock.\n“The window was open, so I figured you were expecting me.” Michelle said, crossing the arms in front of her chest, which only showcased the increased bust size she sported in her super form. “By the way, nice hair!”\nAmanda’s hair had indeed changed since the last time they met. Earlier - in her super form - she had sported flaming red hair (and a matching set of orange eyes to boot) while now it was blonde, similar to Michelle’s own. This wouldn’t be too much of a surprise considering that before Amanda had drunk the strange liquid and transformed into a super powered goddess just like Michelle herself was right now, she had been blonde too. The difference was that Amanda had been a natural brunette who had only dyed her hair blonde. For some reason her natural hair color had changed.\n\u0026ldquo;Just trying a new color\u0026rdquo; was Amanda’s answer – obviously her excuse for whoever would recognize the changes. The tone of her voice made it also clear that she liked the outcome of her first transformation.\nMichelle also noticed some other smaller changes on Amanda’s body. Her best friend had slimmed down a bit, while her muscles seemed slightly more defined and her breasts a tiny bit bigger. Michelle was surprised at how well she recognized these changes as they were almost invisible. And here she had been disappointed in the limits of her superior eyesight before. The more she looked at her friend, the more Michelle became aware just how deep-rooted the changes made by that super serum had been. Originally Michelle had considered these changes to her ‘normal’ self to be purely cosmetic in nature, but her second transformation had already made it obvious that this wasn’t the case. Unlike the first transformation this one – and every transformation thereafter – had been entirely pleasurable, without any sign of dizziness or pain.\n“How do you feel?”\n“Huh?” Amanda was clearly surprised by this question. “I feel fine… I guess. Compared to this morning, I feel absolutely terrific, but compared an hour ago it sure is a downgrade. Then again I also had this habit of not keeping my feet on the ground whenever I could.”\nMichelle smiled. Earlier Amanda had been quite depressed and barely used her powers when she had them. This had been because of her confrontation with her ex-boyfriend which didn’t end too well. It seemed like somewhere along the way, Amanda had started to enjoy the upsides of having superpowers. Michelle knew firsthand that being able to fly was definitely one of them. She had no intention of touching the floor of Amanda’s apartment for now.\n“I assume that things went well with Fred?” asked Michelle.\n“Something like that. Of course he wasn’t exactly happy to see ‘super me’ again, but eventually accepted my apology. And then he told ‘super me’ that he loves ‘normal me’. Can you believe it? He didn’t even manage the slightest apology for cheating on me but then talked like he made the biggest mistake of his life to what he thought was a complete stranger.” Amanda looked sideways, clearly irritated. “The worst part is that with all his lies, I absolutely know he was telling the truth.”\n“Are you sure?” Michelle secretly wondered how Amanda could be sure that his love for her was no lie.\n“Well, he tried to. He claimed he wanted to sell his car, but I know him well enough to say that he wouldn’t do that. No, my guess is that he needs the money. Now the question is: Why didn’t he tell me about his financial problems?”\n“Maybe there was something illegal going on and he didn’t want you to get caught up in it?”\nAmanda chuckled. “That’s so cliché that it was the first thing that came to my mind as well. It sure makes sense but only for ‘normal me’. If you’re somehow threatened by criminals and have a superwoman asking for a way to repay you, you simply send her after the criminals instead of trying to get the money, right?”\nMichelle nodded affirmatively.\n“So that means he needs money for something not illegal. But why didn’t he tell me about it? I mean I was his girlfriend, why wouldn’t he trust me with his problems?”\nThe situation was getting uncomfortable for Michelle. It seemed like Amanda was more offended by the fact that her ex-boyfriend had lied to her than the fact that he had cheated on her. Maybe this was her guilt speaking: it was Amanda’s fault that he was hospitalized after all.\n“Maybe that other woman knows…” Amanda was more thinking aloud than talking to Michelle right now. “But then, why would he try to make up with me now?”\n“Wait! When did that happen?” Michelle was clearly surprised.\n“I had barely transformed back when he called. He said he wants to talk to me once I feel better. He still thinks I’m sick and didn’t mention that he was hospitalized. When I’m going to meet him tomorrow, he better have a good explanation for all this. Otherwise he won’t get a second chance.”\nMichelle felt a wave of relief. Normally Amanda wouldn’t even consider giving him a second chance, something that she had been quite proud of. It would be strange for her to simply forgive Fred his faults, even though Amanda had made a mistake of her own. No, this mistake was most likely the reason he was – possibly – the exception to Amanda’s rule.\n“So what are your plans for him now?”\n“Well first, I’m going to meet him tomorrow and then I’ll demand an explanation for his cheating. Hopefully he’ll somehow mention his financial problems. If he doesn’t I’ll have to rely on ‘super me’ to get this bit of information. Having a secret identity has its advantages after all.”\n“Sounds like a plan.”\nAmanda simply nodded – seemingly waiting for Michelle’s next question. A question that didn’t come. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Amanda asked a question of her own.\n“Now that we talked about my problems, what exactly was on your mind when I we met earlier?”\n“Um…” Michelle hesitated, embarrassed at how small her biggest problem seemed compared to what Amanda was going through. “Well… there’s this guy…”\nJames hadn’t expected much of the dead prostitute\u0026rsquo;s place and was actually surprised when he actually saw it. It was basically just one room with a tiny bathroom, and the only noteworthy thing was its relative cleanliness. Even though the whole place was a bit filthy, it was apparent that its sole inhabitant had tried to keep the place as clean as possible. If her diary was to be believed, she had only started to do so the day before she died. For the whole ride here, James had read through this woman\u0026rsquo;s diary trying to find a clue about what had happened to her. The diary had been one of the few things the police had confiscated in order to solve this case. James couldn\u0026rsquo;t blame them. The cause of death had been obvious, and the only mystery was the healthy look the woman sported. This raised the idea of her being a similar looking woman taking over the former\u0026rsquo;s identity, but a DNA test only confused the issue further. Now James and Detective Jacob Spencer were looking for a clue as to why the dead woman somehow possessed many more chromosomes than any other human.\nThe diary itself hadn\u0026rsquo;t been of too much help, though. This poor woman\u0026rsquo;s life had been a mess, and the diary made it clear that she had been aware of that. Whenever she was sober enough, her entries were simply depressing, trying to describe the vicious cycle her life had been. There were also entries that described her various drug trips. If the answer to her strange mutation was hidden in there, James was maybe literally searching for a needle in a stack of needles. That\u0026rsquo;s why he hoped to find a clue at her place.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, tell me. What exactly are we looking for?\u0026rdquo; Detective Spencer finally asked. \u0026ldquo;What could cause this strange mutation you\u0026rsquo;ve described?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the million dollar question. I have no idea what could cause it and the only effect we\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far might be her significantly healthier state – which ironically killed her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If that\u0026rsquo;s the only effect of – whatever this is – then I\u0026rsquo;m sure everybody would want to get some of that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I seriously doubt it. Too bad we won\u0026rsquo;t be able to see any other effects with patient zero being dead.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of weird effects, do you think this is connected to the flying woman rumors I told you about earlier today?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Beats me. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to consider such rumors until I see at least some proof. Something like a convincing photo or something.\u0026rdquo;\nDetective Spencer\u0026rsquo;s cell phone suddenly started to ring, abruptly pausing their conversation. James used the opportunity to give the place another once-over. Why did this woman start to clean up at such an inconvenient moment? The original idea was that there were different women involved and the new one wanted to settle in accordingly, but this wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily the case. Wait, maybe this cleaning session had also been caused by her improved health? The diary downright stated, that she felt great and wanted to start fresh. This would at least narrow down the moment when exactly the first effects were visible. Maybe the autopsy would give a bit more insight\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Really? You\u0026rsquo;re not kidding?\u0026rdquo; Jacob sounded really excited about whatever was the topic of his phone call. \u0026ldquo;Alright, we\u0026rsquo;ll be over there in a minute.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Something interesting?\u0026rdquo; It didn\u0026rsquo;t look like this place contained any further clue anyway.\n\u0026ldquo;You could say that. I call your convincing photo and raise you security footage.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What? You mean\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, seems like there is a flying woman out there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe this!\u0026rdquo; Amanda exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;And here I thought the strangest thing that happened today would be me going against my plan and drinking that super potion. Now I hear that you\u0026rsquo;ve got yourself a date!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;When you put it that way, it really sounds embarrassing,\u0026rdquo; Michelle answered. She was sitting cross-legged on Amanda\u0026rsquo;s couch since the latter had gotten irritated by her constant hovering.\n\u0026ldquo;Well your private life wasn\u0026rsquo;t much to speak of, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe you flirted at all, not to mention successfully and with a cute guy on top of that. I just can\u0026rsquo;t imagine you taking the initiative.\u0026rdquo; Amanda paused for a second. \u0026ldquo;Not in your normal form at least. You sure you weren\u0026rsquo;t super?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Absolutely, I transformed back just half an hour earlier. But the real problem is his occupation. This guy tracked me down by the pajama pants I wore during my first transformation. He might actually figure out about my powers. What am I going to do about that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just be yourself and determine whether or not you love him. If you do, and he loves you too, then you should tell him asap.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why asap? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t I wait until I\u0026rsquo;m absolutely sure that he won\u0026rsquo;t put me into some government lab to be experimented on?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The longer you wait to come clean, the higher the chance he\u0026rsquo;ll see through it and the more he\u0026rsquo;ll be pissed off when he does. Trust me, I speak out of experience.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So not only do I have to correctly judge his character, but I\u0026rsquo;m also operating on a deadline? Great, now I\u0026rsquo;m really anxious about the whole deal.\u0026rdquo; Still, a part of her couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait for the date.\n\u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t that exactly what dating is about?\u0026rdquo; said Amanda. \u0026ldquo;By the way, you\u0026rsquo;re doing it again.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle looked down and realized that she subconsciously had begun to float again, now hovering a few inches above the couch.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the matter with you? Yesterday you had no problem with me flying, but now you\u0026rsquo;re all \u0026lsquo;keep your feet on the ground!'\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um\u0026hellip; well,\u0026rdquo; Amanda started to stammer. Yesterday she had been clearly intimidated as well as fascinated by Michelle\u0026rsquo;s display of power. Right now things were different with Amanda being annoyed about it, but Michelle had a feeling, she already knew why. After all, she hadn\u0026rsquo;t been as intimidated by Amanda\u0026rsquo;s super form when she had shown up at Michelle\u0026rsquo;s place earlier, though Amanda\u0026rsquo;s lack of confidence had helped as well.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, I admit it,\u0026rdquo; Amanda finally blurted out. \u0026ldquo;When you made me fly yesterday it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel that good. But now that I know how great it feels to fly under my own power, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but want to be super, too.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And what\u0026rsquo;s keeping you?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked. \u0026ldquo;You do have a few doses of the potion here, after all.\u0026rdquo;\n“I don’t know. It kind of feels weird to transform again after what happened the first time.” Amanda’s head sunk lower.\nThe sight of her friend being trapped between her desire and her guilt somehow reminded Michelle of the hostage situation from before.\n“Hey, let me tell you a bit about what happened before I got here\u0026hellip;”\nNeither James nor Jacob believed their eyes, as they watched the security camera footage. Just as the rumors said it was a blonde woman in a black leotard, and she was clearly flying as she approached the bank robbers who had just abandoned their hostage. James cursed the low quality of the footage. In times of high definition and 3D, he was watching one of the most important discoveries with neither sound nor color. Now the first one was knocked out and the other two would use their guns to deal with her - only to find out that she\u0026rsquo;s bulletproof. Then one of them would try to punch her and break his hand in the process\u0026hellip; This wasn\u0026rsquo;t their first time watching the footage, and James had already memorized what would happen next. It still was hard to believe that this really happened.\nThis blonde woman could fly, was bulletproof if not downright invulnerable and the way she one-punched most of her enemies as well as squashed the hand of her current enemy left little doubt that she was far stronger than she looked. James remembered the strange findings he had been confronted with in the mountains yesterday. Had she been the one who had moved that boulder? Was that crater her doing as well? It sounded all too plausible. This woman clearly could do all of that, so James was tempted to close this case merely assuming it was her. After all, this woman was a big enough mystery on her own, so he didn\u0026rsquo;t need some small fry like a moved boulder on his mind. How could this woman do the things she did? What else could she do? Who was she? What are her plans? So many questions, and he didn\u0026rsquo;t even know what the hell she said to the last criminal before openly demonstrating her flight powers\u0026hellip;\nSince they couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out anything new from the video, they quickly left the room before the other policemen in the room would start watching from the beginning. It had only been a rumor before, but the fact that there was something like a real-life superheroine out there attracted the attention of the whole department.\n\u0026ldquo;We managed to shoo off the media this time, but it\u0026rsquo;s only a matter of time until this goes public.\u0026rdquo; Jacob didn\u0026rsquo;t seem too happy about it as they walked towards his desk. \u0026ldquo;So, do you think she\u0026rsquo;s connected to the prostitute?\u0026rdquo;\nJames couldn\u0026rsquo;t dismiss the question this time. Both the prostitute and this blonde goddess were definitely remarkable in their own light, but this didn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean they were connected.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; he began. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a bit strange that the one woman dies of something she would\u0026rsquo;ve shrugged off and another only gives a weird wicked smile after being shot.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a temporary thing? Like a drug trip but with super powers instead?\u0026rdquo; Jacob made a good point here.\n\u0026ldquo;This sounds plausible. If I remember correctly one of last drug trips in the diary describes her \u0026lsquo;feeling like she could fly\u0026rsquo; or something.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, it was the last drug trip she wrote about, then she got her cleaning fit and then she died\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Det. Spencer lit a cigarette before he continued. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you were at the very bottom of society and suddenly had superpowers, would you really continue to do what you were doing? No, you\u0026rsquo;d do whatever the hell you want. So, in case there really is a superpower-granting drug out there, things will get ugly. Junkies are violent enough as they are, give them superpowers and you\u0026rsquo;ve got yourself a nightmare.\u0026rdquo;\nIt was now that James became aware of how different their jobs were. While before his cooperation with the police had been of purely investigative matter, he now saw that as a police detective Jacob had a very different view on these outrageous things. Where James was curious to know how these super powers worked in the first place, Jacob was more concerned about what could be done with them. Now that he thought about it, the fact that this woman used her extraordinary abilities to help others made her all the more sympathetic.\n\u0026ldquo;We need to find her,\u0026rdquo; James concluded. The problem was that he had absolutely no idea how.\nAmanda had listened intently to Michelle’s report concerning the hostage situation. She had become really excited at the part, where the last criminal had brought the hostage back into the game, catching Michelle completely off-guard. Her friend had managed to intimidate herself out of this mess, saving the hostage’s life in the process.\n“What was your Plan B?” Amanda finally asked, both amazed that her friend had come up with not one, but two plans in this situation and concerned why Michelle seemed to avoid explaining this Plan B.\n“It’s quite simple actually,” Michelle answered. “Try to guess it first.”\n\u0026ldquo;Easier said than done\u0026rdquo;, Amanda thought, as she tried to think of a way how to clear a hostage situation with the powers she knew of. So far they hadn\u0026rsquo;t discovered anything that could be used to cover the distance and their super speed didn\u0026rsquo;t work the way it did in the comics, making it impossible to catch a bullet after covering this distance. Well, technically she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even need to catch the bullet if she could only establish skin contact before that bullet hit\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Whoa,\u0026rdquo; Amanda\u0026rsquo;s trail of thoughts was disturbed by a strange tingling sensation above her right ankle. First she thought some kind of insect was trying to crawl up her leg, but then she recognized the sensation as the super energy that had coursed through her own body not too long ago. She looked at her leg to spot … nothing. She took a closer look, and felt the spot and there it was: I tiny, almost invisible thread stuck to her leg and connected it - unsurprisingly - to Michelle\u0026rsquo;s own.\n\u0026ldquo;You friggin\u0026rsquo; genius,\u0026rdquo; Amanda exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;You used your costume to establish the necessary skin contact to share your invulnerability with the hostage!\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle nodded affirmatively. \u0026ldquo;Too bad we don\u0026rsquo;t know just how invulnerable we can make others. After all I couldn\u0026rsquo;t give you the same level of strength I have, so it may be possible that a bullet could still be fatal. But I\u0026rsquo;m surprised that you found this tiny thread right away.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s more like I felt the super energy than the thread itself.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really? I didn\u0026rsquo;t even share any of it with you. Funny, yesterday you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even recognize it, when I did. Now the whole power sharing thing seems to work completely different on you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What kind of differences are we talking about?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Before, I could just give you whatever power I wanted, but I had to choose it beforehand. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t possible to just give you the energy for yourself to choose - you just couldn\u0026rsquo;t handle it. Right now, it feels like things are inverted. I can\u0026rsquo;t just give you a certain ability since you somehow deny it. And I have the feeling that if I gave you the raw super energy, you could use it to your own liking.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And probably transform into my super form along the way,\u0026rdquo; Amanda added. She was sure Michelle had considered this possibility as well and refrained from just testing it out because of that. Amanda also considered the possibility to simply deny any kind of energy Michelle wanted to share with her. But right now she doubted she could bring herself to deny anything her friend would offer her and was glad that Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t tempt her. Still, the fact remained that Amanda had much more say in the manner compared to yesterday. Drinking the potion had caused more permanent changes than just her appearance. Amanda remembered Michelle\u0026rsquo;s transformation and compared it to her own. Her own transformation was much more painful\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Say Michelle. Do these transformations differ from time to time?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re happening faster. And more parallel instead of having one wave after another.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And the pain? You didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be in half as much pain as I when I first transformed.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t. The first transformation was the only one that was painful at all\u0026hellip; I kind of regret that I didn\u0026rsquo;t watch your transformation.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why\u0026rsquo;s that? Did you think I couldn\u0026rsquo;t handle a bit more pain?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;To be honest, I\u0026rsquo;m curious to see the transformation happening to someone else, especially since I can see the super energy itself. And since the first transformation seems to be the most important one\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle had a point; her improved senses could have given her a new insight on what this stuff actually did to them. And since she had transformed alone, this insight couldn\u0026rsquo;t be gained anymore. Well, technically all it would take was another person to drink the potion, but Amanda didn\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of causing permanent changes in anyone else as long as they didn\u0026rsquo;t know the complete scale of those changes. Not to mention the fact that whoever took the potion might cause much more harm than she herself had caused. It was a good thing that Michelle and not someone else had found that seed. But what if there was someone else?\n\u0026ldquo;We need to find out as much about this stuff as possible,\u0026rdquo; Amanda exclaimed, rising from her chair. \u0026ldquo;I may have thrown away the chance for you to see my first transformation, but I sure as hell can show you my second one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So you want me to try to give you enough super energy to cause a transformation?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, we\u0026rsquo;ll try that one later. For now I\u0026rsquo;ll just drink the potion while you concentrate on what\u0026rsquo;s happening there.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle silently watched as her friend left the room and wasn\u0026rsquo;t surprised that Amanda returned holding only the two vials of super serum in her hands. It also wasn\u0026rsquo;t much of a surprise that Amanda had used the opportunity to undress completely as her clothes would be as unable to contain her super form as Michelle\u0026rsquo;s pajama\u0026rsquo;s had been when she transformed two nights earlier. What did surprise her was her friend’s sudden decision to transform. Amanda’s determination could only mean that she had a plan. She always liked to plan ahead as she had proved yesterday when she had tried to plan Michelle’s superhero career as well as earlier when she had talked about her plans as to how to deal with Fred.\nThe downside was that Amanda was bad when it came to changing her plans on short notice. There was one time in college where she failed a certain exam because of the professor’s warning to be prepared for everything. Naturally Amanda had tried to learn as many genetic sicknesses as possible while the exam concentrated on one specific sickness that happened to be the one the professor specialized in. While Amanda did know the basic parts about this sickness, the exam required much deeper and – in Amanda’s opinion – useless knowledge, so she failed it. Amanda had called him out on that, but he only retorted that in order to be successful one had to specialize. Even though he had a point, Amanda couldn\u0026rsquo;t accept the fact that he specialized in a sickness that only applied to a very low number of people with an even lower chance of actual healing. Then again, the most blatant example of Amanda struggling with her plans not coming together would be everything that happened since yesterday.\n\u0026ldquo;So, um ready for the show?\u0026rdquo; Amanda\u0026rsquo;s voice was determined, yet still showed hints of insecurity. While it sounded simple and logical that Amanda transformed so that Michelle might actually get some insight about the transformation, it didn\u0026rsquo;t lessen the awkwardness or the embarrassment of standing naked in front of her best friend with the clear intention of being ogled at.\nNodding slightly, Michelle concentrated on her friend. Once again she was mesmerized by the many tiny changes in her \u0026lsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; appearance. Michelle activated her X-Ray vision and tried to get the best possible view on her friend. This was easier said than done, as she didn\u0026rsquo;t know what layer and part of her body to focus on. Sure she knew what to expect during the transformation, she had felt it happen to herself several times, after all. But she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to miss a thing, not when her best friend seemed to transform just for her benefit. Michelle directed more super energy into her eyes and suddenly her perception changed in a dramatic, yet favorable way. Suddenly she could see every part and every cell of her best friends body at once. Normally her X-Ray vision showed her only a certain layer, ignoring everything before and after this. Now it was like watching every layer at once, while at the same time not seeing anything besides Amanda and the vial of super potion she held in her hand.\n\u0026ldquo;My second transformation was my favorite so far, so you better enjoy yours too.\u0026rdquo; Since she could practically see her best friend\u0026rsquo;s nervousness in form of her fiercely beating heart. Michelle couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but try to calm her friend down a bit.\nIt seemed to work as Amanda\u0026rsquo;s heart rate slowed down a bit. Amanda also closed her eyes and took long and deep breaths before slowly bringing the vial to her mouth. This calmed Amanda even further but Michelle, on the other hand, became more and more excited as the potion – glowing with super energy – came closer and closer to Amanda\u0026rsquo;s mouth. From Michelle\u0026rsquo;s perspective everything happened slower and slower, and for a fraction of a second she had wondered why. Then Michelle noticed that she had subconsciously directed more of her super energy into her brain and her whole neural system, just as she had done with her eyes. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t that anything was actually moving slower, but in fact her own perception had increased to the point that everything seemed to move in slow motion.\nFinally the liquid entered Amanda’s mouth and Michelle witnessed the effects it had on her. The first thing to be transformed was Amanda’s tongue. It didn’t change shape, but it was clearly filled with the super energy. Soon her whole mouth followed suit, then her whole head. Michelle noticed that the energy spread faster than the actual transformation. From her own transformations she remembered how she could foresee the next stage of her transformation because of it. First the whole organ would be filled with super energy, then part of the energy was used to transform it into its perfected form. As Michelle watched the changes to Amanda’s brain unfold, she was surprised how simple, yet effective they were. Instead of being somehow redesigned, Amanda’s neural cells simply worked much faster than before. If there had been any structural changes, then these had happened during Amanda’s first transformation.\nSince Michelle already knew the outcome of this transformation, she was aware that the next part of her best friend would change in a much more outstanding manner. Filled with super energy, Amanda\u0026rsquo;s pearl black eyes took an unnatural orange color, but Michelle saw that there were more changes than just the eye color itself. This was to be expected as they shifted into the most perceptive eyes on the planet, rivaled only by Michelle\u0026rsquo;s own that casually ignored the fact that Amanda\u0026rsquo;s eyes were still closed. Next was her hair. Michelle remembered how surprised she was to actually feel the changes coursing through her hair during her own transformation. Now she saw this happening to Amanda and couldn’t find any nerves inside her best friends’ hair as it transitioned from golden blonde to fiery red and lengthened down her back. Since Michelle’s eyes were able to see the otherwise invisible super energy, Amanda\u0026rsquo;s orange eyes and red hair really looked as if they were on fire. This was complimented by the fact that her face had shifted as well, turning from merely beautiful to downright gorgeous. Michelle wondered why she, despite the clear differences between Amanda\u0026rsquo;s normal and super faces, still could see her best friend in this exotic goddess. Well at least Amanda seemed to take Michelle\u0026rsquo;s suggestion seriously as her pleasant smile showed that she was really enjoying what was happening to her.\nAs Amanda\u0026rsquo;s transformation moved from her head downwards her whole torso, Michelle saw, that the actual transformation didn\u0026rsquo;t involve creating new body cells. Instead, there were miniature cells that simply sprang to life as they were filled – no, activated – by the super energy. It became really blatant when this happened to Amanda\u0026rsquo;s breasts that started to expand almost immediately as they were flooded with super energy. They weren\u0026rsquo;t actually transforming, but shifting into a more fitting form. All in all, most of Amanda\u0026rsquo;s organs merely adapted to the increased size of her body and seemed to work more efficiently. This was odd. Except for the super energy that was now coursing through them, there was no hint of the powers Amanda now doubtlessly possessed. Her muscles as well, they grew to a size that would qualify as fit and toned, but otherwise there was nothing indicating the super strength they possessed. What\u0026rsquo;s worse, unlike all other organs, Michelle saw that several of these miniature or inactive muscle cells didn\u0026rsquo;t transform at all even when they were flooded with super energy. It was really strange, her eyes were the only part that clearly showed that the changes weren\u0026rsquo;t only cosmetic in nature. But why?\nStill watching her best friend transform in slow-motion, Michelle noticed that the super energy in Amanda\u0026rsquo;s body seemed to take on a slightly different tone. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t really put her finger on it, but a small part of the super energy just … changed. Wait, she had seen this before. Whenever Michelle used her powers, she somehow changed the super energy into a form fitting for its purpose. And this form, tone, whatever meant that Amanda was about to fly. Sure enough, Michelle could watch her best friend slowly – really slowly from her perspective – rising on her tip-toes. Of course! This was it! The actual powers were the combination of the super energy (in a certain form) and the necessary body part, but they could be shared with others as well. So their own organs didn\u0026rsquo;t actually need to be much different than normal humans as it was the energy that was important. And the muscle cells that were still inactive? Michelle remembered when she had flexed her arms after her first transformation and they suddenly swelled to body builder size. Obviously these cells would remain inactive unless Amanda needed the extra strength. The only part of the potion that affected them at all was the super energy contained within, the actual liquid did absolutely nothing. Not anymore at least, the crucial first transformation was another story. This also meant that Amanda would have transformed into her super form if Michelle had shared her super energy with her, just like they suspected.\nWhile Amanda\u0026rsquo;s naked form slowly rose from the ground, Michelle decided to do the same and became airborne as well. She knew that her now red-headed friend was using this power subconsciously, but she also knew that she could have avoided it. The transformation was over and Amanda finally opened her eyes again. While the two floating women looked into each others' eyes, Michelle decided to bring her own vision and perception back to normal. Still, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but notice that Amanda looked at her with a sense of awe that looked similar to when Michelle had transformed yesterday. Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t things be the other way around now? After all it had been Amanda that had turned from what seemed to be a normal woman into a goddess of power right now and not Michelle. Then it dawned her: as Amanda had closed her eyes the whole time, this was the first time she could see Michelle\u0026rsquo;s improved form and the super energy she possessed.\n\u0026ldquo;Wow, this was something else,\u0026rdquo; Amanda eventually exclaimed. \u0026ldquo;I feel even more powerful than during my initial transformation.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That was to be expected. I think the first transformation itself uses up quite a bit of energy while this almost used nothing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So this isn\u0026rsquo;t some kind of trend where every transformation leaves you more powerful than the last?\u0026rdquo; Amanda eyed Michelle once more.\n\u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem this way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Then why do you have much more of this super energy than I have?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Michelle had totally forgotten about that. \u0026ldquo;Well, I drank a double dose earlier.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Three guesses where this excess energy is stored,\u0026rdquo; Amanda said as she nonchalantly stared at Michelle\u0026rsquo;s breasts. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t believe yours are actually a tiny bit bigger than mine\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So this was your true concern?\u0026rdquo; Michelle teasingly complained. But she had to admit that Amanda demonstrated a supernatural perception here. Not only were their breasts of near-identical size and shape, Michelle had failed to notice the distribution of super energy inside her own body until now. It really seemed as if her body would house a certain level of energy and everything above this point would be stored in her breasts.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s because those are the only fat cells we have on our bodies,\u0026rdquo; Amanda suggested, ignoring Michelle\u0026rsquo;s comment. \u0026ldquo;So, did you learn anything interesting through watching my transformation?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle began to explain her discoveries to Amanda as the latter started to create a costume of her own. It was basically a blue version of Michelle\u0026rsquo;s black leotard and ballerinas. Michelle was surprised that Amanda didn\u0026rsquo;t even comment on their \u0026lsquo;costumes\u0026rsquo; simplicity but seemed more concerned on the matter at hand. She also created a pocket specifically to contain her last vial of super potion.\n\u0026ldquo;Hm, so the main difference between normal humans and us is that we can now store and use this super energy?\u0026rdquo; concluded Amanda after Michelle had finished her little report. \u0026ldquo;Well it\u0026rsquo;s not a big surprise, but it\u0026rsquo;s good to know. Unfortunately that also means we have no clue about what other powers we might possess. So we can only try out as many possibilities as possible.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Didn\u0026rsquo;t we already try that? I clearly remember making a fool out of myself for an hour with zero success.\u0026rdquo; Michelle recalled their trip to the mountains yesterday.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s still worth a try. Now we know more about the powers and at the very least we can train the ones we already know about. And since we\u0026rsquo;re both super we can even help each other with that.\u0026rdquo;\nWith this Amanda flew out of the still open window, in a similar blink-and-you\u0026rsquo;ll-miss-it fashion she had used with Fred before. A second later she hovered over the city and looked to see whether Michelle was following her.\n\u0026ldquo;Ahem,\u0026rdquo; came a voice from right behind her. Amanda turned around to see that Michelle obviously had no trouble keeping up with the empowered redhead. This gave her an idea.\n\u0026ldquo;Catch me if you can,\u0026rdquo; said Amanda as she darted away from her blonde friend. She aimed at the mountain range outside the city - not only was it better to train their powers in an uninhabited area, a few obstacles would also spice things up a bit. For a split-second Amanda wondered if it was even possible for them to train their flight powers, as the control had come pretty instinctively. But as she saw Michelle closing up to her, it became clear that practice did indeed help a bit. Soon enough Amanda felt her friends arm catch her leg above her ankle. Great, now Amanda was \u0026lsquo;it\u0026rsquo;.\nIt took Amanda a while to catch Michelle in return. Even though neither of them was flying at top speed, Amanda was sure this was due to Michelle having more experience flying. After all Michelle had found out about their invulnerability by crash landing into a mountain and creating a crater while she herself had not even a scratch. It was only natural that Michelle allowed herself to fly a bit faster than her friend. Still, in order to catch Michelle, Amanda had to fly faster than even that, and eventually she succeeded. The idea of two women in their mid-twenties playing a game of tag may sound silly, and even with super powers added to the mix, Amanda wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have thought of this as an interesting past-time. But that had been before she learned how great it felt to fly, to try out more complicated maneuvers while they tried to catch each other.\nThe game went on for over an hour before they decided to do something else.\n\u0026ldquo;So tell me, how did you do this strange 3D-model-vision-thing you told me about?\u0026rdquo; asked Amanda as they had landed near an abandoned mine. They had chosen this place because of the many rocks and boulders lying around.\nMichelle was a bit surprised by that. She had expected Amanda to just try it out, as she hadn\u0026rsquo;t needed any hints from Michelle so far.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a bit hard to explain. I channeled more and more super energy to my eyes and somehow it happened.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, may I try it on you then?\u0026rdquo; Amanda asked.\nNow Michelle understood why her friend seemed so reserved about this. After all Amanda would practically see everything of her. This was also the reason why Michelle hadn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned how she couldn\u0026rsquo;t decide on which layer of Amanda\u0026rsquo;s body to focus on. It had been weird enough to mention it once.\nMichelle nodded and watched as her friend started to channel more super energy into her eyes. Something was strange about it, though. The energy was still in its original form, so Amanda didn\u0026rsquo;t use her X-Ray vision. This reminded Michelle more of her earlier attempts to get a clearer view on the whole city from above which wounded up to nothing. Michelle was about to mention that Amanda should activate her X-Ray vision first, when she saw that the energy in Amanda\u0026rsquo;s eyes changed. But not in the way it would change for X-Ray vision. This was something new, something that even Michelle hadn\u0026rsquo;t done so far. Getting excited, she super-charged her neural system again, and watched Amanda\u0026rsquo;s new discovery in slow motion.\nTwo beams of light came out of Amanda\u0026rsquo;s eyes. Just like her eyes, these beams were orange in color, and came closer towards Michelle at an incredible speed. Even though she didn\u0026rsquo;t really know how much faster her perception was at this point, the blonde woman had no doubt that they moved faster than a human eye could perceive. Michelle remembered how yesterday during her training run, Amanda had asked if she had heat vision. After several attempts, they had concluded that this was not part of the powers she possessed. Why was Amanda using a power, she herself had specifically tried and failed to use before? And what\u0026rsquo;s more, why wasn\u0026rsquo;t she the least bit scared that it was aimed at her? Was she really that confident in her own invulnerability, that not even another superpower could hurt her?\nShe got her answers as the beams hit her straight in her chest.\nThe first thing she realized was that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t any pain. Instead it felt good. Really good. Michelle was reminded of the burning house yesterday. The heat back then had felt nice and comforting. And now these rays were even hotter, but they also felt better. Unlike her clothes yesterday, her costume wasn\u0026rsquo;t impressed by Amanda\u0026rsquo;s heat vision, either. Still, it relayed the feelings of pleasure towards the breasts it covered. Having her clothes burn off her body had felt good. Being shot in her chest had felt disturbingly great. And now she was receiving a combination of both while her whole neural system was super-charged, making her breasts more sensitive than before. Caught off-guard by the intense pleasure in her chest, Michelle came almost instantly.\nMichelle dropped an one knee in utter pleasure. As her perception returned to normal, Amanda had already stopped her heat vision and was running towards her.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my god, are you alright? \u0026hellip; Please say something\u0026hellip; I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean to hurt you!\u0026rdquo; Amanda downright panicked.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m fine,\u0026rdquo; Michelle half-moaned, trying to hide the pleasure she felt right now.\n\u0026ldquo;You sure? Damn, leave it to me to screw up. First Fred and now you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I told you I\u0026rsquo;m fine.\u0026rdquo;\nNow Amanda seemed to get that Michelle wasn\u0026rsquo;t moaning out of pain. Her face turned as red as her hair while she looked away in shame.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok\u0026hellip; that\u0026rsquo;s a bit too awkward.\u0026rdquo;\nThankfully it only took a few more seconds for Michelle to regain her composure.\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t think heat vision meant this kind of heat,\u0026rdquo; she joked, trying to make it less embarrassing.\nAmanda didn\u0026rsquo;t answer but instead looked at a nearby boulder. Once again two orange beams came out of her eyes, but this time Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t see them in slow motion as they cut through the boulder in question like a hot knife through butter.\n\u0026ldquo;Nope, seems like the problem lies with you,\u0026rdquo; Amanda exclaimed, causing both women to start laughing. At least the awkwardness was gone now.\nOnce they calmed down, Amanda continued. \u0026ldquo;Could it be that you\u0026rsquo;ve got more super energy now than before I hit you?\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle gasped. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re right.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How did this happen?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe I absorbed your heat vision and turned it into super energy. Come to think of it, this would also explain why I had more energy after the fire rescue yesterday.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So you mean we can absorb heat and turn it into super energy?\u0026rdquo; Amanda asked excitedly.\n\u0026ldquo;Sounds like a convenient way to replenish our power.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Speaking of which, do you want the power shot me with back or do you plan on drinking your second dose?\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda didn\u0026rsquo;t answer with words. She took out the vial, opened it and drank its content.\n\u0026ldquo;Still tasty, but otherwise underwhelming,\u0026rdquo; she commented as her body absorbed the energy inside the super potion. Unsurprisingly she didn\u0026rsquo;t transform in any way, but stared at Michelle.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Michelle asked, realizing too late that Amanda was X-Raying her, no she was already using this 3D-Model-Vision, she had originally intended.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re … impressive,\u0026rdquo; was all that Amanda said before letting her vision return to normal.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry, I just needed to know if I can do it too. Now you, try to use heat vision.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle did as she was told. She was sure that she had tried something extremely similar yesterday, but failed to do so nonetheless. Maybe she just wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to use heat vision at all? Still, watching Amanda do it had made it really easy to grasp the concept behind it. This gave her confidence. Her blue eyes focused on the same boulder Amanda had used as target practice as she concentrated the energy in her eyes and\u0026hellip; it worked. She could feel her vision turn into heat, and the exact spot she was looking at being disintegrated immediately.\n\u0026ldquo;Cool!\u0026rdquo; said Amanda after Michelle was done.\n\u0026ldquo;I think the proper term is hot,\u0026rdquo; Michelle corrected her.\n\u0026ldquo;Both fit for blue heat vision.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Point taken.\u0026rdquo; Seems like the heat vision always has the same color as their eyes.\nThey spent a few minutes trying out their new super power. Since all they had to do to properly aim their heat vision was look at the intended target, this part was almost ridiculously easy. The challenge lay more in the intensity of the ray, as a too strong blast would not only cut through one rock, but also whatever was behind it. When they were sure that they could control their heat vision well enough to only lightly scorch the rock they used as target practice, both women agreed that there was little use in further training.\n“When you look at it, this ability isn’t that useful,” Amanda began. “Best I can think of is this heating-the-gun-till-it’s-too-hot-to-hold-routine. It wouldn’t even be helpful against another person with superpowers.”\nMichelle hadn’t actually considered this possibility. “Do you really think there are others with these powers?”\n“Well you found the seed of your precious plant on the sidewalk, right? Chances are that there are more seeds somewhere. So it can’t hurt to prepare for the worst case scenario.”\n\u0026ldquo;People getting super powers and immediately deciding to go on a rampage because of it? I think that\u0026rsquo;s a bit too pessimistic,\u0026rdquo; Michelle sighed. \u0026ldquo;But then again it is the worst case scenario.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My thoughts exactly. That\u0026rsquo;s why I think it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to master these powers as quickly as possible. So that you have the necessary experience to deal with any aspiring super villain.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That I have the necessary experience? What about you? Didn\u0026rsquo;t we plan on becoming superheroines together?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I did say that, yes. But what I meant was that you would become the heroine and I the sidekick that eventually emerges. This didn\u0026rsquo;t change just because I drank the potion earlier than anticipated.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle was dumbfounded by this revelation. Earlier she had dismissed Amanda\u0026rsquo;s belittling herself as caused by her guilt about her encounter with Fred, now she heard that Amanda had planned this even before that. But why? For years it had been Amanda who had been the more confident one, with Michelle more or less hiding behind her friend. Still, Michelle had always considered themselves to be on the same level.\n\u0026ldquo;Why does this sound like you are putting yourself below me?\u0026rdquo; Michelle sounded more offended that she intended to.\nAmanda sighed. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not how I mean it. I just don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s good for two \u0026lsquo;super chicks\u0026rsquo; to appear at the same time. People would just get us confused with each other. So it\u0026rsquo;s better for me to wait you\u0026rsquo;re famous enough as a superheroine.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t even intend to become famous!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you really think you can keep a low profile? How many people have seen you use super powers yet? You of all people should know how the media are going to react once word of a real life superheroine reaches them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You have been seen as well, Fred even got a clearer view on you than anybody who saw me! You could just as well be the heroine and I the sidekick!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not when you consider what you\u0026rsquo;ve done so far compared to me. You went around saving people while my only action comes across as bullying at best. Even if Fred doesn\u0026rsquo;t go around badmouthing me, you already have the better reputation to become the hero.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As I said, I\u0026rsquo;m not in it for the reputation or to be called a hero. I just want to help people and that\u0026rsquo;s all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My point exactly.\u0026rdquo; Amanda sported a big smile as she said that. \u0026ldquo;You are aware that you sounded like the big blue boy-scout himself just now?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The who?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I take that as a no. That just settles that you\u0026rsquo;re the optimal choice for being the hero.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle wanted to retort something, but instead, she let her head drop. Amanda had seemingly given it more than just a fleeting thought, so Michelle wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to win this argument.\n\u0026ldquo;Do I really have to go public?\u0026rdquo; she asked. \u0026ldquo;You know I\u0026rsquo;m not good when it comes to being in the spotlight.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not asking you to go public right now. Actually it would be stupid to do so. Eventually people will start asking about the new superheroine in town, and that will be your cue. And don\u0026rsquo;t be concerned about your shyness. You literally stood naked in front of a crowd of clothed people and pulled it off really well.\u0026rdquo;\nMichelle\u0026rsquo;s face turned red as she remembered the incident with the burning house. She had been utterly terrified when she found out she was naked but once her strange costume powers had taken care of that, all had worked out. It had felt great to be cheered on by these people. She could get used to that. Damn, she even had used this as an argument in her strange dream last night.\n\u0026ldquo;You win,\u0026rdquo; Michelle exclaimed faintly. \u0026ldquo;But as the sidekick you have to be my moral support.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tch, please,\u0026rdquo; Amanda snorted. \u0026ldquo;This isn\u0026rsquo;t the job of the sidekick. It\u0026rsquo;s the job of the best friend!\u0026rdquo;\nAmanda walked over to a bunch of rocks that were lying on the floor. She picked one up - it was only a bit bigger than a basketball - and held it in one hand. Michelle spotted that her best friend seemed to struggle a bit with her balance. While she was definitely strong enough to lift it, her body wasn\u0026rsquo;t heavy enough for her hold the boulder as she pleased. After a few seconds of testing, Amanda threw the rock in Michelle\u0026rsquo;s direction. But what was supposed to be a basketball pass with a rock in place of a ball looked unintended funny as Amanda hadn\u0026rsquo;t accounted for the recoil her own throw would cause. The rock missed Michelle by several feet while Amanda fell backwards and had to use her flight powers in order not to fall over. This gave Michelle an idea.\nPicking the \u0026lsquo;ball\u0026rsquo; back up, Michelle also took her time to get accustomed to its weight. Then she used her own flight powers to steady herself while throwing the rock to Amanda. Her friend had paid attention, though and was able to catch the rock almost perfectly. The process repeated several times, with the rock being thrown faster and faster, then replaced with a bigger rock. After about half an hour, the two superwomen decided to stop this little game. Not because playing ball with rocks that could easily kill everybody due to size and speed of the projectiles wasn\u0026rsquo;t fun, but the super energy they consumed was pretty high. Interestingly, they used up more energy for their flight powers than for the super strength.\nAs their energy began to fade, they decided it would be better to return home instead of risking an early transformation back to normal right in the middle of nowhere. Arriving at her apartment, Michelle wanted to use the opportunity to refill the vials she had given Amanda yesterday, but her best friend was adamant that one dose would be all she needed for now. While she would have preferred to have Amanda transform as many times as herself, Michelle accepted her best friends’ decision. She wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had any chance in an argument either, as Michelle didn\u0026rsquo;t even know for sure why she wanted Amanda to transform more often - or at all for that matter. Still, Michelle knew that when it came to it, Amanda would support her in any possible way. Once her redheaded friend had left to return to her own apartment, Michelle began to think of all the troublesome things the future might hold for them. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t really describe it, but for some reason - maybe it was the trust and support from her best friend - instead of being terrified, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t wait for tomorrow.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part06/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 06"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"“I can’t believe you actually took it!”\nMichelle’s first reaction to seeing her best friend Amanda with the body of a goddess hovering through her apartment window was different than either of them had expected it to be.\nOne of the reasons she reacted this way was that Amanda had not only declined the mysterious super power granting potion just yesterday, saying she wanted to see the long-term effects of taking the potion. Another reason was that she had secretly wanted to see Amanda’s first transformation first-hand. The red-headed goddess standing in front of Michelle was the result of this transformation. Michelle herself was in her normal form right now as she didn’t intend to transform before nightfall.\n“I can’t believe I’m already regretting drinking it,” Amanda answered sadly. “I just ruined my ex-boyfriend’s life.”\nAmanda started to tell her friend about the events that led up to her transformation. She had been feeling sick for the whole day and to top it off, Fred had come to get his stuff out of her apartment. After that, Amanda had drunk the strange liquid to transform from the bleached blonde waitress she had been to the red-headed amazon she was now. Amanda went into great detail about how she encountered Fred again and how she just wanted to mess with him a little. When Fred wasn’t as awestruck and friendly as Amanda had expected, she had begun to trash his car – just to teach him a lesson of course. Fred hat been really pissed about the car so Amanda tried to fly around carrying him and accidentally let him fall…\n“…and the landing ruined his left knee. I checked it with my X-Ray vision, and trust me, he’ll have to recover from this for a really long time – IF he recovers at all that is,” Amanda concluded while tears were running down her cheeks.\nMichelle didn’t know what to say about that. It was only natural for Amanda to feel guilty as her powers had caused more harm than she had intended. Still, Michelle was eager to know what exactly Amanda had intended.\n“Why did you confront Fred after your transformation? What kind of lesson did you want to teach him?”\nAmanda didn’t answer right away. Slowly she brushed away her tears as she formulated her answer.\n“It just kinda happened. I hovered over the city wondering how to test out these powers, and then I spotted him. So I decided to show him this killer body and see how he reacts. I figured that with this look…” Amanda pointed at herself “…he would either try to hit on me or be too intimidated to even try.”\n“But that’s not what happened.”\n“At first he did seem to be intimidated, but that didn’t last long. When I teased him, he only became annoyed as if I were just another girl.”\n“Of course he did. He couldn’t know that it was you, right?”\n“Yeah, I know… encountering the ex-boyfriend right after acquiring super powers could only end in disaster. Drinking the potion itself was a mistake. If I only had stuck to my original plan to wait\u0026hellip;”\n“If I hadn’t insisted on giving you some of the potion, you wouldn’t have been tempted. I knew about your breakup, but I didn’t consider it when I gave you those vials. So this is my fault as well.”\n“Don’t try to take the blame from me. I shouldn’t have drunk the potion but that’s what I did. And instead of helping other people like you, I ended up crippling someone close to me. This stuff has brought out the worst of me!”\n“No!” Michelle said this more eagerly than she intended to. “You may have hurt him with your powers, but you’re feeling bad about it while still being super. That just shows that this stuff doesn’t cloud your judgment. You were emotionally vulnerable due to your breakup. Damn! You even slapped him before your transformation. So don’t make it sound like it was the potion that made you do it!”\nSurprise was written all over Amanda’s face about Michelle’s sudden outburst. But it didn’t take long for her to find the reason behind it. If the potion really had an effect on her personality, it would mean that Michelle would not only have been affected as well, but actually more so than Amanda who just took it once.\n“I didn’t mean it that way. It’s just that when I saw you saving that child yesterday, I didn’t see the woman that had just spent an hour in the woods trying and failing to get to know her own superpowers, but a real-life superheroine. Someone, that actually deserves the powers she possesses. This whole mess just shows that I am not worthy of these powers.”\n“…yet,” Michelle added. “Right now you carry some emotional baggage, but when this whole Fred thing is sorted out, I’m sure you will live up to your expectations. To be honest, right now I am more operating on luck than anything else. I downright panicked in that burning house and last night, I almost got somebody killed because of my recklessness.”\n“What happened?”\n“Well I prevented a rape and one of the thugs shot me right in my breast which felt so good that I gave him an opportunity to shoot the woman I tried to save from them. Luckily he shot me a second time instead. So you see I am just as inexperienced with this as you are, and I have a lot to learn if I want to become a superheroine.”\n“I see, even you have your problems with these powers. But right now, I’m still super, so I’ll have to make it worth it.”\n“What do you mean with this?”\n“You said it yourself: I have to get over this whole situation with Fred. So the best course of action would be to fly over and apologize to him before my transformation runs out.”\nAmanda started to float off the couch and towards the open window of Michelle’s apartment. Right before the window she came to a stop. Amanda faced to the window, so Michelle only saw her from behind. From this perspective Amanda seemed much more secure than she had during their conversation. The fact that her bare feet hovered a few inches above the floor helped as well. Even for Michelle, who had flown under her own powers several times during the last 48 hours, the sight of her best friend hovering majestically in the air was as impressive as it was unbelievable.\n“Could it be that you have something on your heart as well?”\nMichelle hesitated a bit before giving her answer. Memories of her strange dream last night as well as her encounter with James flashed through her head.\n“It can wait. I’ll just come over later.”\n“Ok, I’ll keep a window open for you.”\nWith this she left through the window before ascending so fast that Michelle had trouble keeping track of her. While it was a rather sudden exit, it also guaranteed that nobody besides Michelle had actually seen the red-headed goddess leaving her apartment.\n“I’m really sorry to have called you here on a Sunday afternoon Mr. Thompson, but this case really falls into your jurisdiction,” said Dr. Peter Philips.\nThe forensic doctor barely hid his own excitement as he led James to his lab.\n“Detective Spencer mentioned that you were already familiar with this case.”\n“He mentioned a drug addict dying from an overdose that wouldn’t be lethal considering her history. So he suspected her to be another woman posing as her. I don’t really see where I fit into this.”\n“Indeed, we suspected that there were two different women involved; one drug addict and another similar looking woman with no drug history that died trying to pose as her. That’s why we ran a DNA test with hair we found in her apartment.”\n“And? Do they match?”\n“Here is where it gets tricky. The standard tests have been 100% positive claiming that their DNA is indeed identical. But a simple look through the microscope showed that they were anything but.”\nThey entered the lab. A woman’s corpse was lying there. Obviously it was the woman in question.\n“The original hair we found in the apartment contained DNA with 46 chromosomes, the standard for a human. But this mysterious beauty here has a DNA with 100 chromosomes, including the 46 that are identical to the ones found on the old hair.”\nJames took a closer look at this woman. She was indeed pretty. While she wasn’t the most beautiful girl in town, there was something about her that seemed familiar to James. He just didn’t know what that was.\n“100 chromosomes you say? That would mean this person isn’t even a human being.”\n“Well 46% of her are still human, as for the rest, I have no idea.”\n“What the hell changes her DNA so much?”\n“I’ve got no idea, but it sure worked wonders for her looks. The pictures we found of her showed her more fitting the image of a crack whore. This woman could easily pass as the nice girl next door.”\n“It may have been good for her looks, but not for her health.”\n“I’m not too sure about that. I think whatever happened to her brought her to peak health; which includes a reset of her drug-history. If her body’s addiction was cured as well, her death would be the result of her own stupidity.”\n“There’s only one way to find out. Prepare to transport her to our facility; my colleagues and I will take care of her case from here.”\nJames gritted his teeth as he said that. This would mean his superiors would learn about this case, and most likely they would keep him out of the loop.\nThe warm afternoon sun had turned the hospital room into a makeshift sauna. While it brought some fresh air into his room, Fred soon regretted asking the nurse to open the windows wide enough for him. This was definitely the worst weekend of his entire life. First his girlfriend found out about his affair, causing two breakups at the price of one which pretty much ended all the dreams and hopes he had. Then just when he had gotten his stuff from his now-ex-girlfriend Amanda, this strange redhead had appeared out of nowhere with the sole goal of making his life miserable.\nHer flaming orange eyes should have been his first hint that this woman was trouble, but Fred didn\u0026rsquo;t realize this until after she had trashed his car with nothing but her bare feet – without any regret whatsoever. When he had seen her hovering over the ground, he had attempted to flee, resulting in her picking him up and dropping him from at least ten feet in the air. Fred wondered whether this redhead had actually intended to let him fall. She had looked rather horrified as his leg had given away under him, and sure enough he had been hospitalized because of this.\nFred lost his consciousness shortly after this, and he was surprised when he woke up in the hospital. But his misery wasn’t complete until the doctor told him that he would be bedridden for quite some time and that his knee would most likely never recover. Right now he was more concerned about being bedridden, as he still had things to do. And time was now running out on him.\n“Oh no, not you again!” Fred blurted out, when he saw the weightless redhead entering his room through the window. She was still dressed in a blue leotard and nothing more. The woman’s beauty was just as supernatural as her strength or her ability to fly.\n“What a warming welcome,” said the redhead as she gracefully landed on the floor. “But I guess I kind of deserve it.”\nShe didn’t look as confident as she had back when they first met. To Fred, it seemed like she indeed regretted what had happened.\n“What do you want here?” Fred asked coldly.\nThe redhead stopped in her tracks, seemingly intimidated by his cold welcome.\n“I… came to see how your leg is doing,” she said avoiding his gaze.\n“It is fine, I’ll be running around as if nothing happened in a day or two,” he said sarcastically before adding, “Now leave me alone!”\nThe woman took a look at his knee. “You’re lying.”\n“No, I really want you to leave!”\n“I’m talking about your leg. Will it recover?”\n“That’s none of your business.”\n“Of course it is,” she said, now looking at him again. “I’m the reason you’re…”\n“…crippled. Damn straight you are,” Fred interrupted, meeting her flaming eyes with a cold stare. He watched as the gorgeous redheads eyes filled with tears. She didn’t start to cry, though, and Fred was glad about that. Making her cry wouldn’t help his situation at all.\n“Oh I’m so sorry; I really didn’t mean to hurt you.”\n“Right, you only had my best intentions in mind when you came over to – how did you put it? – mess with me! How about you stop messing around and finally get out of here?”\n“You’re really cruel. I am here to apologize and all you do is shoving me away.”\nThere was a hint of annoyance in her voice, and Fred actually welcomed it. Watching such a beautiful face with this pitiful expression made it hard for him to be angry at her.\n“What did you expect? You ruined my life in a matter of minutes and now you expect me to forgive you? How naïve can you get?”\n“Ruined your life? Aren’t you exaggerating a little too much? I’ve got X-Ray vision, so I see that your knee will take time to recover. But even if it never fully recovers, you’ll be able to walk on your own. So please do me a favor and don’t act as if you were paralyzed.”\nFor some reason, the tears in her eyes had disappeared – giving her a much more confident expression. Something about her seemed familiar, but Fred couldn’t put his finger on it.\n“Ok, I admit it. You alone didn’t ruin my life; you were just the final nail in the coffin.”\nThe redhead seemed to be satisfied with this and Fred was happy that she didn’t ask for a further explanation. She then moved closer to him and put her hand on his wounded knee. For a second the pain in his leg seemed to disappear, but when she let go of his knee it returned with full force.\n“What the hell did you do there?”\n“I tested whether or not my powers include healing other people,” she answered disappointedly. “But unfortunately this doesn’t seem to be the case. I shared my invulnerability with you just now, but it also stalled the healing process. It seems like I can’t use my powers to make you feel more comfortable.”\n“Healing others? Yeah this would have solved most of my problems,” Fred admitted. He was actually beginning to feel comfortable around her. “Speaking of your powers… what exactly are you?”\n“A young superhot superwoman,” she answered, sticking out her tongue.\n“I see that. And you don’t even know what you can do.”\n“That was kinda obvious wasn’t it?” she sounded a bit embarrassed. “But I’m learning fast.”\n“Would you at least tell me your name?”\n“I told you before, it’s a secret.”\n“Yes, but I have to call you somehow don’t I?”\n“Then think about a name. I could always use some inspiration for a good superhero name.”\nA superhero name? Fred recalled a conversation with Amanda where she had asked him to think about a superhero name for her. Back then it was rather silly, but this woman here did possess super powers which she still showcased by hovering a few feet above the floor. Come to think of it…\n“How about Devil?”\n“What?” The redhead glared at him with a strange mix of fury, confusion and embarrassment. “Why this name? I mean… do I really look that… um, evil to you?” While she said that, she slowly rose higher and higher until she bump hit the ceiling.\nFred chuckled for the first time since he encountered this woman. He had intended to tease her, but her reaction was more intense than Amanda’s had been.\n“I probably should explain that. I used this nickname for someone else before, and you reminded me of her.”\nShe remained silent for a short while. Her head still hovered directly below the ceiling.\n“So I take it you didn’t exactly like ‘her’, either,” she concluded as she started to descend.\n“On the contrary, I actually love her,” Fred was surprised at his own honesty.\nbump The redhead had hit the ceiling faster this time, and small cracks in the ceiling were visible. If she kept this up, the next bump might be her going through the roof.\n“First you want to get me to leave, now you compare me to the woman you love.” She started to shake some debris out of her red mane. Any other woman would have been more concerned about a concussion right now. “You’re not making any sense.”\nShe had a point. Why did he even mention Amanda here? To a complete stranger?\n“She broke up with me and hates my guts\u0026hellip; as I said; you were just the final nail in the coffin.”\n“Why exactly did she break up with you?” ‘Devil’ asked cautiously, as she descended once again.\n“Let’s just say it was my own fault,” Fred sighed.\n“So you did something she couldn’t forgive?” she dug further.\n“Obviously. I don’t want to talk about it.”\nShe curled her lips into a disapproving frown; obviously she would have like to know more about his breakup. But Fred had no intention of telling her things, that he hadn’t even told Amanda.\n“Speaking of forgiveness,” she said. “Is there anything I can do to make up for your trouble?”\nWas she still going on about that?\n“It’s pretty clear that you didn’t intend to hurt me. So there isn’t really anything I could ask of you.”\n“How about compensation for your car?”\n“That would be nice, but I doubt you have the insurance to cover it.” Fred thought about it for a moment before adding. “Actually, if you do have some money to spare you might as well buy the car itself.”\n“What?” she was surprised but at least she didn’t bump into the ceiling this time. “You love this car… I mean you already got angry at me for simply standing on its roof.”\n“Because I already intended to sell it,” he explained. “Anyway, you don’t need to buy it if you don’t want to.”\n“I’ll think about it,” she said, before starting to turn around. “I should leave now.” She floated towards the window before turning to him one last time. “It may be a while before we meet again.”\nFred simply nodded, then added “See you.”\n“Bye.” And in the blink of an eye, she was gone.\nAmanda soared through the air, gaining altitude at an incredibly fast rate. She came to a stop high above the city to sort out her thoughts. Pretending to be a totally different woman was much harder than she had expected. It was made even worse by the fact that she was both guilty for hospitalizing him in the first place and pissed off at him for cheating on her. She actually thought that she had done a good job, but Fred already saw some similarities between the two hers. He had actually given her the same nickname he had given her before. At least he hadn’t told ‘Devil’ that this nickname had originally been restricted to their bedroom. But what really bugged her was that he had nonchalantly said that he still loved her. Why had he said that? Why had it felt so good to hear that, that she had lost the control of her flight powers?\nAnd he intended to sell his car? Even before their breakup, she had been pissed more than once because she thought he’d like his car more than her. What the hell had gotten into him?\nAllowing herself into a free fall, Amanda began her trip back to her apartment. It took only two minutes for her to arrive there, but she enjoyed them. The freedom of flying made her forget the conflicting feelings she had.\nBack in her apartment, she stayed hovering in midair and waited for her powers to fade. A short moment of weakness had turned her world upside down. By drinking the potion she had gained a taste of power, power that could easily be used to hurt and destroy – as she had proven with Fred and his car. But also power that could help other people.\nThe only thing that disappointed her about her powers was the fact that while she could share her powers to make others invulnerable and thus painless, she wasn’t able to heal other people. Trying out to heal the wound she had caused remembered Amanda of her failed attempt to become a doctor. While she wasn’t stupid, Amanda just wasn’t able to focus on learning long enough to stand a chance in college. She may have picked up a thing or two, but in the end she had to drop out and was stuck as a waitress ever since. Being able to heal others, well that would have been too good a superpower to be true. Right now she would have traded all of her other powers for that. Maybe this was her guilt speaking, maybe it was the fact that her powers were already running out at this very moment.\nThe first outward sign of her transformation was her self-made leotard dissolving into thin air, exposing her super body to the world one last time. Next, she couldn’t use her flight powers anymore and landed on the floor. She then shrunk down back to 5’3” while her muscles lost their definition and her breasts shrank down to their original size. When she had seen Michelle transform back to normal yesterday, she had been almost as thrilled as she had been watching her best friend becoming super. But now she was … underwhelmed. While her earlier transformation had started painful and ended being really pleasurable, this transformation just felt normal. Sure, she was now powerless but it didn’t feel as bad as she had expected. Then again she had spent her entire life without super powers, so it was only natural that a few hours wouldn’t make her feel otherwise.\nAmanda then remembered that she had been able to spot differences in Michelle’s appearance after her first transformation, so she went to her mirror to see how she had changed.\n“Holy crap!”\nAmanda had indeed slimmed down a little and she was also sure that her face had become prettier – if only a little. The real difference was her hair. Where before she had sported bleached blonde hair, Amanda now had golden blonde hair similar to Michelle’s hair in her super form. But Amanda’s original hair color was brown – just like Michelle’s was. For some reason, Amanda’s natural hair color had changed. She was still wondering why this had happened as she heard her phone ring.\nThe day had been quite eventful for Michelle until now, given her encounter with James and Amanda’s dropping by earlier. The brunette had tried to get some rest by lounging on the couch and watching TV, but soon grew bored of it and preferred to do something more useful. To Michelle it seemed like her body didn’t really need much rest – just like she only needed two hours of sleep last night. So far any effect of the potion had been benevolent. Then there was the strange dream she had last night. This alter ego that had appeared to her seemed to have a deeper meaning, but that made it all the more mysterious. Michelle had kept this dream a secret from Amanda, but she soon had to tell her friend about it. The best way of telling whether this was caused by the potion was by seeing whether or not something similar would happen to Amanda. Well, she had agreed to meet her later, so it would be for the best to tell her then.\nRight now Michelle was sitting in front of the mysterious plant that had turned her life upside down. Having brought it to her living room, Michelle took a good look at it. There were ten buds in total; five of them were full with the super potion, while the other five were in various stages of refilling. So far she had transformed thrice until now, while Amanda had taken another three doses with her – at leastone of which she had already used. This meant the bud that had contained the potion for her very first transformation was full again. Michelle didn’t really know how much potion she had drunk that first time –most likely the whole contents of a bud – so she was pretty sure that it would take about two days for a bud to refill.\nMichelle only possessed three vials that she could fill with the potion – and she had given them to Amanda. This wasn’t really a problem, though. While it was true that a vial could be carried around easily to transform when necessary, it could just as easily get lost or stolen. If anybody saw her stripping down, then drinking the potion and transforming into her super self, this person would sure as hell try to get their hand onto the potion as well. Or worse, film her and put it online. Trying to transform while on the job would be even more dangerous, considering she worked at a TV station. For the time being Michelle thought it would be the best idea to transform only in the confinements of her own apartment – and maybe Amanda’s. This way she really wouldn’t let her superhero life interfere with her normal life.\nCarefully the young woman started to milk the five buds into a bottle. Together, it was about half a liter – making each filled bud contain roughly 100ml. It was funny how a supposedly alien plant seemed to adhere to the metric system, but it made things easier to her. Michelle also milked the buds that weren’t completely full yet in order to find out how long the plant would need to regenerate. In total she had about 800ml – or eight doses – of the potion. Two days for complete regeneration still seemed like a good guess. This meant she could use up to five doses a day. As long as there weren’t any complications with drinking too much of the potion, this meant she could be super permanently. While it was indeed a tempting thought, Michelle scrapped the idea almost immediately. She may not have been totally happy about her life recently, but there were still several things she cherished. The young brunette preferred to think of her time as a super powered goddess as an addition to her life, not a replacement.\nNow that she was done milking the plant, Michelle carefully put it back on her nightstand. When she went to put the bottle with the super potion into her fridge, she thought about Amanda and her first transformation. Michelle was a bit disappointed that she hadn’t seen the spectacle first hand, but that wasn’t only because she wanted to see her best friend transforming. She also wanted to see how exactly this first transformation took place and how it differed from the following ones – by watching the whole ordeal with the improved eyes of her own super form. Well, this opportunity was lost, but if she really insisted on seeing a first transformation, she just needed to give somebody else a dose of the potion – somehow her curiosity about the first transformation dropped at this thought.\nTaking another look at the bottle with the super potion, she started to wonder whether there existed an upper limit of how much of the potion could be drunk. If she drank a double dose, would she transform into an even bigger, bustier and stronger superwoman or would she just have twice the amount of super energy at her disposal? Probably the latter, but there was only one way to find out. Michelle had intended to wait until evening to transform, but it seemed pretty pointless now. She had already exposed her powers before, and now Amanda had been flying around in broad daylight as well. Michelle quickly filled a glass with a double dose of the strange green liquid before stuffing the bottle into the fridge. Then she returned to her bedroom to undress herself. Standing once again in front of her mirror to see her ‘normal’ body, she downed the green potion.\nAfter having transformed three times already, Michelle had grown accustomed to the sensations of her transformation. By the time she finished drinking, her mind had already been supercharged, and Michelle knew that her face was now stunningly beautiful with blue eyes instead of her near-sighted brown ones, while her hair was now a long golden mane. Then her whole body joined in the transformation, and she quickly transmuted from the skinny 5’3” woman to the athletic 6’3” goddess whose naked form became weightless as her transformation was completed. Michelle smiled at this fact; somehow the urge to fly was a part of her transformation, and she had only suppressedit once so far. Michelle’s theory seemed to be correct. She could feel that she now possessed at least twice as much super energy as she did during her last two transformations. It wasn’t that she was now stronger or faster, but Michelle had twice the energy supply at her disposal now.\nShe conjured her costume, a black leotard and matching black ballerinas and checked her look in her mirror. She could actually try to add new things to her costume, but decided against it. The only thing that was really missing would be a symbol that could be associated with her. This on the other hand required a superhero name - which Michelle lacked as well.\n“A superhero name,” Michelle thought aloud. She wanted to become a superhero to help people, and she didn’t really need a name for her super self. Still, she had to admit that she would need some name to identify herself with. And if she didn’t choose one, the media would. Too bad her powers didn’t come with an animal motif. Names like Plantgirl or Potionwoman were a no-go as well, since they only revealed the source of her powers. And other names like Power Princess or Superwoman only sounded silly and arrogant to her, especially when she imagined introducing herself as such. It might work if other people called her this, though. This way it would be more of a title than a self-chosen name. For now, Michelle decided to wait and see what the media would call her. She didn’t really want to draw any unnecessary attention, though. Her super powers still had a surprise effect, and she intended to use it as long as she could.\nMichelle left the confinements of her apartment and took to the sky. Hovering high above the skyline, the blonde goddess reveled in the feeling of superiority that came from being above the city. Like the night before, Michelle watched the streets from high above, waiting for a situation that required her help.\nAfter ten minutes of searching, it became clear to her. There wouldn’t be a crisis that required a superhero to step in just because she wanted to. Being a superhero would require patience; this much, Michelle could already tell. She began flying circles around town while she kept looking for someone who might need her help. Half an hour later, Michelle heard the sound of sirens and found herself happy for it\u0026hellip; At least for a second before she realized that the sirens definitely meant something bad was happening, and that she shouldn’t be glad even though she had spent the whole time waiting for it.\nLooking for the source of the sound, Michelle discovered a police car in pursuit of another car. Using her X-Ray vision, Michelle spotted four people inside the fleeing car – three men and a woman. One man was driving, one on the front seat, while the last man and the woman sat in the back seats. All three men wore black leather jackets and matching black cold weather masks. With her dress it was clear that the woman didn’t belong to these two. Michelle wasn’t really surprised to see that the man next to the woman pointed a gun at her. This confirmed that she was indeed the hostage in this situation.\nCompared to the attempted raping yesterday, these were professionals. Michelle had to consider her options carefully. Her primary concern was to get the hostage to safety. Attacking them while they were still driving would only endanger the hostage and the traffic around them as well. This meant she would have to wait until the men left the car. She still had the element of surprise on her side, so she followed the car – flying directly above it. There was no reason for them to look up, as they were more concerned about the police behind them. As for the police, they were too focused on the getaway car to spot the blonde superwoman.\nMinutes passed while the cars blazed through the streets. While the police car struggled to pursue the fleeing car, this proved absolutely no problem for the airborne woman above them. Eventually the criminals succeeded in losing the police car as they drove a red light just before the upcoming traffic made it impossible for the police to follow. Michelle wondered why there wasn’t at least a second car as reinforcements. Then again a part of her was happy, that this – from her perspective – boring chase was over and she could step (or better fly) into action soon. She couldn’t help but feel excited.\nA few minutes later, the car drove into a parking block. Michelle had to use her X-Ray vision not to lose them while she herself stayed out of their sight. She could feel her heart begin to beat faster as the car stopped and the critical moment for Michelle would arrive. She watched as the men said something to the woman before leaving the car without her. Michelle couldn’t believe her luck. Now that they considered themselves safe, the three men abandoned the now useless hostage.\nThe men walked away from their original car towards another car that – so Michelle thought – was most likely their next escape vessel. The blonde superwoman didn’t intend to let them reach this car. Having watched everything with her X-Ray vision, she easily flew into their direction from their blind spot. Thanks to her flying ability, her approach was totally silent. The closer she got to them, the faster and more forceful her heart beat. If it wasn’t for her excitement, she would have wondered if it was audible from the outside. It wasn’t. Unnoticed, she attacked the first criminal, the one who walked behind his partners.\nThe man had no chance to realize what was happening to him. Suddenly Michelle’s leg appeared in front of him and before he could react, he had already tripped over it. In the split second before falling over, he could feel something – Michelle’s hands – pushing him towards the ground. The force of the impact instantly knocked him out. With a single glimpse of her X-Ray vision the blonde superwoman verified that the man only sported minor injuries before turning to his comrades.\nMichelle had to admit that the two remaining men reacted faster and more organized than she had expected them to. Both of them had already pointed their guns at her and fired several times. The two men were understandably surprised to see their bullets bounce off her body without doing any damage at all – neither to her nor to her clothes. Michelle reveled in the pleasant sensation that coursed through her body as two of the six bullets hit her breasts. Unlike last time, she was prepared for these sensations, and she didn’t give any outward sign of being affected at all by the normally fatal projectiles. Throwing his gun away, the bigger one decided to punch her. Michelle didn’t even bother to dodge. She knew that he wouldn’t be able to hurt her, even if his fist hit her right on her nose.\nThere was just one thing she hadn’t accounted for: their weight difference. With her 6’3”, Michelle was rather tall for a woman, but her enemy stood a little taller than her and was rather bulky. So when he hit her with full force the impact caused her to fall backwards. The man cursed, holding his hand that had clearly paid the price for trying to break an indestructible nose. Her pride on the other hand was a little dented. Michelle used the time to get back on her feet. She wouldn’t make the mistake of getting caught off-guard again. When the thug tried to hit her once again with his other hand, she grabbed it and squeezed it until she heard the bones inside break. The man screamed in agony, but a punch into the stomach ended this fight and his consciousness.\n“Stop it right there!”\nMichelle heard the last thug shout from behind her. As she turned around she saw that he was standing next to their original car, holding the hostage at gunpoint. He must have run there while Michelle was distracted with his partner.\nMichelle watched them in utter horror. Any feeling of superiority that had built up during the situation was now gone. She had been careless. Once again this carelessness risked the life of the person she had intended to protect. Why hadn’t she played it safe and dealt with the hostage before beating up the bad guys? It was no use trying to think about her mistakes now. She had to calmly analyze the situation and find a way to save the hostage. Since super speed wasn’t exactly her strong suit, catching the bullet was no option. The man should be nervous as well. After all, he had just seen bullets bouncing of her chest and his comrades getting knocked out quite easily. Michelle forced herself to look as confident as possible. She still had some aces in the hole, so while she tried to find the right one, she needed to distract his from her actual fear. Slowly, she took a step forward.\n“One more step and I’ll blow her brains out!”\n“And then what?” Michelle crossed her arms, trying to look as imposing as possible. “What do you think will happen after you killed your hostage? Right now she’s your lifeline. If she dies, so will you – this much I can guarantee!”\nMichelle’s gained confidence as plans formed in her head. This guy had no idea what she was capable of, no idea that the costume she was wearing was actually part of her body and looked the way it did because she wanted it to, no idea that she could share her powers through skin contact, no idea that she could fly, see through walls and he had no idea how strong she actually was.\n“Y-you’re bluffing,” stammered the man. “You want to save her, don’t you?”\nIf plan B worked, the woman was already safe, but Michelle didn’t dare to find out without trying plan A.\n“Of course, but here’s the problem: If you kill her, that means I failed and I’ll really be pissed at you. And in case you didn’t get it, there’s nothing capable of stopping me from picking you up and flying with you to the Sahara desert where I’d abandon you.”\n“F-Fly?”\n“Oh yeah, you didn’t see this one yet,” Michelle said as she became airborne and subsequently much more intimidating. Both the man and his hostage gasped in surprise. Michelle took her chance and slowly floated closer to them, just slow enough so that the man didn’t realize it.\n“So you actually have only two choices. You either drop your gun, let her go and get arrested by the police which will lead to a fair trial, or you pull the trigger and fall under my jurisdiction, which means so much torture that you will wish for death. It’s your choice.”\nEven with the mask it was clear that the man was utterly terrified of Michelle’s display of power. After a short while he dropped the gun and let go of the woman.\n“You win.”\nMichelle didn’t waste any time and knocked him out as soon as the woman was away from him. Only when he lay on the floor unconscious, Michelle allowed herself to sigh in relief.\n“Phew he actually fell for my bluff,” she exclaimed.\n“I’m really grateful for you rescuing me, but what part of it was a bluff?” asked the now free woman. Now that she looked at her, Michelle was sure she had seen this woman before, but she couldn’t put her finger on it.\n“I doubt I could have tortured and killed him. While I’m physically capable of doing that, I don’t want to harm – not to mention kill - anybody unless it\u0026rsquo;s necessary. And maybe not even then.”\n“So the only thing that saved me was that he didn’t know that? I doubt that this tactic will work forever.”\n“Actually I had a plan B, but let’s just be happy that it didn’t come to it.”\nThe sound of sirens filled the air, signaling that the police had finally figured out their whereabouts. The woman looked outside to beckon the police cars towards them.\n“By the way, what’s your name?” she asked as she turned around, only to find that she was alone.\nHigh above the parking block, Michelle wasn’t too proud of herself, as she had almost screwed up again. What’s more she had no idea whether her plan B would have worked to begin with. Her X-Ray vision was quite helpful when it came to silently watching how the police made its way to the crime scene – by ignoring the layers of concrete and steel as well as the wires and security cameras between her and the scene.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part05/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 05"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"“That was so awesome,” was the first thing Amanda said when they arrived back at Michelle’s place. “How you jumped out of this burning house, with this girl in your arms, descending to the ground like an angel.\nI wish I had brought my camera, you should’ve seen yourself there. No wonder they applauded you; you’re a natural superhero.”\n“You’re giving me way too much credit.” Michelle almost blushed. “I was more concerned about me being naked than to check for the child’s health.”\n“I’d bet ten bucks that you made her invulnerable anyway, so your lack of clothing WAS the bigger issue. Speaking of which, what the hell is this stuff?”\nAmanda pointed at the leotard that had appeared on Michelle’s body. The fabric seemed to be a strange combination of spandex and latex. It hugged her curves like a second skin which – given the fact that it had grown out of her body – it actually was.\n“I don’t really know, I thought about not wanting to be naked and about the plans for a costume we had so far and somehow it appeared.”\n“So you mean it looks like how you want it to? Could you try to make it look different? Like blue perhaps?”\n“Alright, I’ll try.”\nMichelle already knew why exactly Amanda wanted her to try blue. She had suggested red \u0026amp; blue costumes based on Superman earlier, so Michelle already expected that Amanda would demand the diamond shaped S symbol next, if this worked. The super powered blonde decided to do her friend this favor and imagined her wearing a blue leotard with the super logo on it. While the costume normally consisted of more than just a leotard, Michelle’s habit of levitating whenever possible made the illusion of Supergirl – or a grown-up Superwoman – complete.\n“Oh my god.” Amanda gasped as she saw Michelle’s costume changing in color. “DC just called, they want their character back.”\n“Hope you like it, because this is the only time I’m going to wear this kind of costume.”\n“This is cool, how does it feel?”\n“Just like before I changed it.”\n“Not that, I mean in general. Is it comfortable or maybe even straining since it is part of your powers?”\n“Actually, I still feel as if I’m wearing nothing.”\n“You mean it’s an illusion?” Amanda grabbed a part of the costume that now stretched away from Michelle’s torso. “No, it feels quite real to me.”\n“This is strange. It feels as if you were touching my skin. I could even share powers with you.”\n“Wait, does that mean this costume is part of your body? Can you try to take it off?”\n“Um… sure.”\nMichelle began to take of the costume. She felt a little awkward even though Amanda had seen her naked during her transformation\u0026hellip; maybe because Amanda had asked her to undress instead of pleading her to put some clothes on.\nOnce Michelle had taken it off, she let it fall, only to have it dissolve in the air before reaching the floor.\n“So it seems like this costume can only exist with you.” Amanda concluded while nonchalantly staring at her friend\u0026rsquo;s exposed breasts.\nThis didn’t escape Michelle’s attention as she created a self-made tank top and panties to lessen her friend\u0026rsquo;s ogling.\n“Seems like creating a costume uses up a lot of super energy,” Michelle thought aloud. “This is rather strange.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I try to get a feeling about how much super energy I have left. I was a little surprised at how little energy the rescue in the burning house had cost me, when I compared my supply before and after. So I was positive that creating a costume should use up just a little amount of super energy.”\n“So it takes more energy than you thought it would. What’s the big deal? It’s not like you have to create a new costume every five minutes.”\n“That’s not it. Creating this tank top used up much more energy than the whole child rescue did. Obviously the bigger leotard should have used up even more, but didn’t.”\n“Maybe you didn’t pay enough attention. You were stressed, weren’t you?”\n“Yes but I clearly remember how much energy I had before that. It’s as if somewhere along the line, my energy supply had been refilled.”\n“Or you just thought it took more energy when in reality it was just as easy as you expected it to be.”\n“You mean, I misjudged the consumption just now?”\n“You could try it again, just to be sure. We can’t really recreate the burning house situation after all.”\n“Could it be that you just want to see me naked?”\n“Wha…?” Amanda’s face turned red and she turned away. “You didn’t mind before…”\n“But you did. Anyway, if I’m right this may be the last of my super energy; if you’re right, it’ll take a little longer for me to turn back.”\nMichelle undressed once again, and her clothes dissolved once she wasn\u0026rsquo;t touching them anymore. Then she recreated the black leotard that she had worn before. Unfortunately, her supply of super energy ran out before she was finished which forced the fabric to dissolve immediately as Michelle felt her transformation start to undo itself. First, gravity reclaimed its reign over her, and her bare feet touched the ground for the first time since she left the site of the burning building. As soon as she landed on solid ground, her body shrank back down to its prior state. Her athletic look disappeared as her muscles shrank in size, giving her a slim appearance instead. Her breasts shrank down to their original A cups, a size more appropriate for her body. As her vision got blurry, Michelle knew that her eyes had changed to normal, and she didn’t even bother to look as she knew her golden blonde hair had shortened and darkened to its original brown as well.\n“And here I am plain old Michelle again,” she commented.\nAmanda looked at her dumbfounded. Even though Michelle’s transformation back to her mortal self was far less inspiring than the transformation to her super self, the sight of a woman’s body changing so fast in front of her eyes was still mesmerizing.\n“Well that settles it, creating a costume uses up quite a bit of the super energy,” said Michelle.\nShe then left for her bedroom and returned a few minutes later, dressed in her pajamas.\n“Actually, I don’t think I really understand what this super energy is. You say that it’s used for each of your superpowers but it’s hard to believe this. I just don’t see how the same energy can grant you super strength and flight at the same time.”\n“Ok, it’s a bit more complicated than that. From what I felt, it’s like the super energy is the raw form, and when I use a power a part of it gets changed into the kind of energy that is needed for this power.”\n“I see, so it’s not directly used for your powers but converted into something that is.”\n“Yes, the normal human body doesn’t seem to be capable of handling the raw energy. When I shared my powers with you, I had to convert the energy beforehand so you could only use it for the very purpose I decided.”\n“Hm, if you can convert this energy so easily and are even able to send it to another human body, maybe you can also convert a different energy into super energy.”\n“What kind of energy do you mean?”\n“You know like the energy you consume through food, it’s measured in calories for a reason.”\n“Maybe, but now that I’m normal we won’t find out.” Michelle yawned.\n“It seems like we should call it a night.”\n“Yeah. Oh wait, I wanted to give you something.”\nMichelle took out the backpack they had with them before and took out the three vials with super serum. She offered them to Amanda.\n“I know you don’t want to drink it yet, but just in case anything happens, I want you to have them.”\nAmanda was awe-struck when she took the vials. She was holding the greatest treasure she could think of. Still, her plan to wait until the time was right was unchanged. After she thoroughly thanked Michelle for the vials, she left to return home.\nMichelle went straight to bed and fell asleep almost immediately.\nIn her dreams she relived the events after she accidentally drank the potion that started it all. She recounted in detail the pain she had felt right before she transformed from a plain brunette woman to a stunning goddess with powers beyond her imagination. The dream continued from her transformation to her first flight in a new world. The experiments, learning about her invulnerability by crashing into a mountain, lifting a boulder that no human could possibly lift, her first tries to run with superhuman speed, her flight back, her masturbating in her super body and finally her transformation back to a brunette mortal – albeit an enhanced one.\nShe heard her own voice commenting, “Those were good times.”\nNext, her dream showed her the second transformation. This time she had wanted to impress Amanda with her new body and showed off her transformation. Her second transformation felt several leagues better than her first, but she kept her calm, and even when her flight powers tried to lift her off the ground, she subdued them.\n“Why didn’t you follow your instincts to become airborne?” Again, her own voice asked this.\nMichelle remembered her conversation with Amanda, from Amanda’s refusal of drinking the potion to her planning a superhero career for Michelle. The whole afternoon they waited before going out under the cover of night.\n“She declined such a wonderful gift, so why does she decide your actions?”\nThe young woman wondered if the voice was really hers, but she felt herself whispering, “because she is right. I always wanted to make the world a better place. I just had no idea how.”\nShe remembered the powerless feeling as she had to watch her colleagues add oil to the fire when they broadcasted doomsday scenarios about the meteor crash. With the powers she now possessed in her super form, she could easily prevent this fear by stepping in front of the camera and promising to protect the city at all costs.\nMichelle suddenly stood in a blank space. Everything around her was white, and she couldn’t make out whether she was in a white room or just in a bright open space. The young woman realized that she had the appearance she had before her very first transformation. Her plain form and her lifeless hair that had disappeared after her transformation were now reminding her of how even her normal looks had improved thanks to the potion.\nMichelle wasn’t alone in this white dream space. In front of her floated a stunningly beautiful woman with golden hair and blue eyes. This was the woman Michelle had become after drinking the potion, her super alter ego so to speak. Both versions of Michelle were naked; a fact that bothered the mortal Michelle to no end, even though she knew this was a dream.\nAfter a short silence, her super alter ego spoke.\n“I see, you want to improve humankind. But there are complications, aren’t there?”\nA vision of the rapist she had encountered earlier appeared before her eyes. Michelle had picked that man up and thrown him away like a bag of garbage. The man crashed onto the ground, breaking his arm and maybe shoulder in the process.\nThe vision disappeared and the goddess before her continued.\n“I can clearly understand why you rejected his advances. Scum like him doesn’t have what it takes to mate with us. But if you want to help humankind, how exactly did you help him here? Wouldn’t it have been better for humankind if you got rid of this foul individual?”\nMichelle was terrified by this suggestion. “Killing him isn’t the solution, but after this experience, maybe he changes his behavior.”\n“You don’t know for sure?”\n“I don\u0026rsquo;t. But in the future, I’ll go patrolling around town and if he didn’t change his ways, I will bring him to the police.”\n“Why didn’t you do so in the first place?”\n“I wanted to know about my powers first and preferred to keep a low profile.”\n“But now our power has been exposed to others. We saved this child out of the fire.”\n“And it felt good!”\nThe other Michelle smiled as she answered, “Indeed it did!”\nMichelle opened her eyes in her still completely dark room. She was surprised to be fully awake right away. In fact, she felt as if she had slept for days. The strange dream she had was still vivid in her memory. It was clear that this dream had a deeper meaning, but she couldn’t tell what it was. The other version of her had been so intimidating at first but she turned out to be curious after all. Was she the symbol of the potion tampering with her mind? A split-personality in the making? Or was she just an aspect of her personality that had always been there? The young woman had no means of finding out, so she could only continue like before.\nWondering why it was still dark in her room, Michelle looked at her alarm clock to see it was 2 am. She had barely slept for more than two hours! Since she felt so alive that she wouldn’t be able to sleep for a long time, Michelle considered this to be yet another improvement for her normal body. This was good for her plans to become a superhero, as she would spend the day working and living a normal live while using the whole night to patrol the city.\nMichelle got up from her bed and took a long shower. Despite her downright godlike appearance in her super form, she still cherished the changes that were done to her mortal self. A few small improvements had sufficed to make her significantly more attractive, and Michelle gladly accepted the confidence boost that came with that.\nOnce she was done, Michelle wondered what to do next. A growl from her stomach reminded her that breakfast was the best way to start a day, even though it was 2:30 am. She realized that she had much more appetite than normally, a fact that had escaped her attention yesterday. Michelle didn’t really mind, she was sure this was a good thing, and subsequently ate twice as much as she was accustomed to. Once she was done eating, Michelle was reminded of Amanda’s words about converting other energies to super energy. Michelle wasn’t too sure about that. She frowned at how little she really knew about this strange energy and how it enabled her to do all these insane feats. It was strange; whenever she found out about a new power of hers, she could already use it quite well. Michelle felt as if the knowledge of these powers had been engraved into her mind. No, there was a proper term for it: instinct. She instinctively knew how to use each power – at least once she became aware of it. This meant her attempts to discover new powers were doomed to fail from the very beginning. During her training a few hours ago, she had just tried to manipulate the super energy to do ‘something else’ which didn’t work at all. The real way would be to actually know what she wanted to do – or at least think about it.\n3 am in the morning wasn’t exactly the best time for Michelle to be up already, as it was really boring. Granted, she didn’t really have plans for the day to begin with. The only thing she wanted to do was to transform and fly out on patrol – after sunset that is. While it was still dark outside, Michelle was anxious to transform only a few hours after her last transformation had ended. She remembered how Amanda had compared her to a junkie before Michelle had proven that the potion did indeed transform her into a super powered goddess.\nIt was indeed a possibility that she could become addicted to the potion. This was why she intended to wait until evening to transform, but it wasn’t even morning yet. Michelle had to admit that she wasn’t as excited about becoming super as she had been before her second transformation. Normally, an addiction would make her crave for another dose of the potion, right? She thought about the implications.\nThe possibility of addiction or another side effect for not waiting long enough; those were two arguments against taking the potion now. It was Saturday night she had good chances of finding someone to help. If there was a minimum time limit between taking the potion, she would eventually have to test it out. After all, in the future there might be a situation where she has to drink the potion short after her last transformation, or maybe even while she was still transformed. Two arguments on each side so in the end, she went with her gut. She was bored and liked to be super, so she took a glass and milked the mysterious plant in her room for a dose of the magic liquid.\nMichelle looked at the glass of green liquid and thought about her first two transformations. The first transformation had started really painful, but felt better and better with each part of her that shifted into perfection. The second transformation had been leagues better than the first one, with the changes to her neural system being pleasurable and all the changes on her body occurring practically at the same moment, intensifying the pleasure each change brought. Michelle was certain that these differences were caused by the fact that her body had been changed to better handle this green liquid. Standing naked in front of her full length mirror, Michelle drank it down.\nIt was very similar to her second transformation. She felt the changes beginning in her mouth the moment the liquid had entered it and felt them continue to her brain while the actual liquid was on its way to her stomach. Michelle was just finished drinking when she already felt her mind awaken and her vision becoming sharper and better than humanly possible. It was clear that the transformation happened faster than even the second time, but Michelle was still able to feel every change happening on its own. In her mirror image she could see how the super energy swept over her hair, elongating it and changing its color to golden blonde. She could also feel the rest of her body changing, her face becoming prettier, her arms, legs and torso becoming longer while the muscles on them grew into slight definition while her breasts practically exploded in size. Michelle felt each of these changes happen and with them, she felt more pleasure than normal humans could ever dream to experience. She rose into the air – naturally, as she didn’t prevent it this time. After not even ten seconds her transformation was complete.\nEven after transforming twice before, Michelle couldn’t help but smile from ear to ear as she saw her mirror image hovering above the floor so casually, as if it was the most normal thing to do. Michelle wondered why her transformation had happened even faster this time, but shrugged it off as it meaning that she had grown accustomed to transforming.\nAfter admiring herself in the mirror for a while, Michelle created herself the black leotard she had used before. She really needed to think out her costume later that day. Michelle also created some shoes. She was pretty sure that she couldn’t create a thick sole for boots, not to mention that creating too much fabric would eventually become a waste of her super energy. When it came to her, she would be just fine continuing to fly around barefoot, but since it would look pretty weird in the long run, she settled for some ballerinas. With her provisory costume completed, Michelle flew out into the night.\nSoon it became apparent that Michelle would need much patience for her superhero career. Sure, there were several people outside going home from whatever club they came from. Most of them would take a cab or at least go home together. After half an hour of patrolling the skies, Michelle found a young woman going home alone and entering a side road where Michelle spotted some thugs. When the woman noticed them, she was already surrounded.\n“Look who came to visit us,” one of the men said – probably their leader. “A nice woman looking for some entertainment.”\nThe other men laughed. There were five of them including the leader.\nThe woman obviously knew in how much trouble she was, as she was taking a can of pepper spray out of her bag.\nOne of the men standing behind her took out a gun, pointed it at her and released the safety loudly before threatening her.\n“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”\n“And here I wanted to say something very similar to you!” Michelle said as she landed in between him and the woman and grabbed the gun in his hand.\nThe gun went off and the bullet hit Michelle straight into her right breast. Michelle had been totally sure that she was bulletproof, and she was right in that assumption. She had also checked out the thugs with her X-ray vision and knew that this was the only gun they possessed. Therefore it had been the right choice to shield the woman with her own body. What she had not taken into account was that her breast was still an erogenous zone and that the impact of a bullet would send an erotic pleasure through her body. For a second, she was lost in this unexpected sensation and the man used it to fire another shot at her – this time aimed at her forehead. He didn’t see or realize that the first bullet had only aroused her, but he got a clear view of the second bullet being flattened on her forehead and falling down without causing any damage to her. The man was too shocked at this sight to react to Michelle’s kick that sent him flying into the next wall, knocking him out.\nMichelle turned around to see that the woman had held her own against the remaining four men. They obviously didn’t want to get hit by the pepper spray. And now that they saw how their comrade was knocked out by this strange newcomer, the thugs suddenly had a change of heart as they turned around to run away. Five seconds later, Michelle had knocked out every one of them. She had told her alter ego in her dream that she would turn over this scum to the police, and she planned to stick to that.\n“Call 911, tell them we got some wannabe rapists here,” she ordered the dumbfounded woman.\nThe woman did as she was told, and the moment she turned back to Michelle, she found that the superwoman had already left into the air. From above Michelle watched the police take the woman\u0026rsquo;s statement. Of course, the police didn’t believe the woman’s story about a mysterious superheroine beating them up and then suddenly disappearing, but that shouldn’t be too much of a problem as long as they took in the thugs.\nWhile she was watching them, Michelle absentmindedly massaged her right breast. The sheer pleasure of the bullet hitting her had almost made her screw up. Only sheer luck had made the guy try to hit her instead of the woman she had intended to save. Michelle decided that she had to learn how to deal with these situations. Maybe self-defense classes could give her the knowledge for that.\nMichelle patrolled the city until dawn, but she found nobody who needed her help. With all the couples she saw on the streets she felt more like voyeur than a super heroine. She returned back home feeling happy that she could help at least one person. Still, Michelle couldn’t deny that she herself felt envious about those couples for having found someone to go home with. Then again Michelle would have much less trouble finding the right man for her than she had two days ago. Soon Michelle’s thoughts travelled to what she would do with Mr. Right once she had found him, and she started to masturbate above her bed like she had done during her first transformation.\n“Hello?”\n“Mr. Thompson? This is Detective Jacob Spencer, remember me?”\n“Of course I do. How’s it going?”\n“Sorry to call you on a Sunday morning, but I didn’t want to wait until you heard these rumors elsewhere.”\n“What rumors?”\n“About some kind of angel or superwoman or something like that. There have been some cases where people swear to have seen a blonde stunningly beautiful woman who can not only fly but is super strong as well.”\nJames almost missed a red light after hearing this.\n“You’re kidding, right?”\n“No, James. There’s a giant of a man who claims to have been beaten up by that woman for trying to rape her and trust me, he looks as if he was hit by a bus. There was also another attempted raping that was prevented by her if the witness is to be believed. She also seems to have saved some child from a fire and was seen by a whole group of onlookers as she flew away.”\n“This sounds really strange.”\n“You bet! Too bad I only heard rumors and have nothing that you might be interested in, but if you want to interrogate the witnesses, I could arrange that.”\n“Just send me a copy of their statements and I’ll be fine.”\nJames wondered if this had something to do with what he had found in the mountains. In that case he actually had a good trail which he would follow immediately.\n“How about you? Working on an interesting case right now?”\n“More or less,” Detective Spencer answered. “It’s about a Junkie prostitute who died of an overdose.”\n“Doesn’t really sound interesting,”\n“Yeah, but when you look at her corpse, you start to doubt that she was a junkie at all. She is way too good and healthy looking to have the drug history she’s claimed to have.”\n“A woman that looks too good and healthy? I didn’t know something like this existed.”\n“Even her friends claimed that she suddenly looked far better than before and looking at her older pictures, they’re right. That woman was a mess. What’s more, the dose that killed her seems to actually have been child’s play to her and could’ve been only lethal for someone who had never taken that stuff.”\n“Well, she either got one hell of a makeover or she was replaced by a similar looking woman. I’m betting on the latter.”\n“They’re checking her DNA to what we found in her apartment as we speak and her autopsy is running too. Actually, we found a great amount of a woman’s hair in her trash. I’m betting that the real junkie has just shaved her hair and is running around with a wig now.”\n“Then all you have to do is find her and the case is closed.”\n“Not exactly. This woman didn’t actually commit a crime, so there’s no reason to search for her. It’s more about finding out who the dead woman really is. Well, this is as interesting as it gets.”\nThey continued their chat for a little longer before James had finally reached his destination. He still couldn’t believe that the owner of the pajamas he had found in the mountains had been in the database. According to her file, Michelle Jenkins had been part of the TV news team that had promoted the meteor evacuation database and was more or less forced by her colleagues to turn in a DNA sample. This gained her some sympathy from James, who knew all too well how it felt to be left doing the wet work for his colleagues. As most people in that particular database were just hypochondriacs, Michelle Jenkins seemed to be one of the few exceptions. Her picture on the other hand wasn’t that impressive. James wasn’t the guy to be superficial, but the picture he had seen showed a rather plain brunette where the rumor he had just heard of described a blonde bombshell. Maybe he was just following a dead lead. Still, he went up to her apartment and rang the bell.\nHearing the doorbell, Michelle had to chuckle about the irony. Yesterday, if Amanda had come a little later, Michelle would have already transformed into her super self. Now, she had just transformed back to normal half an hour ago. She looked through the spyhole first – oh boy, if this handsome guy had disturbed her during her little private time, he would have been in for the surprise of a lifetime. Luckily she was a bit more composed now, as she opened the door.\nJames was surprised by Michelle’s looks. He was sure this was the woman he had seen on the picture in the database, the same brown hair, the same facial structures and he was sure it was even the same glasses she wore. But he had to admit, that the picture didn’t do her justice. For some reason this woman was far more attractive – no, beautiful – than he had expected.\n“Yes?” Michelle broke the silence.\n“Um … Miss Michelle Jenkins?”\n“That’s me, yes.”\n“My name is James Thompson. I’m working as a scientific consultant for the police right now and I’d like to ask you a few questions.”\nMichelle was surprised that this guy was supposed to be a scientist, but she was more alarmed by the fact that a scientist was standing in front of her door.\n“What kind of questions are you talking about?”\n“It’s about some mysterious thing that happened in the mountains in the night of Friday to Saturday. It may be just a big prank, but it somehow points to you.”\n“Ok, come in.”\nAs she led him to her living room, Michelle considered her options. If this guy had traced her from her original trip to the mountains, he sure as hell had the brains he claimed to have. Sending him away would only make her look suspicious, especially since she didn’t know what exactly had led him to her.\n“So, what kind of prank are you talking about?”\n“A boulder big enough that it can only be moved with special equipment has been moved, with no traces of such equipment left behind. It actually looks like it was carried by a person.”\n“And what exactly leads you to me? I highly doubt I could carry that boulder you speak of.”\nMichelle was bluffing, of course. She was pretty sure that this was the boulder she had tested her super strength on.\n“Well, near the boulder I found this,” James said as he took out a plastic bag with pink rags inside. “Does this look familiar?”\nMichelle forced herself to nod as casual as she could.\n“I used to have a pajama like this, but I threw it away a week ago,” she lied.\n“I see, that explains why your DNA was found in these clothes. Do you have any idea who could have taken these out of your garbage to leave a false trail to you?”\nJames was getting desperate. His only lead had been a prank on its own, and he had little to no reason to continue this conversation. Still, he somehow didn’t want to do that. This woman was strangely fascinating to him, he barely could think straight in her presence. He had actually planned to somehow lure her into revealing that she did know something about the things in the mountains, but he had screwed it up by being too honest with her.\n“No, I don’t know of any particular person that would do that. But I have a question to you as well.”\n“And what would that be?”\n“Do you address all your questions' to women\u0026rsquo;s feet?” Michelle teased.\nJames' face turned red the instant she said that.\n“No, I’m… um there were footprints in the mountains and I was trying to see whether they could be yours?”\n“So you still think it was me?” she half-joked.\n“No.” James tried to sound as serious as he could now. “Your feet are too delicate – I mean small.” James swallowed hard, clearly showing his nervousness.\nWhat the hell was wrong with him? He was acting like a teen boy who was alone with a girl for the first time. James didn’t believe in love at first sight, but this woman came dangerously close to making him reconsider. Too bad it didn’t help him in his current case.\nMichelle on the other hand enjoyed the effect she had on him to the fullest. It was the first time in her life that a man was so intimidated by her – and she wasn’t even in her super form right now.\n“Well, I should get going.” James prepared to leave. “Thank you for your time.”\n“It was my pleasure,” Michelle answered flirtingly while at the same time being a little sad that this hot stud was running away.\nJames was already halfway on his way to the door, when he stopped and turned around.\n“Oh one more thing: Would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow?”\nFred hadn’t expected a warm welcome when he arrived at his ex-girlfriend’s apartment. He had cheated on her, she had found out, and in the end he had lost both women. All that was left was the confrontation with his now-ex-girlfriend which would result in him giving back his spare key to her apartment and carrying his own stuff out of it. All accompanied by them arguing, meaning that she would yell at him while he remained silent. He was in the wrong here, and he didn’t see any reason to sugarcoat it.\nWhen Amanda opened the door, Fred expected her to start throwing a tantrum. Instead she just glared at him and kept her calm. Fred saw that his ex-girlfriend didn’t look too good right now. She either had not slept enough or was getting sick, maybe both.\n“Are you here to get your stuff? Took you long enough!” she said, without bothering to greet him.\nFred knew her well enough to know that she could act strong for a long time. Still the rings under her eyes showed that most of it was an act. He held out his spare key.\n“And to return this one, actually.”\nAmanda took it and opened the door further to reveal a box full of his stuff.\n“The box itself is a little farewell gift,” Amanda said sarcastically.\nOnce Fred had taken his belongings, Amanda asked him.\n“Do you have any last thing to say to me?”\nFred shook his head.\n“Is that so? Well I actually have one last thing to say to you.”\nShe came closer to him as she said that, before slapping him straight across the face with all the strength she could muster.\nFred stumbled but didn’t fall. He had been surprised by the force of her slap, considering how under the weather she looked. His cheek burned and a red hand-shaped mark would appear right where she had slapped him. Otherwise he was fine.\n“You don’t look well. Please get some rest and take care of yourself.” His words of goodbye sounded more mockingly than he intended to. He may have broken her heart, but he wasn’t enough of an asshole not to care for her health. Unfortunately…\n“After everything you’ve done I don’t care for your sympathy. Now get lost!”\n…Amanda didn’t take it that way. With this, he left.\nAnd now she was alone. As soon as Amanda had closed the door, tears started to fill her vision and she barely fought them back. She had only found out yesterday that Fred had cheated on her, but now their relationship was completely over.\nShe felt terrible right now. The events of the day before had taken a toll on her health in form of a cold. First she found out about Fred, but then Michelle had told her about a discovery she had made. Amanda remembered how her friend talked like a drug addict about her first trip, not believing that her friend really had transformed into a super powered amazon. But when Michelle had demonstrated the effects, Amanda witnessed her friend turning into a full-fledged goddess. She had never seen a woman of such beauty in her life, couldn’t believe that this was still her best friend and couldn’t believe that such a woman had offered to share this gift with her. Amanda had declined, but had stayed with Michelle for the rest of the day, goading into Michelle trying to find new powers for an hour somewhere in the mountains outside of town.\nAs long as she was with her best friend, Amanda felt fine, both physically and mentally. It was after she returned home that her own problems crept back into her mind which ended with her crying herself to sleep. When she awoke in the morning, she was sick. Amanda had to force herself to prepare Fred’s stuff so he wouldn’t stay too long when he came for it and was slightly relieved that she didn’t need to keep acting strong right now.\nAmanda’s right hand was still hurting from the slap she had given Fred. Yesterday she had seen something similar from Michelle, as she threw a man around like it was nothing. Had it been this enhanced Michelle that had slapped Fred, he would still feel it right now – and Michelle’s hand wouldn’t hurt in the very least. Given her current state, Amanda went back to her room in order to get some rest. This would be the best way for her to recover from her cold, after all. How ironic, yesterday she had planned for Michelle to become a real life super heroine – with herself as the sidekick - while now she had to worry about a simple cold. Amanda thought about the improvements that had happened to Michelle’s normal body and wondered if her friend was even able to catch a cold now. Well, even if she could, a single dose of the super potion would most likely cure her as well.\nAmanda was about to put on her PJs when it hit her. She had some of the super potion in her possession. By drinking the potion, the bleached blonde woman could practically shrug off the illness that would otherwise ruin her whole day. And to top it off this stuff would most likely turn her into a super powered goddess with unrivaled beauty and power – except Michelle of course. She threw her pajama top away and went – dressed only in her panties – to get one of the vials Michelle had given her.\nMichelle had said that these were in case something happened that required her to transform. But how much of a help would Amanda be in such a situation without any experience to be super at all? Taking out one of the vials, the blonde stared at it intently. She had declined to drink it yesterday because of her fear for negative long-term effects, but right now Amanda didn’t care about that. She slowly uncorked the vial and downed its greenish contend.\nIt took a few seconds before Amanda felt the first effects. Her whole body was engulfed in a strange mix of dizziness and numbness. The feeling grew, and Amanda feared she might lose her balance at any moment, so she sat down on her bed. She was delighted as she felt thenumbness grow weaker, but this was short-lived, since the dizziness was eplaced by another, much more uncomfortable feeling: pain. Amanda could barely remember that Michelle had told her about that, as the pain in her head increased so much, the young woman feared her head would explode. Amanda’s only consolation was that she had a good picture as to why she was having the headache of a lifetime right now. Her whole body would be prepared for the use of super powers, so the first thing to change would be the human brain that normally couldn’t handle them. She clung to this thought while her vision got blurry before disappearing altogether. For the moment, she was blind.\nHer sight slowly returned at the same time the pain receded. First she could only see a blurry image of her ceiling then she could see clear again. It didn’t stop here, though as Amanda was suddenly able to make out details she never could before. Amanda started to smile; her eyesight had reached superhuman levels and her whole body would follow suit. She stood back up and turned towards her full-length mirror. She felt healthy, and there was no sign of her cold left.\nLooking at her mirror image, she spotted the very first outside change in her body immediately. The pitch black eyes she had been rather proud of had been replaced by a fiery orange. Where Michelle’s azure eyes were just the perfect variation of a normal eye color, Amanda now sported eyes that showcased their supernatural origin.\nSince she had seen Michelle transforming before, Amanda knew the next thing to change would be her hair. She wondered whether it would be a problem, that her normally brown hair had been bleached blonde already. The moment she saw her hair fall out all at once surprised her. Amanda was terrified for a second before she remembered that Michelle’s hair had fallen out and regrown from scratch.\n“She could’ve mentioned that I’ll never have any pubic hair again,” she thought as she became aware of the fact that aside from her head there was no hair root left on her body.\nA tingling sensation on her scalp told Amanda that her hair was about to grow. She wondered what color it would be, as her eyes had already turned out different than Michelle’s. Soon she could see red threads of hair coming out of her scalp, slowly but surely turning into a fiery mane that went to the down of her back.\nSimultaneously the young woman watched her face changing. Amanda had been reasonably pretty before, but now her face became so absolutely stunning she was positive she could turn a gay man straight with a seductive smile. She chuckled as she remembered how close Michelle had come to turning her into a lesbian without neither trying nor realizing it.\nAmanda was already looking forward to the next stage of her transformation as it would affect everything besides her head. At least that was what she thought since she had seen it during Michelle’s second transformation. Michelle had never explained the difference between her first and second transformation regarding this, but Amanda soon found out that there were differences.\nThe young woman felt the strange surge of energy that had preceded every stage of her transformation. She both saw and felt how her legs began to lengthen, pushing her torso upwards which soon also started to lengthen. Amanda was just as big as Michelle was, so she correctly expected to end up with the same height her friend had after her transformation. What bugged Amanda was that while growing a foot from 5’3” to 6’3” just as expected, her body only seemed to lengthen, whereas Michelle had also gained an athletic muscle tone and those gigantic tits in the process.\nAs if on cue, Amanda felt another surge of energy going through her and she even felt how it centered on all the muscles in her body. Like a child on Christmas, she watched as she gained the same athletic build Amanda had seen on Michelle before. The fat on her body melted away while at the same time her muscles became more defined. One by one her abs became visible becoming a sexy six pack. She could see the hints of her biceps on her arm and at the same time felt her ass reshaping itself. The process happened all over her body while the feeling of her transformation was extremely arousing this time. Knowing that the muscles on her body – while not bodybuilder-sized – could lift so much more than humanly possible, helped Amanda to revel in these feelings even more.\nOnce her muscles had finished growing, Amanda put on a mischievous smile, as she knew what would happen next. The next energy surge went straight into her breasts with a force and intensity that had almost taken her over the edge. Soon Amanda realized that her body could now handle much more arousal, as her breasts started growing with the most incredible and erotic feeling she had ever felt in her life. She just stared at her breast expanding before her very eyes, not daring to touch them as this incredible feeling went through them. In a few but very intense seconds her breasts grew from B to DD, maybe even further. Amanda was pretty sure her breasts had grown slightly bigger than Michelle’s had, but she’d need to compare it to be sure.\nAmanda looked at her body and wondered why she didn’t feel the super energy Michelle had described, as another surge – no, a slow wave would be the better term – went through her body. This wave – Amanda was certain – was the super energy Michelle had spoken about, and her whole body was infused by it right now. She was sure that the previous surges had been the very same energy but instead of infusing her with powers, the energy had been used for the transformation itself. This must be the reason, why Michelle had all these previous steps at once as her body could already handle the super energy. The buildup of energy inside her felt extremely good yet but not in a sexual way. It was more like a feeling of security and confidence as if she instinctively knew about her ascension. Ironically she didn’t notice how her ascension became literal as she subconsciously lifted herself on her toes before defying gravity altogether.\nThe fact that her body was hovering several inches above the floor didn’t escape the newly transformed superwoman for long. Upon seeing her bare feet dangling above the floor, Amanda understood how different Michelle and she had conceived things yesterday. The now-redheaded woman had been irritated about how Michelle used pretty much every opportunity to showcase her flight powers while Amanda had felt really uncomfortable when Michelle shared that power with her. But now Amanda didn’t feel this uncomfortable; in fact she felt better than ever, and she knew that her own weightlessness was part of the reason why she did feel so good.\nCuriously, Amanda tried to control her flight. Just as Michelle had described, she instinctively knew how to fly around as she pleased. Sure that she possessed the same powers as Michelle, Amanda started to try out some of them. First she flexed her arms to see the muscles on them exploding into definition. Then she tried her X-Ray vision and saw how the walls around her became transparent. In this state she could actually watch any point in the city as long as she concentrated enough. During that she also got the hang of how much of her super energy was used on each power.\nThen she tried out the power, Michelle had tested out the last time she had seen her: creating a costume. Similar to her friend, she started with a leotard, but hers was blue instead of black. Amanda saw how the costume grew out of her skin and took the shape and color she had imagined. The interesting part was that her panties were visible under her leotard. Her self-made costume had grown around the only article of clothes she ad been wearing. Amanda instinctively opened up the bottom part of the leotard to put take her panties before casually repairing the leotard to its original state. All of this felt so easy that Amanda wondered how finding out new powers could be an issue at all.\nShe even added the diamond-shaped S to her costume, but eventually reversed it to a plain blue leotard. Amanda had wanted to complete the Supergirl outfit but had to admit that the whole costume creation power used up far too much power to be wasted for a game like this. Creating a cape, skirt and boots with this power would most likely use up everything she still had and Amanda was sure that her supply could be used in a better way than this.\nEager to try out more, Amanda opened the door to her balcony and hovered outside. It was still broad daylight, but the freshly transformed woman couldn’t care less about being seen as long as nobody saw her leaving her apartment. Yesterday, Michelle had demonstrated her powers in front of several witnesses, so hiding the very existence of super powers was no option any more. Rising high above the skyline in less than a second, Amanda decided what to do next.\nMichelle was confused about her encounter with James. One moment of carelessness during her first transformation and this guy had been able to track her down. If it weren’t for the absurdity of the situation, he would have easily seen through her bluff. Yes, telling someone that by drinking a certain liquid one would transform into a super powered goddess was hard to believe even if the person knew something was off – Amanda had proved this yesterday as she had discovered the enhancement on Michelle’s normal self while not believing her about the potion. The problem was that she had already shown her powers in public. Sooner or later word of a flying woman with incredible strength would reach him –maybe it already had - and once he accepted the reality of these powers, the idea of her transforming from plain Michelle to super powered goddess would sound plausible enough.\nSo with all the danger he could pose to her, why the hell had she agreed to go on a date with him? It was true that she had been interested in him from the moment she saw him, but she had also become aware that he was onto her. Why had she enjoyed his company so much that she had started flirting with him? Speaking of which, James himself had behaved strangely too. Her normal self may have been enhanced but not enough for a guy with his looks to check her out so blatantly. Michelle had actually dominated the whole conversation – despite the fact that she was such a crappy liar.\nActually, the idea of them dating also had its advantages. Not only was James a scientist, he also had connections to the police. Through him, she might get some insider information if she needed to. He may actually give her some insight about what this strange plant was and how it worked. Too bad she couldn’t tell him about either as she didn’t trust him enough – yet.\n“Who the hell are you?” Fred asked the mysterious newcomer. He had just arrived at his place and was about to get the stuff he had brought from Amanda’s place out of his trunk when he spotted a drop dead gorgeous redhead standing on his car.\n“My name? That’s a secret!” was the answer.\nThe woman wore nothing but a blue leotard that hugged her impressive curves. Still, Fred had an uneasy feeling about this. Not only was that redhead unnaturally beautiful, but she also looked down to him with flaming eyes. Fred had never heard about orange being a normal eye color, but he was sure this woman wasn’t wearing contacts.\n“H-how did you get up there?”\n“Oh I just flew around town and when I saw your car, I decided to mess a little with you.”\n“You think you’re funny, huh? Now get off there, please!”\n“I actually like it up here.” The woman now sat down on the car’s ceiling and rested her bare feet on the front window.\n“I said get off!” Fred was now visibly annoyed.\n“Oho, are you one of those guys who care more for their car than for a woman? In that case I know exactly what to do.”\nThe redhead lifted her right foot up for a bit, before she kicked it into the front window. Fred watched in horror as the window succumbed to her kick and shattered. The woman stood up, one foot on the now exposed driving seat, the other on the dashboard – both of them with shards of glass under them. She then stepped forward onto the hood. A screeching sound made it clear that there were still glass shards under her soles that now scratched off the paint. The woman finally jumped off the car.\n“Why the hell did you do that, you bitch?” Fred asked furiously – too shocked by the damage done to his car, to even realize that her bare feet should be bleeding now.\n“What? I’m not standing on your car anymore, right?” The redhead mocked, before taking a more serious expression. “And who are you calling a bitch?”\nIt finally dawned on Fred that he was not in the position to insult – let alone threaten – this woman. This wasn’t because of her threatening tone, but because of her hovering in front of him. The redhead was already big to begin with, but she became all the more intimidating by levitating a few inches above the ground. As she came closer towards him, his survival instinct kicked in and Fred turned around to run away from this strange woman.\nHis flight was short-lived as he felt her grab him and lift him up from behind –his weight held by his shirt. The redhead was carrying him higher and higher until… riiip … his shirt couldn’t carry his weight any longer and he fell at least ten feet to the ground.\n“Ahh!”\nHe tried to land on his feet, but his left leg collapsed underneath him. Fred rolled on the floor for a few feet before stopping. His whole body hurt and he cursed the fact that he hadn’t worn anything under his shirt meaning that his upper body had rubbed unprotected over the asphalt. His upper body was covered in small cuts and bruises from the asphalt, but the most painful part of his body was his left leg. His knee to be exact. Fred grabbed his knee and tried to bring his leg into a position that wouldn’t hurt so much, but he was sure that he wouldn’t be able to stand up. Then he remembered that he wasn’t alone and stared at the redhead with fear.\nThe woman showed an expression he hadn’t seen on her until now. Gone was the mocking supremacy the woman had shown while trashing his car. Gone was the threatening glare she had shown just before he tried to flee. Gone was any sign of confidence.\nThe redhead stared at him in utter horror. Her eyes where fixed on his hurting knee as if she knew exactly what was going on. She wasn’t flying anymore. Instead she took somehow unsteady steps towards him.\n“This wasn’t supposed to… I didn’t mean to…” she stammered.\nThe woman reached for his knee, but Fred slapped her hands away.\n“Get your hands of me you freak!”\nFred glared at her with furious hatred only to see tears forming in the strange redheads’ eyes.\n“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” was all she said as she retreated shortly. “But I can help.”\n“After everything you’ve done … I don’t care for your sympathy\u0026hellip; Now get lost!”\nThe pain overwhelmed Fred and he lost consciousness after saying these words. He had no idea that the redhead had said these exact words to him not too long ago. Unconscious as he was, he didn’t know that the redhead took his cellphone and made some calls, one for the ambulance to take care of him and one for her best friend to take care of her.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part04/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 04"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"Amanda Steward was sure that she would never forget this day. This morning, she had found out that her boyfriend had been cheating on her for weeks; hours later, her best friend Michelle had shown her something so unbelievable, the young woman could barely put it into words. After drinking some strange liquid, Michelle’s plain body had transformed into that of a super sexy goddess.\nWhile originally on eye level with Amanda, Michelle would now tower over her best friend by about a foot. Now, the freshly transformed amazon considered gravity her plaything as she hovered above the floor by about another foot.\nAs intimidating as Michelle had become, the fact that they were best friends seemed to remain as Michelle brought up the idea of sharing those powers with Amanda. She had already demonstrated that she could share specific powers through skin contact by making her weightless for a short time. Of course this way of power sharing couldn’t compete with drinking the same potion.\n“So what do you say? Wanna try this stuff too?” Michelle finally asked the question.\nAmanda gulped. Michelle had barely shown the extent of her incredible powers, but the few things she had shown were far more she had ever dared to dream of. Hell, the looks alone were enough to make any woman jealous and intrigued at the same time. So why did she even have to think about it? There had to be a catch.\n“I … don’t think it’s a good idea,” she muttered. Amanda avoided eye contact with her best friend for what felt like the thousandth time today. This time, it was because she had no idea how that golden-haired goddess would react, as well as her lack of a suitable explanation to decline such an offer.\nMichelle was surprised, but more of the fact that she wasn’t as surprised as she had expected to be. Earlier, Amanda had struggled with a question and Michelle had expected to be asked to share the potion with her, when her best friend only wanted the permission to tough her superhuman body. If she struggled with such a mundane request, it was not too big of a stretch she had not thought about drinking the potion too. Because of that, Michelle was curious about her friends’ decision.\n“You don’t need to drink it if you don’t want to. But I’d really like to know why you think it’s not a good idea.”\nThe sound of Michelle’s voice was calm und comforting. This allowed Amanda to look her friend in the eyes again, before sitting back on the couch.\n“I don’t really know myself. It feels so unreal. I mean, if I hadn’t watched your transformation, I would never believe that you\u0026rsquo;re the same Michelle Jenkins I’ve known for years.”\n“That’s just my appearance. I’m still the same inside.”\n“You’re sure about that? What if that stuff affects your mind? I mean I can already see differences in your behavior now.”\n“What?” Michelle asked, dumbfounded. “How do I act differently from before?”\nAmanda sighed. “For starters, you used to be extremely self-conscious about your body. Now you’re practically naked and seem totally fine with it.”\nStartled, Michelle tried to cover her breasts by crossing her arms in front of them. Her success backfired though; as all she did was showcasing how much bigger they were than before.\n”Well, first of all, it wasn’t my plan to grow right out of my pajamas! It just happened! So it’s obvious I didn’t want to repeat it. In any case though, with a body like this, I don’t need to feel self-conscious anyway!”\n“Still, you looked like you’re enjoying it a little too much. Now that I think about it, that transformation reminded me of a striptease.”\n“Ok, I admit it, I’m more confident now than I ever thought I’d be. But even my ‘normal’ body looks better than before, it doesn’t mean that the potion brainwashed me or something like that.”\n“You’re right. Still, before I drink that stuff, I’d wanna make sure there are no long-term side effects.” As she spoke, Amanda briefly thought about Fred and how she broke up with him this morning. If she were to meet him while possessing the same powers Michelle now had, things would get ugly. A shiver went down her spine. These powers were not child’s play. Wasn’t there some kind of saying about power and responsibility? No, that was from a superhero movie she’d seen. Shaking her head from her stray thoughts, she looked up at Michelle.\nMichelle just answered with an understanding nod. She wondered whether her desire to share the potion with Amanda could actually be a side effect of the potion itself. Amanda had made a good point here.\n“Say, Michelle. What are your plans for the future?”\n“What exactly do you mean?”\n“How do you plan to use your powers? Do you just want to have fun or do want to use them for good…” Amanda’s face had turned bright red as she realized how ridiculous this was “… like a superhero?”\n“A superhero…” Michelle repeated. She remembered how she had felt powerless as her colleagues were spreading more and more panic when everyone feared the meteor might hit the city. Now with her powers she felt quite certain she could protect the city from a meteor or anything else that threatened it.\n“It sounds like a good idea, actually,” Michelle concluded. “But I don’t think it’ll be easy like in the movies.”\n“Movies also have a villain that pops up shortly after the hero, so that’s probably not a good example.” Amanda said as she smiled from ear to ear. Somehow she was getting into all this superhero stuff. “First things first, you need to get something to wear in public.”\n“Actually I already bought something.”\n“You already have a costume? What color?” Amanda said, getting more excited by the second.\n“Costume? No, I just bought some casual clothes at the mall before. I don’t even know whether they fit or not.”\n“Then why are you stand- I mean floating around here naked when you have new clothes to try on?”\nMost of the lab was already dark when James Thompson entered. It was Saturday and most of his colleagues had the day off or finished their work early. This worked in James’ favor, as he had no intention to let anyone besides himself to perform DNA-tests on the only clue he had on what happened in the mountains. The rags that most likely used to be a woman’s pajama pants turned out to contain a usable sample of human hair. James had worked with the police for three months now and knew how much hair to expect in worn clothes. These pants on the other hand exceeded his expectations. It contained so many hairs that he wondered whether their original owner had shaved her legs and left the cut-off hairs inside her PJs to throw him off-track. He chuckled upon this stupid idea, and upon closer inspection he found something interesting. Almost every hair he found still had its root attached to it. Maybe it wasn’t shaved off, but actually fell out? James didn’t like the idea. If he was really searching for some kind of mutation, chances were that this mutation had also caused the hair to fall out in the first place, making it highly unlikely that it contained any evidence of such a mutation. James violently shook his head, to get himself back to topic. It made no sense to concentrate on the super strength theory officer what-was-his-name had told him, if he still had better things to try.\n“I can’t believe I’m going there again today.” Michelle said while she and Amanda were on the way to the mall. It turned out Michelle really had misjudged her new size, forcing her to wear the baggier of the two outfits she had bought. Once Michelle had dressed herself, Amanda had bombarded her with more questions about her powers, most of which Michelle couldn’t even answer herself. The time she had spent in her improved form yesterday wasn’t enough to let her discover everything her new body was capable of. Both women were more than eager to find out more about Michelle’s new abilities, but decided to wait until sundown before actually testing it out. It would be best to fly out of town for this.\nAfter they entered the mall, Michelle soon realized that bystanders had started to ogle her. Even with her baggy T-shirt, sweatpants and cheap flip-flops, people still stared at her like some kind of movie star – all because of her unnatural beauty. This was surely different than her last visit a few hours earlier. Instead of standing in her way, people made way for both her and Amanda. Michelle liked the attention she was getting, even though she was absolutely not used to be watched this way. She felt a bit bad for her friend, who didn’t attract as much attention due to being… well, normal. Then again it had been Amanda’s own decision not to drink the potion and she didn’t seem affected by it, so Michelle assumed it was fine.\nThe shopping tour itself went rather uneventful. In the end Michelle was happy that clothes for her super self wouldn’t be an issue – as long as she didn’t destroy them frequently – for the time being. She secretly yearned for an opportunity to use her powers again, but the shopping bags weren’t heavy enough for her to use her super strength. The good news was that with her not using her powers, her supply of super energy would last much longer than yesterday.\nThey spent the rest of the afternoon at Michelle’s place. Amanda had decided to plan out as much as possible for Michelle’s impending super hero career – much to the latter’s chagrin. Even though she liked the idea of using her powers to help people, she didn’t see any real need for a bright and shiny costume – especially since Amanda suggested a combination of red and blue. Even Michelle knew that these colors were present on most well-known superhero-costumes.\n“If you’re so hell-bent on planning a costume already, I’d prefer black.” Michelle said, hoping this would speed up things.\n“What do you mean with ‘already’? If you’re going to become a superhero you need a costume, and since we’ll have to make it ourselves, we can’t start too early.” Amanda actually had a point here. “And why do you prefer black?”\n“I can only transform in my free time, meaning I’ll spend most of my time patrolling at night. Black will provide a better cover at night, making it easier for me to surprise any criminal I may be hunting.”\nAmanda was about to retort something but refrained from doing so. Michelle saw that her best friend had seen her point.\n“I can see the stealth aspect, but that would only work with some kind of full body costume. And to be honest, I think your costume should be a bit more… revealing.”\n“Revealing?” Michelle repeated, raising an eyebrow. “What’s next? High Heels? I can’t run in those.”\nAmanda shook her head. “It’s more about your powers actually. You said you’re bulletproof, but the costume won’t be. So I thought something like a sleeveless leotard would be best, maybe a short skirt but that should be it. You also should think about your ability to share your powers with others. If you want to protect someone by making him invulnerable you’ll need to establish skin contact to do so.”\nMichelle couldn’t deny the logic behind it. If someone shot her it would leave a hole in her costume, and she’d have to repair it. The less the costume covered, the lower the chances of it being turned into Swiss cheese.\n“That means that a cape or high boots are just as useless right?”\nAmanda nodded.\n“Good, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want a cape to begin with.”\nOnce it was dark outside, the two women prepared for a training run. Michelle brought her backpack again, still filled with a change of clothes. She also prepared three vials filled with the super potion. Her transformation had lasted several hours now and she still felt fresh and powerful, but once she started using her powers, her energy supply would dwindle fast. The young amazon didn’t want to have to return home just when the fun started. Michelle also silently hoped that Amanda would change her mind and decide to drink the potion after seeing the real effects. Soon later the two girls were flying – Michelle shared her flight powers with Amanda – through the night sky.\n“Michelle?” Amanda insecurely asked while the latter transported them through the sky.\n“Could we stop at my place for a second? It’s getting cold out here!” Amanda didn’t mention the dizziness she felt. Her body wasn’t accustomed to the sensations of being weightless the same way Michelle’s was.\nMichelle changed course and a short while later they descended in a back alley near Amanda’s place. The young superwoman waited outside for her friend to grab some warmer clothes. She was surprised as she had not only shared her flight powers but also her invulnerability with her best friend. Whether Amanda had only thought that she was feeling cold or whether the invulnerability didn’t change her conception of temperature would remain a mystery for her. Michelle herself had absolutely no problems with the cool night air. She was still dressed in the same t-shirt and sweatpants she had worn during their shopping trip.\n“My, my. What do we have here? One poor chick that can’t even afford shoes to protect her feet from this cold night.”\nIn fact the super powered woman was standing there barefoot since she had dropped her flip-flops. This was mainly because they wouldn’t survive her testing her abilities – not to mention impractical for flying. The cold night air was just as unable to give her cold feet as this creepy voice that had surprised Michelle for not even a second. She turned around to face the source of these words.\nThe man who had snuck up from behind was a 6'7” giant which meant he towered over Michelle by 4 inches.\n“Maybe I can give you some warmth,” he said grinning.\nHe was quite muscular, but a quick look into his ugly face was enough to explain why this man was resorting to such desperation: he was butt-ugly and the expression on his face showed that the ugliness was not just limited to his appearance.\nMichelle couldn’t hide her own wicked smile. This man wanted to rape her? Big mistake! The blonde amazon waited until her “attacker” was close enough.\n“What do you say? Wanna have some fun?”\n“I’m gonna say no!” The super powered woman didn’t waste a second before grabbing her would-be-rapist. As toned as they were, her arms still looked far too slender to be able to lift the weight of another human, not to mention a grown up man bigger than herself. The man must’ve thought so as well and was obviously surprised when those slender arms lifted him up before throwing him down the street.\nHis body landed with a loud and nasty sound fifty feet away from Michelle. The man screamed in pain, causing Michelle to realize the damage she had inflicted upon him. The blonde superwoman rose into the air, hovering calmly towards her foe.\nThe man stared in horror as he realized that the woman he had attempted to rape had not only broken several of his bones – his right arm would be useless for some time – but was now flying towards him.\n“No! Keep away!”\nHe tried to hold up his left arm to protect himself from Michelle – most likely aware that this was just a useless gesture.\n“If I ever see you approach a woman without the proper respect for her,” Michelle said with a calm and intimidating voice. “Then I’ll come at you and break every bone in your body.”\nThe man – stricken with fear – nodded slightly before he turned around and ran as fast as he could. That was –given his condition – not very fast, but eventually he turned around a corner and out of Michelle’s eyes.\nPleased with her performance, Michelle turned around to find that Amanda stood behind her. The look on her friends’ face made it clear that she had seen a good deal of what had happened here – she stared at Michelle with an expression mixed of shock and awe.\n“I don’t he’ll try to rape another woman for his entire life.”\n“H-he tried to r-rape you?”\nIt seemed that Amanda had not seen this particular part, as she looked relieved upon hearing this.\n“And here I feared that you were bullying this guy just for the fun of it…”\nMichelle was a bit surprised that her best friend believed she could bully someone else, but then remembered Amanda’s reason for not drinking the potion in the first place. Michelle considered this as proof that she was still the same person from before and hoped Amanda did so as well.\nTen minutes later, the two women landed on a nearby mountain. Michelle had chosen a different place than the one she had used for her first test run as she had spotted a bigger boulder here.\n“I don’t know if I’ll grow accustomed to traveling this way,” said Amanda as she was back on solid ground. She swayed while trying to move forward, her dizziness becoming apparent.\n“From my perspective, it’s the best way to travel”\n“Maybe for you, but I get really dizzy from it. It seems like it’s a part of your powers that you can handle it so easily.”\n“That would be one of many good changes. Speaking of which, I’ll show you some other ones.”\nShe walked over to the boulder and bent down. Getting a clear grip was still the trickiest part here, especially since Michelle already knew that she would be able to lift this boulder. She thought about trying to “share her powers” with the stone boulder, but that obviously only worked on living beings. Still, with a little – and exaggerated – grunt she lifted the boulder into the air.\nEven the fact that Michelle had already told her about her super strength and had even demonstrated it on a seat and a man wasn’t able to lessen Amanda’s amazement upon seeing this display of incredible strength. Her best friend was lifting a boulder that was bigger than herself high over her head. Amanda saw how Michelle’s bare feet had sunk a bit into the rocky ground. The weight of both boulder and woman was too much for even this sturdy ground.\nSeeing how her best friend\u0026rsquo;s gaze had traveled to her feet, Michelle thought it as the best moment to show that she could also fly with this weight. She lifted off the ground for not even an inch before letting the boulder crash down next to her. Yesterday she had already discovered how much more energy she used with this weight, and she only repeated this feat to see if she could. After all, the boulder was at least thrice as heavy as the one she had lifted yesterday and she didn’t know whether there was a limit to how much she could carry while flying.\nSmiling, the young superwoman got another idea. She beckoned Amanda before explaining what she intended to do.\n“Let’s check how much of my power I can share. Try to lift the boulder while I make you super strong.”\nAmanda didn’t like this idea as she hadn’t had as much fun by sharing her best friend\u0026rsquo;s powers as one would think. Then again, a different power might not feel too uncomfortable. She had no idea that super strength had been the very first power Michelle had shared with her and that she hadn’t even felt it.\nWhen Amanda bent over to grab the boulder in a similar way to Michelle, the latter stood behind her and grabbed the back of her neck. With Amanda’s extra layers of cloth, it was harder to find the necessary skin contact for Michelle to share her powers with her. It didn’t reduce Amanda’s nervousness that a hand strong enough to support this gigantic boulder was now resting on her neck – still, she trusted her friend enough to do as she asked.\nCopying Michelle’s action from before Amanda put her hands on the boulders sides and pushed as hard inwards as she tried to lift it up. At first nothing happened.\nMichelle started to infuse Amanda with strength and invulnerability. With her improved eyesight she could see how the energy went straight to Amanda’s muscles that were straining with the enormous weight of the boulder.\nLike before, Amanda didn’t feel the energy that coursed through her body. What she did feel was that the boulder moved slowly upward. Still, all her muscles in her arm were hurting because of the strain they were under. The boulder had risen two feet from the ground when Amanda succumbed to the pain and let it fall back down. Even though she had just lifted an enormous boulder, Amanda didn’t feel proud or delighted. Michelle had been able to lift it with much more ease, so it was clear that she wasn’t able to share all her strength with her. The other point was that she herself had practically done nothing, having used a power she herself neither possessed nor felt while her friend had done the actual work. Then again this power sharing could have long term effects on Amanda’s body as well, so she asked Michelle to refrain from unnecessary power sharing for now.\nMichelle was – of course – disappointed. It wasn’t because of the limit of the super strength she could share with her friend but because it became clear that Amanda didn’t enjoy the powers as much as she had wanted her to. This way Michelle wouldn’t be able to convince Amanda of drinking the potion too, something that bugged her more and more even though she respected her friend\u0026rsquo;s decision of waiting for some long-term effects.\nThe next demonstration from Michelle was rather unspectacular from Amanda’s viewpoint. Michelle began running away and was out of sight before she even had accelerated to superhuman speed. When she returned, Amanda spotted her right before she stopped. Without using her flight powers to stop herself, Michelle left a trail in the hard ground with her bare feet. This on the other hand was impressive.\nMichelle wondered about how she was supposed to find out what else she could do. Some abilities had presented themselves directly, while others needed to be tried out. She remembered how she had subconsciously started to levitate somewhere during her initial transformation. The freshly transformed superwoman had only realized this particular part when she saw her mirror image floating above the floor. Her improved eyesight had also required no testing and the ability to sense and see the super energy didn’t either. Her super strength on the other hand had to be tried out, as she had not felt anything about it before. But the really weird case had been once Amanda had touched Michelle’s arm. The superwoman had realized immediately that she could do something new and that it required skin contact, but she had to try it to see that she was able to share her powers with others.\nMichelle tried to awaken other powers but with no success. Either she had indeed no more powers than she already knew or she still had to find the right situation for them. After about an hour of trying, she gave up and began her return with Amanda. Not wanting to startle her friend any more, Michelle carried Amanda the old-fashioned way.\nWhen they were already above the city, Michelle spotted something.\n“Seems like I have something to do,” she said before starting to descend.\n“What do you mean?”\n“There’s a fire over there and from the looks of it, there’s still someone inside.”\nAmanda didn’t ask any more. Michelle set her down on a nearby building so she could watch at a safe distance and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be spotted by any onlookers. When she saw Michelle land before the burning house and run right into it, Amanda wondered if she’d be alright. Even though she was certain of her friend\u0026rsquo;s invulnerability, she also knew that Michelle had no idea about what she was in for. There were people standing in front of the burning building, most likely its inhabitants. In the end, these people would decide whether Michelle’s first action as a super heroine would be considered a success or not.\nOnce she entered the burning house, Michelle became aware of two things. First, there was the fact that the infernal heat didn’t trouble her in the slightest. In fact, it felt much more comfortable than the ‘cold’ night air which wasn’t nearly as dangerous for an unpowered human than this heat. The other thing she realized was that the smoke here was her biggest trouble. The superwoman had little trouble breathing through it, but it made it hard for her to see anything. Even with her improved eyesight that could even see the super energy inside her body she couldn’t see any farther than a normal human could in this situation. She was practically blind.\nThrough the roar of the fire, Michelle could hear a scream for help. Unfortunately she couldn’t hear which direction it came from. Michelle started to panic. If she couldn’t find the source of that scream fast, someone would die. Suddenly Michelle felt how the super energy concentrated in her eyes. The wall of smoke that blocked her sight now became some kind of vague cloud that she could easily see through. It didn’t stop at the smoke, either. Everything, be it smoke, fire, furniture or walls, somehow became transparent to her. She was still able to tell that it was there, but at the same time she also saw what was behind it.\nReveling in this new kind of vision she possessed, Michelle soon remembered what had prompted her to awaken this ability in the first place. After a short search she had spotted a young girl who was trapped by the flames two floors above her. Michelle started to run through the flames and up the stairs. A wall of flame was blocking her path but the superwoman didn’t even think about stopping or dodging and jumped right through. Direct contact with the flames didn’t hurt her at all but instead felt good. She wondered why it felt so good and noticed far too late that her clothes had caught fire and were burning off her body. Within seconds her body was completely covered in flames, but to Michelle it felt like a rejuvenating massage.\nArriving at the second floor, the young superwoman quickly found the girl she had been searching for. That girl was no older than five and was losing consciousness as Michelle approached her. Once she reached the girl, Michelle lifted her up and immediately shared her invulnerability with the young girl. With her new X-Ray vision Michelle checked the building for any other survivors to find none – and thankfully she found no corpses either.\nKnowing that her work was done here, she jumped out of a nearby window while carrying the girl.\nMichelle used her flight powers to land gracefully in front of the burning building. In front of her was a group of naked onlookers – wait, naked? Michelle realized that her X-Ray vision was still active allowing her to see through the crowds clothes. She returned her vision to normal – again she immediately knew how to use this power. Then she realized that while the crowd that stared at her dumbfounded wasn’t naked, she herself indeed was. There was no trace of her clothes left.\nThis wasn’t how Michelle wanted it to be! In her past, she had more than one nightmare about standing in front of a group of people to find out that she was naked. These nightmares had been a manifestation of her stage fright whenever she had some kind of presentation to hold. Every time Michelle would calm herself down telling herself to imagine the audience being naked as well. Oh the irony! Now she WAS naked in front of an audience and neither the fact that she could indeed see it naked if she chose to nor the fact that she now sported the most beautiful body on the planet comforted her in the least. The superwoman recalled how she had had no qualms about practically stripping in front of Amanda before transforming. She had barely paid attention about it back then, but now she knew that this had been a sign of trust for her best friend that shy Michelle put on a show like this. The crowd before her was a whole different deal. Sure, Michelle was more confident with her body like this and had already accepted the idea of wearing a revealing costume that would show of her improved curves. But there was a limit to that and this limit had been exceeded now.\nRight now the blazing flames in the building behind her acted in her favor, since only her outline was visible for the people staring at her. Michelle also held the unconscious girl so that she blocked the sight to her breasts. Still, right now Michelle wished nothing more than to wear something that covered her private parts. She felt a tingle go over her skin, focusing on her breasts, back and her crotch. It was pleasurable yet not arousing as the location of this feeling would have suggested – Michelle was definitely not in the mood for that. She looked to see what was happening and saw a strange black substance coming out of her skin, covering her breasts and most likely parts of her back and crotch as well. It resembled black latex that looked like a fabric stretched over her body.\n“Oh my god,” she thought. “I’m growing myself a costume!”\nIn the frame of not even two seconds, Michelle’s body was now covered in a black leotard – just like Amanda and she had planned. Oh this was just great, she spent most of the day trying to find clothes for her new form and now she learned she could just create some of her own?\nA woman came out of the crowd running towards the now-clothed superwoman. “Michelle!” she yelled. “Are you alright?”\nThe superwoman was startled, she didn’t know that woman and had no idea how in the world why a stranger knew her name – especially since she didn’t even look like her normal self right now. The answer however came from the girl in her arms.\n“Mommy?” the young girl asked as she regained consciousness and turned towards the woman that now practically grabbed her out of Michelle’s arms.\nMichelle had to smile. The very first person she saved in her live happened to have the same name as her. If something like fate existed this must’ve been its way to tell Michelle that she had taken the right way. Some people started to clap and soon this had turned into a full-fledged applause for the new heroine in town. Still, the icing on the cake was seeing the overjoyed mother hugging her daughter and the grateful look she gave the young superwoman.\n“How could we ever thank you?”\nMichelle wasn’t really prepared for some meaningful answer to this question, still she was proud of what she came up with: “Live a long and happy life together!”\nWith this, the young superwoman became airborne. The crowd answered with an awed “ooh” as they saw Michelle flying away.\nOnce she was certain that she was out of sight, she returned to pick up Amanda who had watched the whole thing from where Michelle had left her.\nNO MATCH The screen in front of James informed him about what he had expected. He had compared the DNA to the entries in the criminal DNA databases he had access to. Now there was only the meteor evacuation Database. The latter had – unfortunately – been voluntary, so it only contained the DNA of about 10% of the citizens. If the owner of this hair was a hypochondriac, he had high chances of finding her. Otherwise the meteor evacuation database had been ignored by the general public. Even the TV-reporters who had been called to advertise this database had refused to participate themselves and used their support staff for filming purposes – and how high were the chances of the woman being one of them? The only thing he had learned through the DNA analysis was that he was indeed looking for a woman. As if the pink pajama pants and the fact that the hair he found in it was so short it had obviously been shaved frequently hadn’t been convincing enough. The fact that the hair had seemingly fallen out on the other hand was just as much a mystery as the things he had seen in the mountains. James leaned back in his chair, as he let the computer search the meteor evacuation database.\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part03/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 03"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"The morning sun had been shining into the apartment room for hours before its sole inhabitant finally decided to wake up.\nMichelle Jenkins had never been a deep sleeper and would normally wake up at the smallest hint of sunlight that entered her room. Taking a look at the time, the young woman saw that it was already 11 o’clock. Even on a Saturday, she rarely slept longer than 8 o’clock.Michelle was surprised how refreshed she felt and wondered how long she had been asleep. Looking back at it now, Michelle sure had paid no attention to the time. She had been preparing for bed around 10 p.m. when something unexpected happened. “Unexpected,” Michelle giggled, “that doesn’t even begin to describe it.” In fact, the young woman had accidentally swallowed a certain liquid that had caused her to transform from a plain woman into a super powered goddess. Michelle looked sideways seeing the reason for that fantastic turn of events: A strange plant that was sitting on her nightstand. It possessed strange buds that contained the very liquid that had transformed her. Another dose of that liquid would surely transform her again, Michelle thought. The idea was tempting, but the young woman knew that she possessed no clothes fitting for her amazing alter ego. “Damn,” she thought, “I should have taken measurements when I had the chance. Now I’ll have to guess what size I need.”\nMichelle finally stood up and started to dress herself. Soon she was reminded of the final discovery she had made before going to bed. Even though she had returned to normal, there were still some slight differences to how she was before her initial transformation. The plain brunette could have sworn that her hair looked healthier and that she had lost some pounds. Now her clothes confirmed the latter as they fit a bit more loosely than she was used to. Michelle was alright with that since she didn’t want to buy new clothes for her mortal form too. Now fully dressed Michelle entered her kitchen to prepare breakfast. She wasn’t actually hungry, but habit and appetite didn’t allow her to leave the apartment on an empty stomach. She wondered whether it would suffice to guess her new measurements. After all, she could still drink a tiny amount of the liquid so that the young woman would turn return to her amazon form long enough to take her measurements. She dismissed the idea again. Not only didn’t she know how exactly the amount of liquid related to the time spent in goddess mode, Michelle also feared that she wouldn’t want to transform back to normal just to buy some clothes. She concluded that she had to buy clothes based on her guess and if she was wrong, the young woman could still return the clothes and change them for others. Michelle was so consumed in her thoughts that she didn’t realize how she ate at least twice as much as she would normally.\nJames Thompson hated his job right now. One might say being a scientist working on the very meteor responsible for the recent evacuation of the entire city would be an interesting project. The problem was that James had actually nothing to do with the meteor. His superiors had used both his youth and his fitness as an excuse to shove him away. Now he was stuck with field work. While the meteor was locked away in an underground laboratory James was forced to look at whatever the police considered meteor-related. This varied from missing pets to people that claimed they were infected by an alien killer virus that turned out to be the flu. Nothing had any real connection to the meteor which meant that James was wasting his time. The police also realized that and started to milk his support for all it was worth. He was called to some actual crime scenes – under the premise of being meteor-related - and handed him evidence needed for DNA-tests. The look on his colleagues’ faces whenever he forced them “to do the CSI thing” was practically the only thing that kept him motivated. This time he was called to a mountain range outside the city. The endless drive had soon sucked up what little motivation he had left, but when he arrived at the site, only two officers were waiting for him.\nWhen James left his car, he could already hear them talking. “This is the scientist? I expected someone smaller.” Whoever first said that “a healthy mind lives in a healthy body” had never been to high school where both were mutually exclusive. While high school could be hell for geeks, James was now facing the other side of the medal. He looked too much like an athlete to be taken seriously as a scientist at first glance by others. Most of their colleagues had learned that James was knowledgeable enough for his profession and soon changed their attitude towards him. The reason why these two had not worked with him over the last three month was most likely because the ‘crime scene’ was somewhere in the wilderness.\nThe older one of the policemen greeted him. “Hi, I’m Officer Neil Brown and this is my partner Isaac Smith.” James introduced himself and waited for Officer Brown to continue. “We called you here because some strange things seem to have happened here in the last 24 hours.” James looked around, seeing only rocks and boulders lying around. “I use this path for my morning run every day. So I know this place like the back of my hand, and I know when something is off.” Officer Brown walked towards a nearby boulder and gestured James to follow. Officer Smith didn’t seem too interested as he waited by their car, yawning when he thought nobody was looking. The older policeman continued his story while the two men walked to that boulder. “Whenever I come here I take a break and lean on this boulder. Sitting down isn’t good when you’re jogging and this boulder is just the right size for me. I think a smart guy like you can tell me why I didn’t so this morning, right?” For a second, James felt offended thinking that the middle aged officer was mocking him. The boulder was covered in dirt and the officer had obviously not wanted to sully his clothes with it. But something was strange about the amount of dirt on this boulder. James looked around and found a hole a few feet next to the boulder and found the reason why it was covered in dirt.\n“That boulder used to lie here,“ James said, pointing at the hole, “and someone had turned it around and left it here.”\nOfficer Brown smiled, “Yes, that’s what I think too, but there’s a tiny problem with that. That thing’s too heavy to be lifted without fitting equipment, so I checked for traces of that. Unfortunately I didn’t find any trace…”\n“The ground is hard here,” James interrupted. “It hasn’t rained for some time so it’s not that surprising that the equipment didn’t leave any trace on the ground.\u0026quot;\nOfficer Brown chuckled, as if to tell that he had thought about this possibility too. He bent down and pointed his finger before him. James’ eyes followed his lead to stop at a trail that was left behind, just not by some equipment.\n“Tell me Mister Thompson. With a solid and dry ground like this, how much does a human need to weigh in order to leave such a deep footprint?”\nJames couldn’t believe it. There were human footprints, about two centimeters deep into the hard ground. He stomped with his right foot onto the ground as hard as he could, but didn’t even leave an imprint of his shoes sole on it. One would have to weigh at least a ton to make such a deep footprint.\n“Are there more footsteps like this?”\nOfficer Brown shook his head, “The only ones are right here next to the boulder. If it didn’t sound so stupid, I’d say the person who left these footprints did so because she was carrying the boulder at that time.”\nIt indeed sounded stupid, but James had to consider that possibility. No human could lift such a boulder but no human could leave such a footprint either. “Is there anything else that you saw during your morning run?”\nThe older policeman just walked towards a small crater that had totally escaped James’ attention. “Don’t tell me that this is also new!” The policeman turned to look where his partner was standing. “I didn’t tell this to Isaac since I can barely believe it myself. But whoever caused this crater…,” he opened his jacked and took out an evidence bag that contained some pink rags “… left her pajama pants here.”\nAfter her breakfast Michelle did not waste any time and drove to the mall to get some new clothes. Since it was Saturday, the mall was filled with people and the young woman wasn’t able to get to her favorite shop as fast as she wanted. Eventually she made it and started to look for clothes that she “would give to a friend.” There was a black dress that might fit her enhanced form, but Michelle didn’t dare to buy it without knowing for sure. Guessing her own measurements proved harder than she expected and in the end she settled for a pair of jeans and a –hopefully – formfitting T-shirt as well as a pair of sweats with an oversized T-shirt as an alternative outfit. It was clear that she would have to return in her enhanced form next time and actually try the clothes on beforehand. The young woman was happy that she didn’t need to buy new underwear as her panties had survived her initial transformation and a bra would be wasted on those gravity defying spheres of flesh she sported in her enhanced form. Michelle went to the cash desk to pay as she spotted a rack full of cheap flip-flops. “Damn” she thought, she had almost forgotten that her feet would grow like the rest of her body and grabbed a pair of flip-flops. Most other kinds of shoes wouldn’t be so forgiving when it came to guessing the wrong size, after all. The young woman returned to her car as fast as she could, her heart beating faster and faster in anticipation of returning to her godlike form that could fill the clothes she had just bought.\nJames still couldn’t believe what he had seen in the mountains. Even after the officers Brown and Smith had left, he had searched the whole area for another sign of … whatever had happened there. He had actually been lucky as he found a scar on the ground but that didn’t tell him anything new. It could have easily been made using a shovel, but James was convinced that it was connected to the moved boulder or the crater. The real problem would be finding a scientific explanation for all of this.. He remembered Officer Brown’s theory about the footprints being made by the person who had carried the boulder and tried to dismiss it. Unfortunately the idea of a super strong human being explained almost everything he had seen there except the fact that super strength belonged into comic books and action movies, not in the real world. He looked at the ragged pajama pants he had been given and hoped that they contained usable DNA-samples. James started to smile, for the first time in three month he was excited about his job.\nMichelle all but ran up the stairs leading to her apartment, barely able to hide her growing anticipation during the drive back home. Once inside, she threw the bags containing the new-bought clothes into a corner and walked right up to the plant on her nightstand. The buds on this plant contained the liquid that would cause her transformation into … Michelle’s thought came to a halt. Shouldn’t she think about a name for her super powered alter ego? No, that could wait until later. What’s important now, was that she was back home and had nothing more to do than drink that liquid. Everything else would be decided afterwards. The glass she had used last night was still standing next to the plant, so she took it and held it under one of the buds. Carefully the near-sighted woman touched that bud and was delighted as she saw a greenish liquid start to drip out of that bud and into her glass. After a few seconds the glass was half-full and the bud stopped to emit the liquid having shrunk down noticeably in the process. Michelle held the glass on eye-level and looked at it, amazed about the fact that this liquid would transform her into a living goddess, easily capable of feats she hadn’t even dreamed of 24 hours ago. She was tempted to drink it right away but she preferred not to rip her clothes apart as she did with her pajamas last night. The young woman sighed, put the glass down, and started to undress herself. She was a bit surprised by her own impatience. Ever since she had woken up, she had longed to return to being the goddess she had been last night, and everything that had prolonged that wait had been an annoyance. A part of her felt anxious about that, wondering whether her initial transformation had been so intoxicating that she was already addicted to it.\nHaving stripped down to her underwear, Michelle was about to unhook her bra when she was surprised by the sound of her doorbell. “Oh come on,” she thought. “Why am I interrupted just when the good part starts?” The barely clothed woman considered ignoring whoever it was that stood before her apartment door, but then decided to at least take a look. She sneaked towards the door and looked through the spyhole. On the other side was Amanda Steward, Michelle’s best friend since high school. From the look in Amanda’s eyes, Michelle could see that something was wrong. She knew when her best friend faked a smile, and she also knew that Amanda rarely dropped by unannounced. Michelle opened the door just enough to let her head be seen – just in case Amanda wasn’t alone – and greeted her friend.\n“Hi, you free?” the faked smile in Amanda’s face was already fading, showing that she practically pleaded for Michelle to answer “Sure, come in!” She opened the door further to let her friend enter, before adding, “Sit down in the living room while I finish changing my clothes.” Amanda was obviously surprised by the fact that Michelle was only dressed in her underwear right now, but didn’t ask why. Michelle went back to her room and quickly put on the blouse and the pair of jeans she had taken off mere moments ago. Once finished, she joined her best friend in the living room. “Want something to drink?” she tried to take the initiative. “A coffee would be fine.”\nOnce Michelle had finished preparing two cups of coffee, she sat down on her armchair facing Amanda who was sitting on her usual spot on the couch. Michelle hoped that her friend would tell her what was bugging her but instead she found that Amanda was watching her with a puzzled look.\n“Something on my face?” Michelle asked and immediately regretted doing so.\n“Your hair, it looks … different that the last time we met.”\nAmanda’s answer reminded Michelle of the side effects, her first transformation had upon her looks. “I didn’t notice anything,” Michelle lied. “You must be imagining things”.\nAmanda raised an eyebrow, showing that she was not convinced. The fact that the two women were best friends had enabled Michelle to see her friends’ trouble with a single glance. The very same fact made it next to impossible for them to lie to each other. Amanda didn’t let the topic slide now.\n“I’m pretty sure you\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that your hair looks better than it did the day before yesterday.”\nWhile speaking, Amanda’s voice had taken an annoyed tone and her jet black eyes had been locked onto Michelle’s brown ones. Michelle was alarmed by how easy her friend lost her patience now and decided answer with a single nod. She turned her head slightly, avoiding eye-contact as she added, “I didn’t want to brag about it.”\nAmanda seemed to realize how uncomfortable her best friend felt. “Sorry I’m kind of short-tempered today, since…,” Amanda trailed off, her gaze now focused on the cup of coffee on the table in front of her.\n“Don’t sweat it!” Michelle tried to reassure her friend, hoping she would finally reveal what was troubling her.\nAmanda nodded, leaned forward to grab her cup and took a sip of coffee. “By the way, have you been working out?” Amanda asked, changing the topic again.\n“No, I haven’t,” was Michelle’s immediate answer. Even in the short while that Amanda had seen Michelle’s body, she had already recognized the fact that Michelle had lost some weight. This time, Amanda seemed convinced by her answer – after all, it was the truth.\n“That’s good to hear. I mean, we had promised to start going to the gym together and for a moment I thought you had abandoned me and started on your own. I don’t think I could handle another betrayal.”\nMichelle watched as her best friends head sunk ever lower and her bleached blonde hair fell into view, covering Amanda’s eyes and hiding the tears that were forming in them. Through the words ‘abandoned’ and ‘betrayal’ Michelle had already a clear picture about what had driven Amanda to her unexpected visit. Still, if she wanted to comfort her friend Michelle needed to know instead of guessing, so she asked, “What happened?”\nAfter a short moment of silence, Amanda finally answered. “Fred and I broke up.” Another moment of silence, Michelle knew that all she could do was to wait until Amanda continued on her own. She remembered that Fred and Amanda had been going out for six months.\n“You remember how he stayed at his parent’s place for almost a month after the meteor crash?” Amanda continued.\n“Yes,” was all Michelle whispered, she would have nodded if Amanda were facing her instead of looking to the ground.\n“It seems like he met someone else while he was over there. Once he was back in town, he didn’t treat me like he did before, but I didn’t think too much of it.” Amanda was now visibly crying. Not even the curtain of hair could hide the tears that ran down her face. “He even said that his parents were renovating their house and went there every weekend to help them. Of course, that was a lie.” She took out a handkerchief and wiped away her tears. “This morning I called him, but instead of him, another woman answered his cell. The poor girl was just as surprised as me, didn’t even switch off the phone while yelling at him for two-timing.” Amanda chuckled and lifted her head, to reveal that she had indeed stopped crying. “Now that I think about it, I don’t even miss him that much. It’s just that he lied to me and played me for a fool. That gets me.” She brushed back her hair, her lips turning into a faint smile. “That guy betraying my trust just shows that he didn’t deserve it in the first place. Anyway, I’m back on the market!”\nThere was one thing Michelle had always envied about Amanda and that was her positive attitude. “Don’t tell me you’re already over him!” Michelle stated her disbelief. Any other woman would have mourned for weeks over the breakup but Amanda had worked through this in a matter of minutes. Michelle couldn’t accept that her friend recovered that fast.\n“Come on, Michelle, all I need to do to get over it is a good friend that hears me out and doesn’t lie to me like that ex-boyfriend of mine. But if we keep this topic up, I may start to cry again, so … how the hell did your hair get so healthy looking?”\nAfter all this rambling about trusting each other Michelle didn’t feel like lying to Amanda. If she wanted to transform frequently she would have to tell her eventually. The longer she waited, the more it would hurt Amanda to have been lied to all the time. Yes, telling Amanda was the right thing to do. Not only could Michelle trust her, she might also share the spoils with her.\nShe sighed before saying in a serious tone, “What I’m telling you now will stay a secret between us, ok?” Amanda looked confused, but nodded nonetheless. “Remember the strange plant that I’m growing in my room? This plant produces a certain liquid. I don’t know what it is, but my new hair is just an unimportant side effect of what that stuff can really do! I accidentally drank that stuff and turned into some kind of goddess…”\nMichelle stopped as she saw Amanda shaking her head.\n“What?”\nAmanda looked at her with a strange expression that looked like a mix of concern and how a mother must look when she tells her child the truth about Santa Clause.\n“Do you really think that a strange liquid from a plant turned you into a goddess? Sounds more like a hallucinogenic drug to me.”\nMichelle hadn’t expected this kind of reaction. When she thought about it, the events of last night had been far too unreal for anyone to believe this story. One had to see it in order to believe it.\n“If you don’t believe me, I just have to show you! I’ll be right back.”\nWith that, Michelle rose from her chair and walked towards her bedroom. After a short while she returned, now dressed only in bra and panties. Amanda was puzzled by the sight of it, especially since she remembered how Michelle had greeted her just like that. The half-naked woman presented now a strand of hair.\n“This is my original hair,” she exclaimed “when I drank this…” she presented a glass containing a greenish liquid, “it fell out and was replaced by new hair, while my whole body improved beyond what you have seen so far.”\nAmanda didn’t know how to react; Michelle’s story sounded like a drug trip, but the hair she held in her hand indeed looked like how her hair used to look the last time they met. Maybe that stuff is really responsible for her improvements was the conclusion Amanda came to, but she was still pretty sure her friend was fantasizing. Michelle put the strand of hair onto the table, followed by her glasses. “Now sit back and watch the show!” was all she said before putting the glass to her mouth and gulping down its contents.\nThe moment it entered her mouth Michelle could already feel the amazing effects the liquid had on her. It tasted better than anything she’d ever had and wondered for the fraction of a second, that this may be a different liquid than the one that had transformed her before. But then she noticed the familiar feeling of super energy in her tongue and knew that her sense of taste had been amplified. Michelle immediately understood that this transformation would be different than last time as her body was already capable of handling the super energy provided by the liquid. She felt how the energy seeped into her brain, preparing it for the incredible amount of information her heightened senses would provide it with. What had been the worst headache of her life during her first transformation, felt so good and natural now, it was unreal. Since there were no outside changes yet, Michelle decided to show off her ascension as much as possible.\nMichelle bent over and placed the glass back on the table. She then lifted her head and looked Amanda straight in the eyes.\nAmanda returned the gaze, expecting to see the first signs of intoxication in her friends’ eyes. What she saw was quite different. Michelle’s eyes started to take on an azure hue that quickly replaced the brown Amanda had been accustomed to.\n“Y-y-your eyes…” Amanda stammered, but Michelle just put her finger before her mouth.\n“Shhhh, wait until it’s over, for now you just look.”\nThe transforming woman said this with a melodious voice that made Amanda immediately understand why she had used the term goddess before. Michelle was still bent over as Amanda saw that the strange transformation wasn’t limited to her hair, eyes or voice but was indeed spreading over her face that transformed into the most beautiful face Amanda had ever seen.\nMichelle reveled in her friends’ astonished look knowing that this was just the tip of the iceberg. She felt the energy go through her scalp and into her hair. It was no surprise to her that her hair didn’t fall out like last time; still she hadn’t expected to actually feel the changes coursing through it.\nAmanda’s eyes opened wide as she saw Michelle’s brown hair, hair that had already improved since the last time they had met, turning into a golden blonde mane that would have gone to her butt but instead was coming closer to the table in front of her – thanks to Michelle still bending over towards Amanda. Michelle finally straightened back up, throwing her hair backwards in the very same movement as if to prove that it indeed reached to her butt. Amanda could already feel her jealousy flame up as she realized how plain her own bleached hair looked compared to what her best friend sported now. She didn’t even want to try to compare their faces now.\nWith the changes in and on her head completed, Michelle found another difference to her first transformation. Where yesterday each body part had transformed one after another, she could feel that the energy had already completely expanded inside her body and would cause all her further transformations at once.\nMichelle’s arms reached behind her back and Amanda immediately understood what her friend intended. As her best friends bra became unhooked and fell to the ground, Amanda stared her with a dumbfounded look and only look and only one thought: “Don’t tell me they are going to grow?” Michelle lifted her arms over her head, making her A-cup rise a bit higher.\n“Too bad it had to happen this way,” Michelle thought. She had intended to use her expanding breasts as the grand finale. Now it would be just one of many changes. She felt how the energy had reached a critical point as was about to unleash the transformation in every remaining part of her body at once.\nAmanda could have sworn that some kind of wave had just washed over Michelle’s body as she suddenly started to grow. Amanda’s eyes were fixated on her best friend\u0026rsquo;s breasts that were expanding at an alarming rate, and she took a few seconds to realize that these weren’t the only parts of her best friend\u0026rsquo;s body that was growing. Michelle’s arms, legs, and torso were getting longer at the same time as her breasts expanded.\nThe energy inside her body were let loose and caused a cacophony of pleasant sensations that assaulted Michelle’s brain. A normal brain wouldn’t have been able to handle it and even in her current stage, Michelle struggled with the sheer ecstasy caused. It was like her whole body was massaged by a thousand experienced hands, each cell caressed to unlock its full potential.\nAmanda’s eyes went up and down on her best friend\u0026rsquo;s almost naked body, trying to see every change but not knowing where to look in what order. The spectator’s eyes were suddenly locked on her best friends’ tummy that now sported an incredible six pack, realizing that her muscles had grown as well.\nThe transforming woman subconsciously lifted onto her bare toes and noticed just in time that her flight powers had activated before leaving the ground. With little effort Michelle stopped her involuntary flight – she preferred to wait until Amanda would give it her full attention.\nAmanda was still trying to discover every single change upon Michelle’s now 6’3” frame that she didn’t realize that the transformation was already over – or that she was staring at her best friend open-mouthed with an expression one would expect on a teenage girl locked in a room with her favorite boygroup.\nMichelle watched in silence as a dumbfounded Amanda ogled her. Obviously the whole transformation was hard to swallow, so she waited until her friend had recovered from the initial shock. She wondered how long she should wait before she showed off the incredible powers that had come with that gorgeous body of hers. Her whole body was buzzing with power. The amount of energy inside her was at least twice as much as yesterday. Michelle wondered how much of the liquid she had drunk yesterday. It was highly likely that a big deal of her initial supply had been used up by her first transformation. Now her body was already able to handle the super energy and transformed in a more efficient way, effectively increasing the supply she had afterwards.\nAfter a few minutes Amber finally broke the silence.\n“What in the hell just happened?”\n“As I told you, I turned into some sort of super powered goddess.” Michelle answered matter-of-factly, still unaware how different her own voice sounded now.\nAmanda shook her head either in disbelief or to prove to herself that she was not hallucinating. “You… sure look like one. “ Michelle found it sweet how Amanda avoided eye-contact while saying that.\n“Wait a second, did you just say super powered?” Amanda looked at her with curious expectation.\nMichelle started small, demonstrating her super strength by lifting the armchair she had been sitting on earlier into the air with no effort.\n“Coooool,” Amanda said, eager to see more.\nThis reminded Michelle that the powers she could demonstrate were limited. “I can’t really show you much else,” she explained. “I’m invulnerable or at least really tough, I can see the very energy needed for these powers and I can run really fast but I have to watch my strength. And if I really use my strength…” she flexed her right arm as hard as she could. Amanda gasped as she saw the muscles on that arm grow to bodybuilder-size, before Michelle continued, “…then this happens. But my absolute favorite is this.”\nWithout further explanation, Michelle activated her flight powers. She felt herself becoming lighter and lifted herself onto her toes and then into the air. Amanda rose from the couch, watching the airborne woman intently.\n“I can’t believe this is happening,” she said while circling around her friend-turned-goddess. “How does it feel?”\nMichelle was at a loss for words. “I can’t really describe it. It’s just out of this world, I feel like I could do anything I wanted.”\nAmanda had stopped circling her friend and was now standing in front of Michelle again. “And this stuff comes from that strange plant you’re growing?” she asked.\nMichelle nodded.\n“I’d like to… I mean…” Amanda began to struggle as she did whenever she asked something embarrassing.\nMichelle could already guess what Amanda wanted. After witnessing her transformation into an incredibly sexy amazon with powers that exceeded her wildest dreams, it was only natural to have this happen to herself as well. Michelle wondered if it had been too early to tell Amanda where the super potion came from. Then again, she had no qualms about sharing the wealth with her best friend.\nAmanda took a deep breath before finally asking “M-may I touch you?”\nThis was not what Michelle had expected. Now it was her turn to look dumbfounded while her best friend – again – turned her head slightly away from her, unable to hide the fact that it turned deep red. She then remembered that she was practically naked and figured that this contributed to Amanda’s embarrassment.\n“Um, sure.” Michelle didn’t really want to hinder her friends’ curiosity. “Help yourself!” She held out her arm in Amanda’s direction and gracefully landed back on the ground.\nAmanda hesitantly reached out and touched Michelle’s right arm. A short while ago this arm had sported muscles big enough to fit a bodybuilder, but now it was just slim and toned. Amanda was surprised of the smoothness of the bronze skin she was touching. Having heard of her best friends’ invulnerability, she had expected something rougher. The bleached blonde tested out her luck by trying to squeeze Michelle’s relaxed biceps – only to find that right below the smooth skin the softness ended since her biceps was as hard as steel.\nWhile Amanda tried to satisfy her curiosity, Michelle had made an interesting new discovery. The moment her best friend touched her arm, the gorgeous amazon felt a strange new sensation regarding her. It was as if her body asked her how to handle the person touching her. Michelle barely recognized the subconscious question before realizing that she had – just as subconsciously – answered that Amanda was her best friend. The super powered woman felt some kind of connection building up between herself and her friend. Somehow she knew that this connection would break once they didn’t touch each other anymore. When Amanda squeezed her biceps, she decided to test out what this connection was about and flexed her arm as hard as she could, returning it back to bodybuilder-size.\nAmanda was obviously surprised as her hand was pressed outward by the expanding muscle tissue underneath Michelle’s arm. She felt how her friend’s arm became slightly warmer, but was totally unaware of the connection Michelle had established.\nWith her improved eyesight, Michelle was easily able to determine what this connection did. The super energy in her arm was converted into super strength as she flexed it. A small amount of this super strength wandered into Amanda’s hand that still gripped her with all her might which was now far beyond human capacities yet still just a fragment of what Michelle was capable of. Which a mere touch, Michelle had shared some of her super strength with her friend – and only her super strength. Michelle relaxed her arm and stopped the flow of super strength into Amanda’s body. It took only a few seconds for the remaining super strength inside Amanda to dissipate – obviously Amanda’s mortal body lacked the capability of storing this power or sensing it’s presence for that matter.\nAmanda had mixed feelings over the whole situation. On the one hand, she was intimidated by her friends’ new powers, powers that could easily be used to bring death. On the other hand just now she felt more protected and secure than she had felt ever in her life.\nHaving decided to try another variant of her power sharing, Michelle activated her flight powers. She made sure to send her power over Amanda’s arm to her whole body. She started to smile as she felt herself leaving the ground and saw, that her best friend did just the same.\n“Whoa, I’m starting to feel dizzy.”\n“Being weightless does that to you.”\nAmanda looked down and saw what Michelle meant. Not only her friend, but Amanda as well were hovering a foot above the floor. Startled, Amanda let go of Michelle’s arm. With their connection separated, Amanda floated down as gravity slowly reclaimed its rule on her.\n“What did you just do? Telekinesis?”\n“I shared my power off flight with you.”\n“You can share powers with me?”\n“It seems so, but only as long as we have skin contact. The powers I share are much weaker than my own, though. And you basically don’t have any means to control them, so this isn’t the best way for you to get to know these powers.”\n“You make it seem like there’s a better way.”\n“Of course there is! Drinking the same potion as me should have a similar effect on you, don’t you think?”\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part02/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 02"},{"categories":["Povídky"],"contents":"It was already dark, when Michelle Jenkins returned to her apartment. She was exhausted, the last weeks had taken a toll on her and she was really glad that the weekend had finally arrived.\nNormally she would have been faster at work, but recent events had caused her to doubt her job. The news that the recently discovered meteor could possibly crash into the city had shocked her just as much as anybody else.\nBut what really disturbed Michelle was the way the media, including the TV station she was working for, handled this topic. Instead of calming down their viewers, they increased their fears by painting a colorful doomsday scenario. This only caused unnecessary panic. Three month ago the meteor crashed in a corn field –five miles outside the evacuated city. When Michelle was on her way back to her apartment – having spent the last days at her parent’s place – she had found a strange seed on the sidewalk. The young woman decided to keep it as memento and a sign of a new start, now that the meteor posed no more threat.\nNow, three months later, this seed had grown to a plant, that was a foot and six inches tall, had no leaves but several things that looked like buds. A week ago the plant had stopped growing in height and the buds were the only things that showed any sign of growth as they grew a bit rounder, but it seems as if those would never bloom.\nMichelle was somehow fascinated about this plant, even though she had no idea what that plant actually was. When she wasn’t able to find anything on the net about such a plant, she thought that the seed may have been part of the meteor that had crashed down, but eventually, she dismissed the idea. Actually, she was right.\nUnfortunately, she found her job to be less interesting as it was before the meteor affair. The fact that the media had caused more trouble than the meteor itself had gotten to her. If she had been the anchorwoman she would have done everything to calm the masses down instead of increasing their fear. But Michelle only wrote some articles, she wasn’t allowed to present them. Michelle was 25 years old, 5’3” tall, near-sighted and rather plain looking. With this there were little chances that the young woman would ever be seen in front of the camera. Earlier Michelle had been fine with that but now she was demotivated and the work that once had excited her became a chore that she had trouble getting done. In order to counter her decreasing motivation she took a few vitamin pills every night right before going to bed. This night was no exception. She put her glass of water on her nightstand, right under the strange plant and opened the nightstand itself to take out her vitamin pills. For the few seconds that she was distracted, one of the buds moved over the glass and a small drop of a green liquid flowed out of it and dropped into the water beneath it. Michelle didn’t see that as she was just putting down her glasses. She sat down on her bed and swallowed her pills and drank the water and the green liquid with it.\nIt didn’t take long for her to realize that something was wrong. She felt a strange surge going through her body and started to feel lightheaded. The dizziness grew and she fell onto her bed, hoping that this would help her recover. Unfortunately it got even worse. Her vision became blurry, and her dizziness was replaced by pain, slowly turning into the worst headache she ever had. Michelle grimaced in pain and she closed her eyes in the process. It only took a few minutes, but for her it felt like a lifetime, until the pain dissipated and she was able to open her eyes again.\nMichelle was surprised by the clarity of her vision. She could now see details on her ceiling that, she was sure she couldn’t make out even when wearing her glasses. As she got back up and looked around her room. It was not her imagination; her sight had suddenly gotten much better than she thought was humanly possible!\nMichelle stood up and went to her full length mirror. Looking at her mirror image, the young brunette saw that her brown eyes had turned into a bright blue, almost as if her eyes were glowing. She felt another surge going through her whole body and into her head. Michelle wondered whether another round of dizziness and pain awaited her, but instead her hair fell out. She gasped in shock as she saw her hair fall down and looking at her arms, she saw that the few hairs on her arm had also fallen out. It was clear that any hair on her entire body had fallen out. Her improved eyesight revealed the fact that her arm now lacked hair roots. In horror the former brunette looked at her bald heads reflection and was relieved to find that there were at least still hair roots there. As if on cue, her scalp started to tingle and as she watched her reflection, she could see blonde hair sprouting from her head, growing at a tremendous rate. All the horror at seeing her hair fall out disappeared. Her old hair had been a mousy brown, while her new hair was golden blonde and seemed to emit the same strange glow as her eyes.\nWhile her hair was growing, Michelle realized that her face was changing as well. Any imperfection was disappearing from her face and her nose slimmed down a little bit. She smiled at the mirror only to see that even her teeth looked perfect. “Wow, I’m … gorgeous,” she said to herself as if to confirm that what she was seeing was really her face.\nWhen her hair stopped growing, it reached down to her butt. Somehow Michelle wasn’t surprised when another surge went through her body. It didn’t take long for her to realize what it did, she felt her legs and torso lengthen, causing her to grow in height. Michelle wondered why her growth didn’t hurt in the very least. In fact she enjoyed the feeling of her body lengthening. While her pajama didn’t feel tight, she saw how it became too short for her body. Originally her pajama pants had reached down to the floor, covering part of her feet when she lay in bed. Now the bottom part rose high above her ankles and was about to reveal her calves. Her pajama top didn’t look better; her arms grew longer, so they were only covered a little further than her elbow. Since her torso had grown as well, her belly was exposed a little further than her navel right now. And while it had been a little pudgy before it was now slim. When her growth stopped, Michelle thought that she should be at least 6’3” tall.\nMichelle was overwhelmed with her new look, but another surge told her, that her amazing transformation wasn’t finished yet. This time it affected her whole body. The already thin woman felt the last of her body fat disappear while all her muscles started to grow. It felt even better than the last spurt. Michelle watched as her exposed belly turned into a six pack and saw her skin developing a nice tan as well. Her butt reshaped itself – becoming round and firm in the process. When the growth subsided, Michelle was a little relieved. She didn’t want to look like a body builder and was therefore happy, that she ended up looking ‘only’ like a fitness model – her poor pajamas stretched to its limits across her torso.\nJust as Michelle thought that her transformation had finally finished, she felt another surge, this time going straight into her breasts. “Whoa…,” was all she could say, as her breasts started to expand. The feeling of her breasts expanding was incredible. Her nipples became erect and pushed against the fabric of her pajama. While her previous spurts had lasted for about a minute, her breast growth happened much faster. Her pajama top finally gave in and ripped in front of her chest, allowing Michelle to see her new assets for the first time. She hurriedly took of the remains of her pajama top, while her breasts finished their transformation from As to DDs.\nMichelle couldn’t believe it. In less than 10 minutes she had transformed into a living wet dream. She wondered if she was dreaming, since she WAS about to go to bed when this started. But it had felt too good to just be a dream. Michelle felt yet another surge going through her body. Unlike the other surges that washed over her body in an instant, this one went slowly. It couldn’t even be described as a surge, more like energy building up in her body. Once it had covered every part of her body, Michelle saw that her whole body emitted the same strange faint glow that her eyes and hair did.\nThis time, Michelle was right in believing that her transformation was over. She could still feel the strange energy and when she concentrated on that feeling, the enhanced woman realized that it was faintly getting weaker as time went on. Eventually it would dissipate and Michelle instinctively dreaded the moment this would happen. Somehow she knew that it was this very energy that had transformed her and if it dissipated, so would her transformation. She couldn’t explain why she thought that, but the more the young woman thought about it, the more she was convinced that her transformation was limited and that it would end once the energy was used up. But why would her body need the energy to sustain such a transformation in the first place? Unfortunately the answer didn’t pop up right in her mind, so all she could do was make the best out of it. She started to check out her new body once more.\nLooking at her naked upper body, Michelle was amazed how her breasts didn’t sag despite their size. Sure, her pectorals seemed to be strong enough to easily support them, but still it looked like they actually defied gravity. She looked at the rest of her body, going over her six pack and her shapely legs – still clad in her pajama pants – down to her bare feet.\nMichelle gasped as she arrived at her feet. What caused her gasp was not the fact that her feet, like every other part of her body, had been perfected during her transformation. No, that was something the freshly transformed girl was expecting. She gasped because her feet weren’t touching the ground anymore. Her body was hovering a few inches above it. It took a few seconds before Michelle had swallowed this new revelation. Her strange transformation had not only given her the most beautiful body she could imagine, it had also given her the ability to fly under her own power.\nSeeing her feet dangling inches above the floor, Michelle couldn’t help but smile in joy. This made her rise a few more inches in the air. Michelle tried to control her new ability and found she could easily do so. Be it rising higher or landing on the ground, it was like she instinctively knew how to do it. She flew around in her room for a bit before landing in front of her mirror again.\nSince her body could now easily pass as a fitness model, she wanted to see how a double biceps pose looked on her new body. When Michelle started to flex each biceps, she felt how the energy in her arms started to intensify. She watched as each biceps started to grow even bigger and the neighboring muscles joining them until her arms looked like they belonged to a bodybuilder – a male bodybuilder. Startled, she released her flex and felt her arms return back to how they were before. The young woman wondered how much strength she possessed. It wouldn’t surprise her to learn that she had super strength. The best way of finding out whether this was true would be testing it out, but she didn’t want to do that in her room. Michelle feared that she might break something if she really had super strength. So she decided to go out and test her body at a remote place.\nThis was a problem: the freshly transformed amazon had just ripped through her pajamas and it was obvious that none of her clothes would fit her anymore. While she looked around the room searching for something that could serve as clothing the strange plant on her nightstand caught her eyes. For some reason, it was glowing in a similar way that her whole body did. What’s more, Michelle was seeing that the glow was intensifying at its buds. Now it dawned on her. The strange glow she was seeing, was not visible by normal eyes, but was in fact the same energy that had also caused her transformation. She went over to the plant and after a closer look at its buds, she saw that they contained a liquid that glowed with the same strange energy. Then she saw the empty glass, still standing under the plant. Michelle put two and two together: she had drunk the liquid along with her vitamins and that had transformed her! That meant that she would be able to transform into a super powered goddess as often as she wanted as long this plant was alive and well.\nBut this didn’t solve the problem at hand: she still wanted to go out and try out her new super body. Then it hit her: why would Michelle ‘go’ out when she could fly? It was dark outside and nobody was watching the sky, so the fact that she was practically naked didn’t matter. Michelle took out a backpack and put some clothes in. Even if they wouldn’t fit her now, she wanted to make sure she had something to wear, in case her transformation ended before she returned home. She opened her window – thank goodness she was living in the third and uppermost floor – checked that nobody was outside and slowly flew out of the window and into the night sky.\nMichelle couldn’t believe how good it felt to fly in an open space. Faster and faster she rose into the air. Soon the half-naked woman arrived high over the city where no mortal eye would be able to spot her. Flying across an open space felt totally different than what she did back in her room. It was a totally new sense of freedom. It felt like she was meant to live in the sky instead of the ground, even though she spent all her life living under the iron fisted rule of gravity. She changed her direction towards a mountain range and accelerated her flight. Michelle wanted to test out her bodies capabilities and thought it would be best to fly at top speed. While accelerating, the feeling of her super energy intensified mirroring her increased usage of said energy. Suddenly one of the mountains that had been miles away from her starting point filled her entire view.\nFlying this fast, Michelle could neither stop nor dodge at this point. With a loud bang she crashed into the mountain. Michelle was surprised at the fact that the impact had barely hurt. She had been sure that she couldn’t possibly survive that crash, but after everything that had happened this night the idea of being invulnerable wasn’t too hard to swallow. Still she had expected that crashing into a mountain didn’t feel more painful than being showed against on the street. The young woman stood up and looked around; her crash had left a small crater. Luckily her backpack was still intact, though dirty. Her pajama pants on the other hand had been little more than rags after this crash. With a sigh Michelle ripped the remains of her pajama pants of her. “At least now I can see my new legs” she thought.\nSpotting a large boulder, Michelle thought this was the perfect chance to test whether she really had super strength or all she could do was making her muscles grow. Grabbing the boulder was a challenge itself. She bent over and tried to get her arms around it, but the boulder was too big for that. Since it lacked any edges for her to grab, she just pressed her hands onto the boulder and tried to lift it. At first it seemed as if the boulder wouldn’t budge at all, but then she felt the familiar feeling of energy building up inside her and after a few seconds, she was able to lift it. “Yes,” she said as she lifted the boulder over her head, “I am super strong”. Even though her body was pulsing with energy, her muscles had not grown this time like they had when she had flexed them in front of the mirror. Michelle activated her flight powers and rose into the air – still holding the boulder. The extra weight made it harder for her to lift off the ground, but her body took care of that by using even more of this super energy which pulsed now stronger than ever. Michelle suddenly remembered, that the amount of energy she had was limited.\nNot wanting to waste any more of her precious super energy, Michelle let go of the boulder and it landed with a loud thud on the ground. Still floating on the same spot, the new superwoman tried to categorize her energy consumption. Lifting the boulder had not used too much energy, but flying at the same time used at least 10 times more energy. As long as she didn’t move in midair, her body barely used more energy than it used automatically. Obviously the amount of power needed for flight varied with both speed and carried weight.\nLanding gracefully back on the floor, Michelle wondered what other powers she possessed. She had confirmed flight, super strength and invulnerability as well as super eyesight. “If I can fly at such a high speed, maybe I can run just as fast?” she thought. Michelle remembered some scenes from TV where super speed resulted in the person running like a blur. But those were caused by special effects, how would real super speed work? The naked woman brought herself into a sprinters starting position. She concentrated on activating her super strength in her long, slender legs before pushing with all the strength her right leg could muster. Instead of pushing herself forwards she felt how her foot dug into the ground that gave away to the force applied to it. Dirt and debris flew behind her as her naked foot cut through the ground with little resistance. With her footing lost, Michelle’s first step took her “only” fifty feet forward where the loss of balance caused her naked body to fall down and slide over the unsteady ground for another ten feet. The dirt-covered woman rose back to her feet, knowing that her invulnerability had prevented her from being seriously injured. Her next attempt was much better than this failed experiment. Instead of accelerating as fast as possible, the naked amazon started with a light stroll down the mountain, slowly increasing her speed. Soon she was running faster than 200 miles per hour and she still had no problems with her footing. Michelle considered trying to run at full speed, but chose otherwise, feeling that her energy supply was nearing its end.\n“Damn, it was just getting good” she thought. Looking back to where she had left her backpack, Michelle tried to test one more thing out. She bent her knees and tried to calculate the distance before she jumped of the ground. This time the young woman was prepared for the sensation of the ground giving away to the force she applied, before her body shot in the intended direction. At the peak of her jump, the young superwoman activated her flight powers directing her body towards her original landing spot where she picked up her backpack before flying back home. She didn’t fly at full speed since that would deplete her energy supply even faster With the velocity gained through her jump, Michelle had been able to build up speed and height with a lot less energy than flying alone would have used. She figured as long as the terrain allowed for her to use more force, this would be the most efficient way to travel. Her energy supply was big enough that she was able to fly all the way home and she still had some reserves when she entered her room. She was relieved to have some energy left, because thanks to her less-than-graceful landing in the mountains and her failed attempt at super speed, she was covered in dirt. Instead of leaving dirty footsteps on the floor, she hovered into the bathroom and took a shower.\nWhile she was showering, Michelle was reminded of how different her new body felt. She quickly realized that she was much more sensitive than before when she felt the water run down her body. She started to ponder the events of the night, from her transformation to the discovery of her super powers to her test run in the mountains. Something great had happened to her and she would need to make the best of it. Once she finished her shower, Michelle laid down on her bed, waiting for her transformation to end. In order to speed things up, she started to hover above her bed. She looked into her bedroom mirror once more, seeing her super body in all its naked glory. Damn she was hot. With this body, she could easily have any man she wanted. Michelle wondered how sex with super powers would be like. Would there even be a man that could satisfy her? But then again she was much more sensitive now, so that wouldn’t be a problem, right? Her super strength might be a whole other issue no man would be able to withstand that, should she lose control.\nWhat was she thinking? She had a plant that created super serum, so obviously she could turn the lucky man into a super stud that would clearly be worthy of her. She giggled, while starting to fantasize about the possibilities of having sex with an equally powerful partner. While her own flying powers alone gave several new opportunities for lovemaking, a partner that could do so as well would take the whole thing to another level – a level of their choice. The sheer thoughts of the possibilities aroused her and she absentmindedly started to massage her new breasts. The young woman was so aroused, that she wasn’t even surprised by how pleasant the sensations from her breasts were. If she was able to think straight at this point, she would have realized that she was already feeling better than during any orgasm she had ever experienced. With her pleasure building up, she slid one hand down to her wet pussy and began stroking it. Her fantasies about a male partner were washed away by the sheer amount of pleasure she was experiencing and it grew stronger at an even faster rate now. Michelle was totally incapable of a rational thought right now. She started to breathe harder. If any man – no any PERSON – entered her room and caught her attention the young goddess would have fucked that person literally into oblivion. Ironically, Michelle only emitted rather faint moaning noises so none of her neighbors were aware of her super masturbation. She squeezed her breasts with more and more strength while also fingering herself at increasing speed. As her pleasure was about to reach its peak, Michelle slowly rose even further from her bed. Then with a force Michelle couldn’t even begin to describe, she came. She opened her eyes wide and only saw stars, while the biggest orgasm in the history of humanity washed over her. The young woman couldn’t scream in pleasure, somehow her voice refused to work right now. Now grabbing her pussy with both hands, she was trying to make this moment of absolute joy last forever. For several minutes she succeeded, but eventually she came down from her height – in more ways than one, as she slowly drifted down to land gently in her bed. Her vision returned to normal, the ceiling replacing the stars she had seen.\nFor the first time since her transformation started, Michelle felt exhausted. She could barely feel any of the super energy in her body. Still, she was surprised that it had lasted this long, especially since her little excitement just now would have been a huge strain on her super supply. As the last bit of energy dissipated, Michelle stood up to watch her mirror image as her transformation reversed itself. Her body got shorter, her fitness model size muscles retreated inward and her breast shrunk back to their original size. Her hair shortened as well and lost its blonde color. The enhancements on her face disappeared as well as did her improved eyesight. In a matter of seconds, she had reverted to how she was before her transformation, a goddess replaced by a near-sighted mortal. Michelle looked at her blurry mirror image with a disappointed frown; secretly she had hoped that only her powers would disappear and that she would keep her gorgeous appearance.\nA smile came over her face as she realized that this was a good thing. With the ability of turning from plain Michelle to a super sexy goddess and back again, she could lead a double life. All she needed to do was take good care of this mysterious plant and she could basically do anything she wanted. When Michelle stepped away from her mirror, something tickled her foot. She looked down to see that she had stepped onto the remains of her original hair that had fallen out during her transformation. “Wait a second” she thought, rushing to her nightstand to recover her glasses and returned to take a good look at herself in the mirror. She picked up a strand of hair and compared it to the hair still on her head. There was no doubt about it; her hair was different than before. While her original hair had been mousy and plain, her new hair even though still brown was full and lustrous. Speaking of hair, Michelle realized that she still had no hair on any other part of her body besides her head, maybe that change was permanent? And now that she watched her body with her glasses on, she could make out another difference: While she was never fat, she used to have a few extra pounds that now were nowhere to be found. The only body fat she found were her breasts which looked bigger now, but Michelle was sure that this was because her frame had become slimmer. Even though her super self was still way more attractive, she had to admit that she liked the new mortal her. As she suddenly yawned, Michelle was reminded at how sleepy she had been and turned to finally go to bed. Tomorrow was going to be a long day since she had some shopping to do – for both her selves. And of course she had to take her super body for another test ride…\n","permalink":"blog/prispevky/michelle-meteor-memento-part01/","tags":["povídky","supersíla","transformace","létání"],"title":"Michelle's Meteor Memento Part 01"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Zde chci nabídnout zajímavé odkazy, které by čtenáře tohoto blogu mohly zajímat.
