            <p>The story picks up from where we last left off. Mac and Joy are unconscious, near death; the rescue team arrives in Davao searching for the Thompson&rsquo;s mother; Trevor&rsquo;s pod delivers the doomsday device and rescues some crash survivors; and another slice of paradise is revealed.</p>
<p>Jackson &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Baker was an odd duck, and he knew it. One of the great perks of being rich was that it rarely mattered what anyone one else thought of you, so Jack indulged himself in all the characteristics that made him odd. He stretched his Ichabod-Crane-like-body upward, his long bony fingers reaching for the low, steel gray clouds that scurried across the winter sky. He admired, for a brief moment, the complex pattern the clouds formed as they jostled past one another above the dark waters of the Chesapeake Bay, but then lowered his eyes to the boat that was approaching from the north, bouncing across the choppy water. Sitting down on the pilings at the end of the long dock, he watched the small craft surging towards him.</p>
<p>Annette Dawson had called earlier that morning. Her husband Brent and two friends were going to arrive and it was a &ldquo;company emergency,&rdquo; which he understood to require absolute secrecy. Annette had been one of the few people in his life with whom he actually felt comfortable talking, despite her beauty. One other person was his boyhood friend, Kyle Johnson. Annette was much prettier. From their very first meeting in college, Annette had somehow put him at ease, and they had remained friends ever since. She was an incredibly bright undergraduate with sparkling green eyes, a thick head of blond hair, and a piercing intellect. He was a reclusive doctoral student in computer programming, but she had found him intriguing and became one of Jack&rsquo;s few friends. They started working together professionally only six years ago, when she brought him in on a case as a consultant. Jack smiled as he remembered how impressed her superiors were with his speed and efficiency in programming the complex web-bots that identified, tracked, and logged terrorist cell phone calls.</p>
<p>He could see Annette&rsquo;s blond hair whipping in the wind as the small boat approached. He frowned as he noticed that the boat was not The Slipper, which was Kyle Johnson&rsquo;s deadrise work-boat that normally ferried passengers and supplies to his remote island. The Johnson&rsquo;s had been friends with the Bakers for several generations, and Kyle was nearly the same age as Jack. Like Jack, Kyle was something of a loner, and the two men found an easy tolerance in the other, mostly born of their long association and partly because both men did not like talking. No, Annette and her crew were arriving in a speedboat, not Kyle&rsquo;s sturdy working boat, but the speedboat looked as if it were equally as old as The Slipper, and a lot worse for the wear.</p>
<p>Jack thought back on his various associations with Annette. They had always enjoyed an easy friendship, no awkwardness after long absences, but Jack recognized that neither he nor Annette had ever sparked anything more than a friendship between them. There was no sexual tension. Nothing. Which was odd because Annette was beautiful. Jack knew that while he wasn&rsquo;t, himself, repulsive, he was never going to be confused for a heartthrob. He hadn&rsquo;t dated very may women in his relatively long life, and he didn&rsquo;t know if he ever would. He didn&rsquo;t want to die alone, but he had reconciled himself to the possibility. He watched as the boat drew nearer and shook his head to clear these old and well-worn issues from his mind. As the clouds of doubt finally cleared from his mind, the lurching boat drew up to the dock where he sat waiting.</p>
<p>Brent Dawson eased the bobbing craft alongside the ramshackle dock while Annette threw the painter to Jack, who nimbly secured the line to one of the dock cleats at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jack,&rdquo; Annette said, as she reached up to his extended hand. &ldquo;You have no idea how much this means to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack nodded, his long face impassive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t call Johnson&rsquo;s Marine because we needed absolute secrecy,&rdquo; she explained, sensing his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kyle understands company business,&rdquo; Jack said, as he caught the stern line and secured that to another cleat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d trust him with my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have to,&rdquo; Annette said with a wan smile. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t exactly company business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about it after we get these two inside,&rdquo; Brent suggested impatiently, waving his hands over two figures covered in blankets. &ldquo;Can you give me a hand?&rdquo; he asked with a nod to Jack.</p>
<p>Jack nodded back and stepped down into the rocking boat, easily navigating the somewhat tamer gyrations of the boat as it lurched against the ropes holding it in place against the dark, winter waves. Brent stooped to pick up the larger of the two figures, and Jack again marveled at the retired Navy man&rsquo;s strength and agility. Brent heaved what looked like a young man up from the fore section of the speedboat up onto the dock, where Annette steadied the shivering body. Jack was glad that he was still in decent shape himself as he reached down to pick up what looked like a young woman who was shivering, apparently delirious, wrapped in a wool blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here,&rdquo; Annette indicated a space next to the body Brent had deposited on cold, worn, wooden dock planks.</p>
<p>As Jack eased the shaking, female body onto the dock, Brent made his way aft and picked up several olive drab duffel bags. He gathered them up and joined Jack in the front of the boat. He handed the bags to Annette, who strung one over each shoulder and headed up the dock towards the house that brooded over the rocky island from its center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You follow Annette up to the house with Joy,&rdquo; Brent ordered, indicating the obviously female body Jack had just placed on the deck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something to do here, and then I&rsquo;ll join you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make sure it&rsquo;s to the southwest,&rdquo; Jack said as he picked up the still unconscious woman. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a deep spot in the channel about a mile out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were always a smart one,&rdquo; Brent said, with a stiff smile. &ldquo;With this weather that&rsquo;s about three minutes at 20 knots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;bout that,&rdquo; Jack agreed.</p>
<p>He watched Brent attach a small device to the bottom of the boat near the gas tank, and then lash the steering wheel and throttle to fixed positions. Brent released the bowline, pushing the boat into a southerly direction. He started the engine and hopped quickly up onto the deck, holding a second aft line in his hands. As the boat strained against the mooring lines, Brent tied both lines to a single cleat and then shortened one until he was satisfied, lining up the prow of the boat against the horizon. He checked his watch for a few seconds, and pulled a pocketknife from his pocket. He knelt down and watched the seconds go by, and then cleanly sliced through both lines, freeing the boat. He refolded the knife, gathered the severed ends of the rope still attached to the cleats, and turned to pick up the young man, still shivering on the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t contagious, at least not in any conventional way,&rdquo; Brent said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will make for a good story,&rdquo; Jack said simply, turning with his burden and heading up the dock towards the house where Annette had already made her way inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no idea,&rdquo; muttered Brent to himself lifting Mac into a firefighter&rsquo;s carry and following the tall, thin man up the dock towards the ancient house looming over the grassy island. A few moments later, as they neared the house there was a short, loud thump that echoed sharply across the bay, followed by the soft, strangled sound of an outboard engine choking as it was overwhelmed by water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re staying for the night,&rdquo; Brent joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yup,&rdquo; Jackson observed, kicking the door open as he maneuvered Joy into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is all this really necessary?&rdquo; Jaclyn whined as she lay next to her new sister-wife, Janice, both of their bodies covered in a thicket of wires and sensors. &ldquo;I feel like the frog in a high school biology class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost done,&rdquo; Pat assured the newly minted mermaid. &ldquo;The data on your transition are the richest yet, and we need to try to figure out what factors affect our transformations. Your data might be able to help Mac and Joy or the rescue team up in Davao, so just relax, and it will all be over in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The table is really uncomfortable,&rdquo; Jaclyn continued. &ldquo;My dorsal fin itches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Alexis reported from behind a cluster of computer screens, only her pink tail visible as it thumped impatiently on the polished floor of the cave. &ldquo;Will someone please scratch her port side, about ten centimeters up from the base of her fin? My readings are getting corrupted by all that surface muscle twitching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brian left Julie&rsquo;s side where he had been watching the mer scientists poke, prod, and measure two of his sister-wives and salamandered over to the table where the two beautiful, but very different mermaids lay next to one another. He carefully slid one hand under Jaclyn&rsquo;s shapely waist until he found her dorsal ridge, then approximating ten centimeters with his fingers; he gently scratched her soft fin where it bent against the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aaaaaahhhhhhh,&rdquo; Jaclyn sighed, her body relaxing as her mate&rsquo;s fingers brought instant relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always liked getting your back scratched more than anything else,&rdquo; Janice teased. &ldquo;Even a blowjob doesn&rsquo;t compare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still do,&rdquo; Jaclyn said with a wicked smile. &ldquo;Now, however, I give blow jobs, not get them. Right Brian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a promise?&rdquo; Brian joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, trust me,&rdquo; Jaclyn said, smiling, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to wait for another transition for an excuse to suck on your lovely cock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much longer on this testing?&rdquo; Brian shot over to Pat, clearly agitated by Jaclyn&rsquo;s teasing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, Tiger,&rdquo; Pat admonished. &ldquo;You guys will get us all going again, and then we&rsquo;ll have to start the data collection all over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brian, get back here,&rdquo; Julie ordered. &ldquo;I want all four of us back in the water, and I don&rsquo;t want to wait for Ms. Frankenstein to restart everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Dr. Ms. Frankenstein to you,&rdquo; Pat joked.</p>
<p>Brian returned to Julie&rsquo;s side, letting his steel-gray and green flukes droop into the pool. Draping his arm around Julie&rsquo;s waist, he watched as the mer scientists worked. Several moments of relative silence passed as Pat, Phoebe, Alexis, and Galina hunched over data screens and sensor arrays, while Jaclyn and Janice lay patiently on the table closest to the pool.</p>
<p>Brian sensed a tingle running up his tail, and he recognized the stirring of his CHEW. His mer-senses were still new to him, and carefully he had to sort out John and Danni&rsquo;s strong signals from their children&rsquo;s signals. Closing his eyes to concentrate, he then identified Eric, Sally, Liga and little Mari&rsquo;s signals. The tingling intensified as a new set of signals emerged from the long passageway connecting the Lab Pool to the Moon Pool. A few seconds later, he identified the signals of Gabriel, Petra, Xing, and Michelle as they swam towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pod approaches, Galina,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can wait a few minutes,&rdquo; she answered in her slight Russian accent. &ldquo;We are almost done here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten more minutes until we&rsquo;re supposed to contact the rescue team,&rdquo; Eric reported as he surfaced with the rest of his pod, searching for Alexis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know,&rdquo; both Pat and Alexis answering in unison, neither lifting their heads from the screens flashing data in complex rows and columns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phoebe?&rdquo; Pat asked, knowing her pod mate knew the rest of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two minutes, nineteen seconds,&rdquo; Phoebe reported from deep within the cave where she monitored the array of computers they had cobbled together into a mock supercomputer. &ldquo;The data is clean, and all systems are green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have seen what they did to me when they discovered I could see CHEW,&rdquo; Eric said as he pushed himself out of the water and flopped next to Brian, Sally landing next to him a half second later. &ldquo;The taste of that metallic paste stayed in my mouth for three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; protested Jaclyn. &ldquo;Not what I was looking forward to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get over it,&rdquo; Eric joked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not nearly as interesting as the anal probe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you keep distracting us, you&rsquo;ll get reacquainted intimately with that probe,&rdquo; Galina said with a scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; Eric said, thumping Brian on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thank you,&rdquo; Brian said with a grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t knock it until you&rsquo;ve tried it,&rdquo; Janice said, winking at her mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do we still call it an anus even though it&rsquo;s been moved over to the front?&rdquo; asked Jaclyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet,&rdquo; hushed Galina, her scowl fighting for space on her face with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Eric advised in a whisper. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t piss off the Russian,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a good idea,&rdquo; Gabriel agreed in hushed tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s worth it,&rdquo; Petra said gently, her head bobbing above the water of the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said hush!&rdquo; Galina repeated, but the smile won the battle as she lifted an eyebrow at her pod-mates.</p>
<p>Malaki frowned at his computer screen, wondering&ndash;again&ndash;why two of his three sons had disappeared, along with a valuable (and beautiful) executive assistant, why one of his most reliable and ruthless operatives had disappeared along with his entire gang, and more importantly, why it felt like the edges of his carefully built empire were beginning to crumble.</p>
<p>For the last few months, many of his officers seemed to be acting with greater and greater independence. The disappearance of his sons, with little or no explanation from him, was probably the biggest reason why. Now he was getting reports that several of his most senior people were thinking of going independent. He had to act soon, and he needed to find his sons or produce their bodies as examples for what happens to even his own family members who are foolish enough to attempt an &ldquo;independent&rdquo; operation.</p>
<p>One of his Davao operators reported seeing Manalo and Abao together and suspected that they were plotting to overthrow their father. According to the reports, his sons had been dividing their time between Davao and several other remote islands, some of which were unknown to anyone. Malaki suspected that they spent most of their time at the old hide-away island that the equally absent Alberto had used occasionally. At first, the entire problem appeared to be Alberto going rogue, but now it seemed there was a deeper conspiracy within his organization, and that two of his own sons were leading it.</p>
<p>At first, Malaki refused to believe it. But he confirmed the rumors with his newest mole, Conjo. There was nothing like revenge to motivate a spy, Malaki thought. Conjo was not entirely trustworthy, and so Malaki decided that he would personally travel to Davao, find his sons, capture them, and then properly punish them for their disloyalty. He had hoped to hand off his business to his eldest son, but he was unwilling to let it be taken. The betrayal he felt gnawed at him, sending a tight knot of pain in his chest. He slumped before his computer, feeling the weight of his loss. Only his youngest, and least tested son, Torro, was left to him. Well, it was time to test his youngest son&rsquo;s loyalty and leadership.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sudhish,&rdquo; he barked into the speakerphone on his desk as he straightened up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the voice crackled in return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make travel plans for Davao for the executive team, and get Torro in here immediately,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the electronically transmitted voice replied again.</p>
<p>Malaki frowned at the phone, considering what to do about his current executive assistant. His last one had disappeared with his eldest son, and while he hoped that they might be holding Shen against her will, he knew that the death of her sister had freed her to act independently. His sources had confirmed that the girl had been killed trying to escape, but those reports were deeply suspect.</p>
<p>No one had escaped from the Davao brothels in years, and he suspected that Manalo ordered the death of Shen&rsquo;s sister, blamed it on his father, and then manipulated the girl in to serving him in revenge. That insult would add another day of pain for his son, provided he could put his hands on the bastard. Sudhish was modestly trust worthy as long as Malaki held his sisters in captivity. However, if his older sons were plotting to take over the operations at Davao, where he had recently transferred Sudhish&rsquo;s sisters, then his hold over Sudhish was at risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sudhish,&rdquo; he said, as he punched the speakerphone button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo; his assistant answered from the other room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make plans to accompany the executive team to Davao,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>A visual reminder of the danger into which Malaki could put Sudhish&rsquo;s family would be a useful reinforcement, Malaki decided. He could move the girls from the standard duties of prostitute to the more exotic duties of snuff film actress. Fear and revenge were useful tools, and Malaki had built an empire with those simple tools. It was time to return to basics, he concluded. Fear and revenge.</p>
<p>The six mermaid children swam in playful circles among and around the otherwise motionless twenty-four adult mers who had arranged themselves into their triangular formation for long-distance CHEW connections. Their playful squeals didn&rsquo;t distract any of the adults, especially since toddler mermaids could not generate &ldquo;directed&rdquo; CHEW themselves. The sea was relatively still and calm off Mermaid Island, the bright sun glinting and sparkling off the gentle swells of the ocean. The tiny mermaids chased the flickering beams of light as they bounced around the otherwise still adult mers, being careful not to move too far away from their parents.</p>
<p>Just beyond where the tiny mermaids frolicked, the sea floor fell away sharply a few meters in front of the lead mermaid, Pat. She floated at the front of the formation, concentrating on communicating with a mermaid thousands of kilometers distant. Her eyes were closed, and her long auburn hair floating around her pale, beautiful face like a fire-lace curtain that curling about her graceful neck, falling along her gently sloping shoulders, her lush breasts, and down past her slender waist. Her long, powerful tail, with its sparkling green scales that covered her wide hips, hung motionless beneath her, the pink fringes along her flukes and fins fluttering in the still water only when one of the children swirled past her. Her brow was furrowed in concentration as she communicated over a mind-boggling distance.</p>
<p>She was a vision of beauty, but no other mer was currently contemplating her beauty. Everyone was arranged behind her with their eyes closed too, all concentrating on their CHEW, helping to amplify Pat&rsquo;s own signal. All the pods made for a colorful array that might have reminded a distant observer of a magnificent aquarium full of tropical fish floating over a sandy basin just beyond a dark coral reef, except they were in a perfect formation and otherwise unmoving. No normal fish behaved like that! Nor were the large fish and marine mammals of the ocean that colorful; not until recently, of course.</p>
<p>Unknown to the beautifully, if unnaturally, arranged mermaids and mermen, a distant observer did pass overhead, so far overhead as to be invisible to the mers below, even if they had been looking upwards. Nevertheless, the silently orbiting satellite recorded yet another image of brightly colored aquatic animals arranged in a formation of inexplicable behavior in fish or sea mammals.</p>
<p>The surveillance system flagged and then shunted the picture into a Blackgate protocol folder, hiding it from nearly anyone who might casually stumble across it. That folder was growing slowly, and while the two creators of that folder were themselves now among those unbelievably colorful marine animals in that picture, the folder was nearing its maximum size before the protocol creating it needed reviewing and renewal. Someone, soon, was going to have to look at that folder.</p>
<p>Both Eric and Sally held their places within the formation near Liga and Alexis, all four of them ignoring the happy squealing of Mari, Liga&rsquo;s child. Alexis still wasn&rsquo;t showing, but she was pregnant with Agba&rsquo;s child. As the former Russian scientist focused her efforts on boosting Pat&rsquo;s CHEW, she could feel her womb throb as the mermaid within continued to develop, a faint glimmer of CHEW emanating from the fetus. Alexis refocused her attention from within to the conversation she was facilitating.</p>
<p>[Yes,] Pat said, answering Trixi&rsquo;s question. [We hope that Joy and Mac will make their transition safely. We have no way of reaching them now. Have you made contact yet with Michael Thompson?]</p>
<p>[No,] answered Trixi. [We have made good use of the time, however, by performing a lot of reconnaissance. When did they say they would arrive?]</p>
<p>[Two, perhaps three more days,] Pat answered. [Once you make your plans, please let us know what they will entail.]</p>
<p>[Will do,] Trixi said. [Chat in 24 then?]</p>
<p>[24.] Pat answered.</p>
<p>[Rodger dodger, over and out.] Trixi said.</p>
<p>The formation of mers stayed still for a few beats more, and when Pat turned away from the west, everyone broke off into their individual pods to begin their day. James&rsquo; pod, being some of the newest members of the mer family, could hardly contain their excitement as they raced each other from point to point. Pat rubbed her forehead lightly as she watched Bridget and Elise rocket towards the surface performing some aerial maneuver.</p>
<p>[You O.K.?] Danni asked as she drew her long body next to her sisterwife' s.</p>
<p>[Yea,] Pat answered. [This actually gets easier with practice. Is Phoebe supervising food for the brood?]</p>
<p>[For a change,] Danni said as she wound her tail around Pat&rsquo;s. [John&rsquo;s helping.]</p>
<p>[What&rsquo;s gotten into you?] Pat asked as she felt Danni&rsquo;s graceful fingers play along the edges of her gills, causing tremors to race along her body.</p>
<p>[John&rsquo;s orders, actually.] Danni said as she pulled Pat into an embrace, kissing her deeply.</p>
<p>[What orders are those?] Pat asked, her chest rising and falling with increasing passion as her sister-wife expertly played her body like a musical instrument.</p>
<p>[A little mermaid milk to rejuvenate the hard-working scientist, who stays up half the night crunching data and then does a little long distance CHEW in the morning,] Danni answered as she pushed Pat&rsquo;s face towards her own breasts.</p>
<p>[You guys are wonderful,] Pat said kissing the sides of Danni&rsquo;s impressive breasts, working her way towards the long stiff nipple that now oozed milk into the water. [But this is just medicinal, right?] Pat teased as she lightly nipped Danni&rsquo;s long nipple, causing the blond mermaid to twitch and moan in pleasure. A small squirt of mermaid milk shot into Pat&rsquo;s mouth, the warm sweetness mixing with the cool saltiness of the ocean.</p>
<p>[Uuuuuuh, yessssssss,] moaned Danni as she caressed Pat&rsquo;s auburn hair to encourage her sister-wife to feed. [Nothing else, ooooh, at all. Just medicinal.]</p>
<p>[Fine, then.] Pat said as she pulled Danni&rsquo;s teat into her mouth and sucked hard. She felt Danni arch into the feeding, her body quivering with passion. Pat could feel her body responding quickly to the lifegiving, healing effects of the mermaid milk that was now gushing down her throat. She could also feel her flukes beginning to quiver as her own passion rose from within.</p>
<p>An hour later, Phoebe asked Danni to switch with her, and Pat happily embraced Phoebe as Danni swam back to John watching his three daughters continue to frolic unaffected by the shared passion of their mermaid mothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, is some sort of parasite in these two that is changing them into mermaids?&rdquo; Jack said, waving his hands towards the two swaddled figures still shivering on the floor of his family&rsquo;s island home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, only Joy will be a mermaid,&rdquo; Annette corrected. &ldquo;Mac will be a merman, technically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call themselves mers,&rdquo; added Brent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mers,&rdquo; Jackson repeated, savoring the word. &ldquo;And they need to be in sea water in order to complete their change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think so,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;Pat and the other mers are going to give me more a conclusive answer after the most recent batch of transformees had finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that will be &hellip;&rdquo; Jackson asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon?&rdquo; Annette answered. &ldquo;It may have already happened. The last few days have been pretty hectic with these two.&rdquo; She waved her hand over the two unconscious people on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to raise the mermaids on the short wave early tomorrow morning, which should be their afternoon,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no sense in waiting any longer, is there?&rdquo; Jackson asked as he stood up. &ldquo;Getting them into my primary tank won&rsquo;t do them any harm, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Annette agreed. &ldquo;As long as we keep their heads out of the water until we&rsquo;re sure their gills are working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gills?&rdquo; Jackson asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see once we get them into the water,&rdquo; Annette answered, nodding to her husband Brent, who rose to gather up the bundle cocooning Mac Bennett.</p>
<p>Jackson bent his long frame over the swaddled Joy Simpson and hoisted her into his arms. &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; he said as he headed for the basement stairwell.</p>
<p>Annette picked up one of the small, duffel bags and opened the door at Jackson&rsquo;s invitation, watching the two men descend with their burdens. As she followed them down the stairs, she glanced around the otherwise unremarkable basement of an Eastern Shore island home. Jackson used Joy&rsquo;s feet to move an otherwise normal looking pipe a few inches into the stone blocks of the foundation, and then stepped back as a section of the wall silently slid back to reveal another passageway angling down and away from the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my father accidentally burnt down the chicken barn twenty years ago, I used that opportunity to build this facility,&rdquo; Jackson explained. &ldquo;The rebuilt chicken barn is a fake and it doesn&rsquo;t have any working doors above ground, and the only access is through here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made their way down the wide passageway until they emerged into a large underground room, having a thick, glass partition stretching across the room. The fake barn was visible above the three-meter high glass wall as it bisected the room. There was a winch with a chain at the apex of the rafters, and light filtered down through the seemingly transparent roof. The enormous aquarium stretched an additional five meters below the ground where they stood and at least ten meters back from the glass wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My god,&rdquo; gasped Brent. &ldquo;How big is this tank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly one million gallons,&rdquo; Jackson reported. &ldquo;And it is slightly more saline than the estuary water surrounding the island. There is direct outside access to the bay through a tunnel that connects to this tank, but you have to operate two different sets of locks and gates to swim through.&rdquo; He gently laid Joy onto the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We harvest energy from the tidal flows to power the systems keeping the water in the tank fresh, filtered, and aerated, but we have emergency pumps if something should happen with the passive system,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this tank could function in the absence of outside power?&rdquo; Brent asked, impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This tank DOES function in the absence of any outside power,&rdquo; Jack said with pride. &ldquo;The electrical pumps are backups in case we have to radically clean the tank, if an invasive species or algae bloom were to appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jackson collects marine life as a life-long hobby and has a particular affinity for cuttle fish,&rdquo; Annette added as she began to sort through the duffel bag. &ldquo;You can see some of them over there,&rdquo; she finished, pointing through the thicket of other fish swimming in slow lazy circles near the front of the tank. There, towards the back of the tank, Brent could barely make out a few cuttle fish darted among the rocks and reefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These two aren&rsquo;t going to become an invasive species?&rdquo; asked Jackson as he gently laid Joy onto the floor in front of the glass wall. &ldquo;I mean the parasites that are in their bodies won&rsquo;t harm my animals, will they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mers live in complete harmony with all kinds of marine life in their caves,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if cuttlefish share any of their spaces, but I know that fish who have been otherwise sick or injured have recovered after being exposed to the mers' unique parasites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same parasites in mers also healed fish species?&rdquo; asked Jackson, stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;Again, Joy told me as much, but I&rsquo;ve only talked to rest of the mers twice over short wave, just before these two became delirious and then unconscious. Here, take one,&rdquo; she added as she handed Jackson a small plastic bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a float that will keep their faces open to the air,&rdquo; Annette explained, opening hers and unfolding the small plastic device.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the parasites are beneficial, then why do these two look so sick?&rdquo; Jackson asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parasites live only part of their life cycle in mer bodies; they don&rsquo;t live in them permanently,&rdquo; Annette explained. &ldquo;The microorganisms spend most of their life cycle outside a mer body, so that&rsquo;s why they look sick. The mers identified over 50 different types of microorganisms all sharing a viral packet that carries inert Mer DNA. Inside a human body they become Siren Cells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sirens of the Sea,&rdquo; Jack said, smiling. &ldquo;So, these two have been infected by a viral change agent. Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of becoming infected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I plan on becoming infected,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;However, according to my brief conversations with Pat, the mer scientists believe that the parasites are not topically viable, and that only immersion into an environment in which they live can actually allow the infection to occur. They can survive inside our bodies, particularly the GI tract, our reproductive fluids, and our lymph nodes, but not on our skin. They only appear on our skin for part of their life cycle. They cannot survive in air. We think these two were infected when they swam through the Moon Pool, which is the central chamber in the mer community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still doesn&rsquo;t explain why these two look like they&rsquo;re dying,&rdquo; Jackson persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at the edge of my knowledge here,&rdquo; Annette explained. &ldquo;I think the parasites require the salts and minerals that are naturally dissolved in sea-water to function properly, and so they are harvesting those salts and minerals from within Joy and Mac&rsquo;s bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t they changed,&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have changed,&rdquo; Brent said. &ldquo;Both of these two are, or were, our age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got younger?&rdquo; Jack said, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, now they both look twenty-five,&rdquo; said Annette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very pale, sunken, and sallow twenty-five,&rdquo; offered Brent, unwrapping Mac from his woolen cocoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve also started developing proto-mer features,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;Here, look at this,&rdquo; she said as she unwrapped Joy a little bit, and pulled an arm free from the swaddling. Joy&rsquo;s arm twitched every few seconds, sometimes from the wrist, sometimes from the elbow, sometimes just a few fingers. In fact her whole body was twitching and jerking about, just little twitches, but noticeable nevertheless. Jackson peered closely at Joy&rsquo;s hand as Annette held it forward. There he could see webbing up to her first knuckle in between each finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t kidding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know how much they&rsquo;ve changed internally either, but mers have several organs that humans don&rsquo;t, and these new organs do everything from generating electricity, real electricity, to allowing them to see parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that we cannot,&rdquo; Annette explained as she finished unwrapping Joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Jack repeated. &ldquo;Those parasites pack a wallop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No kidding,&rdquo; Brent said, surveying the two, twitching and shivering humans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re quite sure these parasites won&rsquo;t hurt my animals?&rdquo; asked Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty sure. Most of these fish look very much like the ones we know live in in the same reefs and caves as the mers,&rdquo; Annette answered, waving her hand towards the hundreds of fish swimming in the large tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you weren&rsquo;t sure about the cuttle fish?&rdquo; Jackson persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if they were in any danger, there&rsquo;s only one or two in this tank,&rdquo; Brent said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo; Jackson asked, turning to Brent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only see two, back there, see,&rdquo; Brent answered, pointing to where he could see the medium sized creatures moving among rocks and sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are seventeen cuttlefish in this tank,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;They can camouflage themselves like few other creatures on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; Brent asked, searching the tank more carefully. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they predators? Wouldn&rsquo;t most of these fish be dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jackson, warming to one of his favorite subjects. &ldquo;But nearly all animal species in the ocean classify as predators, and yes, most of the fish you see here are supposed to be a dinner for the cuttlefish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t pose a danger to Joy and Mac, will they?&rdquo; Brent asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cuttlefish rarely attack anything bigger than themselves,&rdquo; Jackson reassured. &ldquo;They rely on stealth and surprise, not power or speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they have venom?&rdquo; Brent asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;But they are more likely to use it on one another than on humans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the expert,&rdquo; Brent said, eyeing the few cuttlefish he could actually see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of only a few private citizens able to keep and cultivate cuttlefish in an aquarium,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;They are hard to keep and breed in captivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Brent said, impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hobby,&rdquo; Jackson said dismissively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jackson,&rdquo; Annette began. She paused, and put a hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;Jackson, both Brent and I plan to join them as mers. I can&rsquo;t promise you that your pets will be unharmed, but I&rsquo;m going to subject myself to this process as soon as I can. I promise you I will make whatever reparations you think necessary if something happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that include allowing me to join you as well?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! I win five bucks,&rdquo; Annette said, turning to her husband. Brent fished around in his pants for his wallet and gave her the money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you bet?&rdquo; Jackson asked, smiling at his old friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brent still has some difficulties with the whole becoming-anotherspecies -thing,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d want to become a mer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know me as well as you do,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;But we have lots to talk about what &lsquo;joining&rsquo; the mers actually means before I&rsquo;ll let you make that decision. Just to start things off, the mers are organized in pods of three mermaids to one merman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would mean that &hellip; that &hellip; &quot; Jackson said, glancing at Brent and back to the body at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Brent said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to become the third mermaid. It&rsquo;s a long story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to hear it,&rdquo; Jackson said with a nod. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we get these two in the water before the parasites and siren cells kill them before they get the chance to change them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get them both undressed and set the floats,&rdquo; Annette said as she moved over to Joy&rsquo;s still twitching form. &ldquo;Then we can winch them into the tank,&rdquo; she finished, looking at the sling hanging on the far wall.</p>
<p>A diamond shaped formation of four mers swam in unison about five meters below the ocean surface. The undulations of their bodies were not as graceful or fluid as mers were normally, but then again, mers did not usually swim while harnessed to an ungainly looking contraption that might end all life on the planet. The relatively large, cage-like device, which they decided to call The Device, lay suspended beneath them as they swam slowly but steadily. Each mer, three mermaids and one merman, wore a utility belt that fitted snugly around the mers' hips, just above their pelvic fins.</p>
<p>Attached to each utility belt was a nylon rope, and all four ropes connected to a steel ring anchored in the center. From these four ropes The Device hung suspended in the middle of the mers about two meters below them. Anchored within the steel structural cage were several air bladders, almost giving The Device neutral buoyancy, thus towing the contraption wasn&rsquo;t as impossible as it might otherwise have been.</p>
<p>[How much further?] Ann asked from her starboard position in the formation.</p>
<p>[Nearly there,] Trevor answered from his lead position in front.</p>
<p>[Thank goodness,] Kate sighed. [You doing o.k. back there?]</p>
<p>[I&rsquo;m good,] Rose answered, bringing up the rear of the formation.</p>
<p>The mers swam for another hour before Trevor pulled them up and stopped. They each oriented vertically, keeping their flukes and fins moving to maintain their current depth. Trevor reached into a pocket along the side of his utility belt and removed a small device, oriented the device along cardinal points and pushed a button on its side. One of the four, intercardinal red LEDs blinked twice, then the center, green LED blinked once.</p>
<p>[Only another 1000 meters to the northeast,] Trevor said, returning the digital GPS to his utility belt.</p>
<p>[Wow, that was pretty good dead reckoning,] Rose said. [I don&rsquo;t think that even Emma could get that close without help.]</p>
<p>[Lucky,] Trevor said simply. [Even a blind squirrel gets a nut every once in a while.]</p>
<p>[We&rsquo;re going to have to come up with mer-versions of those sorts of sayings,] Ann said. [There are no sea squirrels.]</p>
<p>[Crabs sort of act like squirrels, always scampering about, taking stuff back into their nest,] Kate said.</p>
<p>[Can we return to our task?] Rose said. [I don&rsquo;t really want to be yoked to this damn thing longer than I have to be.]</p>
<p>[Sorry,] Kate said. [We&rsquo;ll swim.]</p>
<p>[It&rsquo;s fine, my love,] Rose said back. [This is just a big responsibility.]</p>
<p>The mers turned together, reoriented horizontally, and continued to swim in perfect unison for another 1000 meters. Trevor stopped them and checked his GPS device again. This time the green LED blinked once.</p>
<p>[Everyone ready for the descent?] he asked. Everyone responded affirmatively.</p>
<p>Trevor released the air from two of the air bladders, and the pod angled toward the bottom of the ocean, swimming slowly into the darkness. They headed for the middle of a large abyssal plain in which an extinct volcano reached up from a depth of 5000 meters to a peak of only 500 meters below sea level. As they descended into the inky blackness, their mer senses took over. They began &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; millions of tiny life forms as well as thousands of fish and other sea creatures occupying the depths. Some of these creatures even generated their own bioluminescence, making the darkness seem less oppressive.</p>
<p>Each of the mers could feel their bodies respond to the increase in pressure as their mer-organs kicked into overdrive, shielding them from the otherwise deadly pressure.</p>
<p>[It&rsquo;s so quiet down here,] Kate said with reverence.</p>
<p>[I can&rsquo;t believe our bodies can withstand this pressure,] Ann said. [I mean, I can feel it, but it isn&rsquo;t hurting me.]</p>
<p>[This isn&rsquo;t very deep, as far as the ocean goes,] Rose reminded them. [And we can go much deeper if we have to. Just keep it slow and steady, and we&rsquo;ll be fine.]</p>
<p>[Let&rsquo;s conserve our energies, shall we?] Trevor said. [We have a lot to do once we get there.]</p>
<p>He received non-verbal assent from each of his pod-mates and they continued downward in silence. After another ten minutes of swimming, they reached the top of the extinct volcano. It had the classic cone shaped top with a small crater-shaped bowl. Then they descended into its center.</p>
<p>[It&rsquo;s so empty,] Rose remarked, looking around.</p>
<p>[It won&rsquo;t be empty for long,] Trevor said.</p>
<p>They let The Device settle onto the sea floor and unhooked themselves from it. They coiled the ropes along cleats built into the frame of The Device, and then Trevor pulled the GPS device out and checked their location again. A single green LED blinked. He then carefully reached into the center of the contraption and grasped a lever near its center. He worked the ratchet back and forth for several minutes, winding a steel spring hidden within a waterproof cylinder tighter and tighter.</p>
<p>When it finally &ldquo;clicked&rdquo; tight, he stopped. He pulled back from the frame and reached into his utility belt again and brought out a small, flat, device looking like a car remote. He pushed a hidden button and a beam of pale, blue light pierced the darkness. He pointed it towards the surface and watched the microorganisms and other small creatures pass through the beam. When he was satisfied that he could see the direction of the barely perceptible current, he shut off the light. Everyone took a moment to re-adjust to relying on their mer-senses, then he signaled his girls to swim with him to the far side of The Device, and there he brought them all into a group hug.</p>
<p>[We have to secure the Dead Man&rsquo;s Trigger,] he said. [Who wants to go first?]</p>
<p>The three mermaids all looked at one another. They all remembered Pat&rsquo;s admonitions about the responsibility given them: the future of all mers and the future of the entire planet. Each felt the weight of those words weighing heavily upon their hearts, their chests tightening with emotion.</p>
<p>[God, I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re going to do this,] Kate said.</p>
<p>[I can&rsquo;t believe we HAVE to do this,] Ann said, putting her head against Trevor&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>None of them wanted to admit it, but it was difficult for them to be in the mood, so to speak. After towing their burden for nearly two days, and arriving at this great a depth, and knowing that the hulking steel framed device next to them could wipe out all life on the planet, all combined to put a damper on even a mermaid&rsquo;s libido. A few moments passed, the four of them floating silently in the darkness.</p>
<p>[We can&rsquo;t not set it,] Trevor said. [I&rsquo;ve already tightened the spring. We have to do this.]</p>
<p>[I&rsquo;ll go first!] Rose said with sudden force, twisting her body to be in front of Trevor&rsquo;s, forcing Kate to move to one side. [We&rsquo;re going to make so much love right here that this thing won&rsquo;t be able to go off for at least two years!]</p>
<p>She grabbed Trevor&rsquo;s face, which she could sense more than she could see, and kissed him fiercely. As soon as she did, her tail began flickering softly in the darkness. Soon Trevor&rsquo;s tail was also flickering as she built up their passion slowly and deliberately. Rose broke away from the kiss and floated down Trevor&rsquo;s torso, kissing and stroking his body as she descended.</p>
<p>When she got to his vent, she began teasing him until he pulled at his vent muscle, releasing his now expanding cock into the cold, dark sea. She took him into her mouth, giving it a few quick strokes, making sure her lover and mate was ready, and then she flicked her tail and rose quickly back up to his face. She kissed him again.</p>
<p>[It&rsquo;s ironic, you know,] Trevor said.</p>
<p>[What&rsquo;s ironic?] Asked Ann as she drew near, trying to add her own energy to Rose and Trevor&rsquo;s slowly growing passion.</p>
<p>[Love is what will keep the world safe,] Trevor said, giving Ann a quick kiss.</p>
<p>[Love is the only thing that can keep the world safe,] Ann said.</p>
<p>[Well then, let&rsquo;s set this trigger so that it can never go off,] Rose said huskily, her body flush with passion, her tail now flickering madly with bioluminescence.</p>
<p>[Yes, let&rsquo;s get this love-fire going,] Kate said as she floated next to Trevor opposite Ann.</p>
<p>Rose put her arms around Trevor&rsquo;s neck, and kissed him again, grinding her pelvis against his, trapping his cock between them. She turned her head, inviting Ann in for a kiss. Her sister-wife gave her a fierce kiss, massaging Rose&rsquo;s full breasts as she did. Kate pulled Trevor into a kiss from the other side. Rose continued to grind her hips into Trevor, while Ann stroked and pulled on her breasts and nipples. She felt her breasts grow heavy with milk, and she moaned into Ann&rsquo;s kiss. Rose felt Kate reach down and grasp Trevor&rsquo;s cock. She moved her hips back, and let Kate position Trevor&rsquo;s cock between her now engorged vent.</p>
<p>[I love you,] she said, looking at each of her mates in turn. She then locked eyes with Trevor as all three together pushed his cock inside her. Rose luxuriated in the feeling of fullness that his mighty penis created inside her. She held his gaze as he buried himself to the hilt, her warm depths burning like a furnace compared to the frigid water around them.</p>
<p>The lights emanating from Trevor and Rose dazzled both Kate and Ann, and they re-positioned themselves along Trevor&rsquo;s sides, where his pelvic fins were alive with light and motion. They each nestled their own vents along the ends of his fins and locked their hands behind both Rose and Trevor creating a group hug.</p>
<p>[God, this is so amazing,] Kate said.</p>
<p>[Yea,] Ann agreed, feeling her breasts swell with passion.</p>
<p>[The future of the world,] Rose said, her body tense with passion. [We have to protect the future of the world.]</p>
<p>[You guys are the future of the world,] Trevor said, wrapping his tail around Rose&rsquo;s, feeling both Ann and Kate press into him on each side, the tips of both his pelvic fins vibrating inside a fiery mermaid&rsquo;s vent.</p>
<p>Rose rolled her hips into Trevor&rsquo;s slow stroking, her vent rippling against his cock as it slowly sank into her and gripping it as he slowly withdrew. Her breasts reached their fullest as her passion rose, and she could feel the warmth of her own milk beginning to leak from her nipples.</p>
<p>Trevor&rsquo;s rhythm increased steadily, and she gave herself over to the rising power of Trevor&rsquo;s stroking, feeling her body jerk each time he slapped into her hips, the pleasure rippling outward from that point, roiling through her stomach, shaking her heavy breasts now beginning to spray milk into the murky water. Flashes of her days as Robbie appeared in the dark water around them like misty images that only sweetened the embrace they shared.</p>
<p>As her body embraced the welcome assault of Trevor&rsquo;s affections, Rose remembered her transformation in his arms and the adventures they had already shared. She remembered her parents and the long talks she had with her father before he became Jaclyn, and she wondered if her father felt the way she did when Brian made love to him/her. Trevor&rsquo;s eyes seemed to bore into hers, and in those eyes, she saw herself nearly overwhelmed with passion. She wondered if Jaclyn remembered being Hank when Brian pounded into her. Soon Trevor&rsquo;s hips were mighty pistons, and she couldn&rsquo;t help but vocalize each time he bottomed out in her womb. The dark depths kept her shrieks small and quiet, but her passion overcame the murky, oppressive depths. In the midst of her passion, Rose wondered what a child of her own might be like, and suddenly a spark of passion overtook her and gripped her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treeeeevvvvoooooooooorrrrrrr,&rdquo; she screamed into the silent depths as her body began convulsing. She tried to focus on Trevor&rsquo;s eyes, his beautiful blue eyes, but all she could see were a sparkling pair of violet eyes that she had never yet seen. She suddenly realized what she was doing, but it was too late to stop visualizing her daughter&rsquo;s eyes. Her vagina suddenly clamped down on Trevor&rsquo;s cock, stopping him just as he started an outward stroke, trapping him within her fiery depths. Rose&rsquo;s own orgasm forced her eyes to roll back in her head and her entire body convulsed around Trevor&rsquo;s now stationary cock, her breasts gushing milk into the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roooooseeeeeee,&rdquo; Trevor heaved as his cock was being magnificently massaged by muscles in Rose&rsquo;s birth canal that sought one thing; his seed. He was barely aware of Ann and Kate both starting into their own intense orgasms, thickening the water with mermaid milk, much of it drifting over and around The Device. He felt a powerful, unstoppable orgasm rise up from deep within his tail, shoot through his trapped cock, and pulse into the quivering and jerking body of Rose. After the fifth pulse, his own eyes rolled back in his head, and he joined his beloved pod-mate in blissful unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Sudhish closed his eyes as the small jet bounced in the turbulence, trying to will his stomach into submission. He tasted his own bile, but he swallowed and refocused his efforts. After a few moments he felt his stomach settle, and he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>There were eight people on the sleek, small Leer jet, and Sudhish could see that the beefy bodyguards that Malaki always had near him were laughing at his airsickness. He closed his eyes again, shutting out the brutes making up most of the passengers on the jet, focusing on memorizing the instructions he had received from Conjo. He went over them again and again, while he fingered the ring on his right hand. How Conjo had made a copy of this old ring, Sudhish didn&rsquo;t really know. But the new ring, with its hidden transmitter, looked exactly like his old, Oxford school ring.</p>
<p>Sudhish hoped that Conjo would be able to pull off this surprise attack. The five bodyguards that Malaki had brought with him were experienced, hardened, and capable men, and Sudhish knew each of them was incredibly well-armed. Malaki&rsquo;s son, Torro was also present, but he was the same size as his father. Sudhish surmised that he was along for the ride because Malaki hoped to teach him a lesson, one that probably involved his sisters. He twisted the ring with nervous anticipation. Why did all this have to happen, he thought somewhat uselessly to himself. His three beautiful sisters were now sex slaves in some wretched corner of the Philippines, and unless he could free them, they would all eventually die.</p>
<p>He screwed his eyes tightly shut as the jet dipped and bucked in the air. In the swirling colors behind his tightly clenched eyelids, he could not make the vision of Geeta, his older sister, being beaten and raped leave his mind. She was closest to him in age, and she was one of the most beautiful women he knew, even if she was his own sister. Up until two weeks ago, he lay trapped in a situation from which he did not know how to escape. Now, he had hope, not much, but it was something. He shook his head, breathing deeply, both to control his nausea and to steel his nerves for what was to come in Davao. He needed to be able to think, to act when the time came. He had no idea what Conjo&rsquo;s instructions might mean, but he was determined to follow them to the letter.</p>
<pre><code>Once in the brothel, turn the stone in the ring one-quarter turn.
Find the window or door closest to the sea. Open it, if possible.
Ignore Conjo if you see him.
If a little whale slapped her tail on the water, jump into the belly of the whale to be safe. 
</code></pre>
<p>He had no idea what that last one meant, and he worried that none of the instructions seemed to include his sisters. According to Conjo, Malaki had captured and enslaved all three of his sisters. His parents were devastated, he knew. Somehow, he would make everything right. Somehow.</p>
<p>First, he just had to survive the flight, he thought as the plane lurched again.</p>
<p>About an hour after Jackson had released Joy and Mac from the sling, allowing them to float freely in the tank. Both stopped the involuntary twitching that had plagued them for days. The three of them watched for the rest of that afternoon, but there were no other changes. They noted with relief that the other animals in the tank were completely uninterested in the two humans drifting among them. Despite a long afternoon of watching, neither Joy nor Mac showed any signs of regaining consciousness.</p>
<p>After a brief dinner break, Jackson, Annette, and Brent divided themselves into shifts to watch over the two changelings, in case they did regain consciousness. Jackson pulled a cot from a storage closet and settled down for the first shift that evening. He attached a movement alarm to the corner of each of the floats that supported the proto-mer&rsquo;s heads above the surface of the water, and then he settled into his cot. He was asleep within the hour.</p>
<p>When Annette relieved Jackson in the morning, carrying two warm mugs of coffee, she found him still asleep. After nudging him awake, they sat together for nearly an hour simply watching the tank and sipping their coffee. It was beautiful and calming. Both Joy and Mac were naked, suspended in the water by the floats around their necks, their now youthful and graceful bodies were completely still, no movement whatsoever except for the barely perceptible movement of their chests.</p>
<p>Their statuesque stillness contrasted dramatically with the constant movement of most of the other animals in the tank. The Tangs and Puffers mixed among the Parrotfish and Damsels, a few large Groupers moved lazily along, and the cuttlefish scuttled occasionally among them, the other fish avoiding them as much as possible. It was mesmerizing.</p>
<p>After Brent had spent most of the afternoon watching the tank impassively, he noticed a small change in the two humans. Tiny air bubbles covered them, sticking to their skin in odd patterns. The most densely blanketed area was over their new gills, red patches of skin that had lengthened and darkened overnight. When he called the others in for confirmation, they all noticed that nearly all of Mac&rsquo;s body hair had disappeared, and that both of them appeared to have longer hair. Still, however, there appeared to be no signs of their awakening.</p>
<p>On the second day, Jackson discovered that the tank&rsquo;s salinity had changed dramatically. He started cycling more water from the bay into the tank. They were finally able to raise Pat and the other mers on the short wave radio, and together they decided to add more salt and some key minerals to the water that the mers had discovered to be major factors in their transformations. Jackson made a quick call to Kyle Johnson, and two hours later his old friend showed up with the necessary supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure about this?&rdquo; asked Annette as she watched the Slipper approach from the northeast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust him with my life,&rdquo; Jackson said, watching his boyhood friend expertly maneuver the shabby looking craft up to the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jackson,&rdquo; Kyle greeted his old friend with a nod. &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he smiled at Annette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old friend, Kyle,&rdquo; Jackson said without inflection. &ldquo;Her name&rsquo;s Annette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annette,&rdquo; Kyle repeated, brushing his unkempt, graying hair away from his ruddy face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleased to meet you,&rdquo; Annette said with a nod of her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got your supplies,&rdquo; Kyle said as Jackson secured the lines to the dock cleats. &ldquo;It sure is a small package for being so expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you &hellip;&rdquo; Jackson began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will,&rdquo; Kyle interrupted. &ldquo;You said there was something special. The Company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annette stiffened at the now all too common nickname for her previous employer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;But the same rules apply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yup,&rdquo; Kyle returned as he bent to pick up a small, canvas sack from near his feet. &ldquo;Do you want it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you bring it on up to the house? It&rsquo;s for the Chicken Shed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yup,&rdquo; Kyle nodded, stepping up onto the dock. Kyle looked casually from Jackson to Annette as the former turned to head up to the house. &ldquo;How long have you been retired from The Company, Annette?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Annette shot Jackson a stern glance, but he already had his back to her, heading back towards the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said a word,&rdquo; Jackson answered without turning around. &ldquo;Scout&rsquo;s honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t like it when I said it the first time,&rdquo; Kyle explained as he offered to allow Annette to go up the path first. &ldquo;It weren&rsquo;t too difficult to figure out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be off my game,&rdquo; Annette said ruefully. &ldquo;Getting old,&rdquo; she grumbled, turning to follow Jackson back up to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from where I stand,&rdquo; Kyle said with only the slightest touch of lechery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men!&rdquo; Annette groused, hiding her smile from both of them.</p>
<p>Leonard Simon&rsquo;s knuckles were white as he gripped the railing of the Johanna. He had been standing along the edge of the boat, unmoving and in a near state of shock for over fifteen minutes. No one else noticed, at first, because all four were all equally shocked. Peter LaMond eventually noticed that his boat-mate didn&rsquo;t appear to be breathing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Len?&rdquo; Peter whispered. &ldquo;Len! Breathe! And stop staring!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter chuckled at Len&rsquo;s startled reaction and sheepish grin, but he also blushed at his own realization that he had been gaping at the exotic and unbelievable creatures too. In his seventy-two years of life, Peter LaMond, retired chemist, had never expected to see a mermaid, not a girl in a specially made costume so she looked like a mermaid, but an actual one. The previous day, Michael Thompson, skipper of The Johanna, had anchored along the unpopulated south eastern shore of Davao Gulf in preparation for today&rsquo;s meeting. Despite knowing that they were meeting the mers, nothing prepared them for actually seeing them for the first time.</p>
<p>Michael had positioned the boat so that the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary rose dramatically off their starboard bow, while the large and mostly placid Davao Gulf extended off their port side to the west. The provincial capital in Davao City was to the north, which allowed the recently arrived mermaids and mermen to hide in the lee of The Johanna, protected from the line of sight of passing freighters headed towards the deep-water docks reaching out into the bright, blue water along the North West fringe of the gulf.</p>
<p>The twelve mers that bobbing in the water next to the boat shared what information they had been able to glean from their several nights of reconnoitering. Peter, Len, and Liz had watched with growing amazement as each pod, or family group, shared their bits of information. The most animated were Mu Su and his three girls. The triplets were identical mermaids, each with beautiful blue and white mottled tails sparkling with flashes of yellow, their tails gently swaying beneath them. It was impossible for Peter to tell them apart, but he could see that one was shyer than the other two, while Mu Su simply seemed to radiate quiet strength.</p>
<p>The obvious leader of the three pods was the merman with the long, black and purple tail, Mark who had an astoundingly diverse pod. Mark had the steely-eyed look of command, and both Mu Su and Wong, the other merman, deferred to him at every important juncture of their reports.</p>
<p>However, Peter noticed with some surprise, that all three of the mermen deferred to their mermaids as a rule. That fact made the beautiful Trixi, a blond mermaid with a striped blue and yellow tail, the true leader of the group. She also seemed to mother all of them, especially Mu Su and his girls.</p>
<p>Despite his air of command, Mark often turned to her so she could summarize and translate some of the more excitable reports from the other mermaids. Never far from Trixi&rsquo;s side was Homa, a dramatically beautiful Persian mermaid with a dark red and orange tail, luxuriously curly hair, and eyes that seemed ready to cut steel with the slightest glance. Homa was certainly one mermaid Peter made note never to cross. The final mermaid in Mark&rsquo;s pod was Binah, an equally dark and beautiful mermaid, sharing the same dramatic coloring as Homa, but her intensely curly hair and ebony human half marked her African origins.</p>
<p>The last pod was lead by Wong and his equally exotic mermaids. Two of his mermaids were of Asian descent, like MuSu and Wong, and the girls had dragon red tails marked by gold and silver highlights. Shen and Lin shared nearly identical faces, long, straight, black hair that cascaded over their slender, dramatically more delicate figures, especially when compared to the other mermaids, but both sisters also shared that sinewy strength visible in the more generously proportioned mermaids in the other pods. Their third sister-wife, as Peter had learned they called one-another, was a classic French beauty, Esmée, whose tail coloring gave testament to her French ancestry and patriotism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; Peter admonished as he gently lifted Len&rsquo;s chin up from his chest, causing his crewmate to stir in reaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mermaids!&rdquo; Len exclaimed, interrupting the report Emma was giving on their discovery of a duplicate of the Little Mermaid statue in Denmark on the other side of the peninsula. The mers all turned to look at Len, who was gripping the boat&rsquo;s railing with white-knuckled amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he stuttered. &ldquo;Please continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Emma continued with a smile for the still-stunned Len. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s perched on a few rocks along a really depressing seaside park in Manti City they call the Davao Baywalk. It&rsquo;s really pathetic, though. Sort of like they got started with something and then ran out of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; Rikki chimed in. &ldquo;It looks just like the one in Copenhagen, but she&rsquo;s plastic, I think. You can see where they painted her to look bronze, and the paint&rsquo;s, like, chipping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Totally,&rdquo; Cleo agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;ve seen that statue in person, even if it is the fake one, I have to say, she doesn&rsquo;t look anything like us,&rdquo; Phoebe said. &ldquo;I think we turned out much prettier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we should return to the subject of rescuing your mother?&rdquo; MuSu suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; exclaimed Cleo. &ldquo;What have you been able to find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t be sure of anything,&rdquo; Michael Thompson began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is alive!&rdquo; Rikki protested, as Emma and Cleo nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; Michael said carefully. &ldquo;We have made contact with Joy&rsquo;s exCIA mole, Conjo, and he reports that an elderly Australian woman is functioning as the cleaning woman and maid for the girls at the brothel. She could very well be your mother, but &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; asked Rikki worriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conjo reports that this woman has been severely disfigured,&rdquo; Michael continued as the triplets gasped, while their pod-mate&rsquo;s eyes flinched into a squint of pure malice. &ldquo;She seems to have suffered both physical mutilation and facial disfigurement. It was impossible to match her to your description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Mark evenly, his commander voice rising above the now sobbing girls. &ldquo;The women in that brothel deserve to be rescued, and some men and women deserve to be killed. We have a plan, and I think it can be successful. I would suggest that we not waste one more minute. If the woman is their mother, we won&rsquo;t help her much by waiting. If she is not, we can rescue as many as possible, and then search in other locations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark is right,&rdquo; MuSu said gently. &ldquo;We should move quickly to rescue these women, and hope for the best. On the other hand, do we really want to wait until Malaki and his bodyguards arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too big a prize to ignore,&rdquo; Mark answered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be far away from his home base, and we are unlikely to have such an opportunity in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; MuSu agreed. &ldquo;Waiting is &hellip; difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We gain more by waiting,&rdquo; Mark reassured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure that you will be able to handle Malaki and his thugs?&rdquo; asked Michael. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it make more sense to do a surprise rescue, and then lure Malaki to our home base?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll be surprised at what a mer can do, both in and out of the water,&rdquo; answered Mark. &ldquo;He will be traveling light and fast, rather than slow and powerful. He is here, he thinks, to punish an errant son, and not contend with an ambush by sea creatures no one actually believes in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it will be hard to keep things under wraps after this rescue mission,&rdquo; Michael surmised. &ldquo;All the other mers are ready for this kind of exposure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actual mermaids rescuing sex-trafficked human women,&rdquo; Trixi said with a smile. &ldquo;It will shake up the world, but in a good way, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see how my country reacts to powerful, naked women attacking the power of men,&rdquo; Homa said with a fierce smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine too,&rdquo; Liz said, smiling down at the mers she now hoped to join.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We move forward with our plans, then,&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;Do you have the supplies we&rsquo;ve given you stored safely?&rdquo; he asked with a nod towards Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the containers,&rdquo; Peter answered, tapping a satchel he had slung over one shoulder. &ldquo;I
have your instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Mark approved. &ldquo;We should get moving. It will take you the rest of the day to get The Johanna into position. I suggest you weigh anchor now. We will rendezvous with you at midnight after you do your show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will play the parts of rich perverts and find out as much as possible,&rdquo; Michael said, turning quickly to move to the captain&rsquo;s wheel. &ldquo;Len?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On it,&rdquo; Len answered, tearing himself from looking at the most amazing creatures he had ever seen.</p>
<p>Joy Simpson felt as if she was stuck in a spider&rsquo;s web, her body suspended and trapped by millions of tiny strands, her limbs twitching against her restraints. She tried to shake her head and open her eyes. A shrill tone sounded in her left ear, repeatedly. She felt the web stir; the spider was coming for her. She struggled to move, but her body felt as if it was buried beneath a sea of cotton, a thick mush from which she could not free herself. The beeping stopped, and she felt a touch on her head. She flinched away from it, adrenaline surging through her body. The spider!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joy!&rdquo; Annette shouted. &ldquo;Stop thrashing and WAKE UP.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joy recognized the voice, and tried to turn her head towards it. She felt something rub along her chin, and slowly forced her arm to her face. She felt the float that was around her neck, and realized that she wasn&rsquo;t in cotton&ndash;she was in water. She focused her full efforts into opening her eyes. She felt one eyelid flutter and she nearly cried out with happiness. She blinked again, and light crashed into her eyes. She felt moisture on her face, and she could now feel the water all around her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming to,&rdquo; Brent said.</p>
<p>Joy blinked again and saw the faces of her friends as well as two strangers she didn&rsquo;t recognize. She opened her mouth to speak, but her dry throat allowed only a croak to emerge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her some water,&rdquo; Annette urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s IN water,&rdquo; one stranger answered. The other, taller stranger disappeared for a second and returned with a plastic bottle of water and handed it to Annette.</p>
<p>Joy let Annette dribble the water onto her lips, licking them greedily. As her awareness grew, she also discovered that she was hungry. No, she was starving!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac?&rdquo; asked Joy, her voice raspy and weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right beside you,&rdquo; Annette answered, turning Joy&rsquo;s body so that she could see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food?&rdquo; Joy croaked, after being reassured at seeing a young but haggard looking Mac floating next to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you like?&rdquo; Annette asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything!&rdquo; Joy croaked again, louder now that her voice was returning.</p>
<p>The two strangers both dropped from sight, and Joy heard them as they scrambled away from the water where she floated. A second later, she heard a heavy door open and close, the echoing, dull sound suggesting they were underground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Joy asked as Annette fed her more water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe, an island in the lower Chesapeake Bay, an old friend&rsquo;s house, his private aquarium,&rdquo; Annette answered with the standard protocol.</p>
<p>Joy continued drinking the water as Annette fed it to her, increasing both her strength and her awareness. A few moments later, the two strangers reappeared in her vision and began handing Annette bottles. Annette opened one of them, and held it to Joy&rsquo;s lips. As the thick, chalky fluid oozed into her mouth, Joy fought the urge to spit it out. She recognized the flavor, knowing it was exactly what her body needed. Ensure!</p>
<p>How do old people drink this shit, Joy wondered, forcing herself to drink it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but we figured that since you hadn&rsquo;t eaten in several days, you probably needed the calories and minerals in this stuff,&rdquo; Annette said, watching Joy choke down the liquid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; said Joy, her voice stronger now but her hunger overwhelmed all other sensations.</p>
<p>Annette opened another bottle of the vile, white liquid and lifted it to Joy&rsquo;s lips. Joy raised her hand from the water and took the bottle from her friend. She tilted it back, forcing the soupy concoction into her body, feeling her body react to the first food she had eaten in days. She took a third bottle, forcing that down, her body now responding with speed and power to her commands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save the chocolate for Mac,&rdquo; Joy said in a clearer voice, her strength returning with miraculous speed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the vanilla; he hates vanilla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annette returned the dark bottle to Jackson&rsquo;s waiting hand and handed her another pale white bottle of Ensure. She downed that one and felt the hunger beginning to back off. She looked at her hand as she took the now empty bottle away from her lips. She could see that her hands had returned to the smooth, even complexion of her youth. The veins were still visible, probably because she had been starving to death, but the color and texture of her skin were the same as when she was a girl. She saw the webbing between her fingers, and she knew that her final transition couldn&rsquo;t be far off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to wake Mac up,&rdquo; Joy said urgently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Annette asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;How did you wake me up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We added a lot of minerals and chemicals to the water, and then you started twitching and struggling, and so I just shouted at you,&rdquo; Annette said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shout at him,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be unconscious when we change; we have to concentrate on the change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concentrating makes a difference to a microscopic parasite?&rdquo; asked the tall thin stranger next to Annette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mer-organs,&rdquo; Joy said, feeling her hunger rise again. &ldquo;We develop proto-mer-organs and they respond to our psychosomatic system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annette mentioned those organs earlier,&rdquo; said Jackson. &ldquo;Mind and body, psychosomatic system, I get it. That&rsquo;s why placebos work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more complex than that, but that&rsquo;s a start,&rdquo; agreed Joy.</p>
<p>Brent reached over to the still unmoving Mac and started shaking and shouting at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything more solid?&rdquo; Joy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold cuts?&rdquo; the tall, thin, stranger offered as he extended a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jackson Baker,&rdquo; Annette said as Joy took the proffered sliced ham and stuffed it into her mouth in large bites. &ldquo;Jack to his friends. He&rsquo;s a former computer scientist and programmer, and a collector of marine life. This over here is Kyle Johnson, a friend of Jack&rsquo;s, and you know Brent,&rdquo; she finished indicating each. Brent paused from his shaking and shouting to smile at Joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More,&rdquo; Joy asked, her hand extended towards Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be hungry,&rdquo; Kyle observed in his Eastern Shore drawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no idea,&rdquo; Joy muttered as she stuffed the food into her mouth as quickly as Jackson handed it to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure that the calcium count went down?&rdquo; Pat asked into the short wave radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Annette answered from Jackson&rsquo;s radio room in the main house. &ldquo;We tracked all the counts, calcium-carbonate, sulfate, phosphate, all of them, and they all went down, but calcium went down the most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, according to our data, that means that the microorganisms are firmly established within the tank,&rdquo; Pat answered. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re sure that the metallic counts went down an hour after you added the powdered versions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Annette repeated. &ldquo;We could only do crude measurements, but we tracked them all, aluminum, beryllium, copper, lead and magnesium. They all went down within an hour. Both Joy and Mac are now conscious, and they are working on regaining the body mass they lost. But nothing else seems to be happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Pat answered. &ldquo;We think that their bodies responded to the war for resources with the microorganisms by shutting down as much as possible to preserve basic body functions. That&rsquo;s why they both regained consciousness once we stopped the war for resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great now that they are both awake,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;But they are still weak and report extreme discomfort when they are out of the pool for any length of time. They say it&rsquo;s like their skin is being burned off in the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not good,&rdquo; Pat agreed. &ldquo;Are there any other symptoms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None that we can see,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;Both Joy and Mac are more irritable than normal, but that might be simply because they&rsquo;re cooped up in the tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like we were cooped up in the Moon Pool,&rdquo; Pat said, remembering. &ldquo;How long has the chemical conditions of the tank remained stable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over six hours,&rdquo; Annette answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that IS great,&rdquo; answered Pat. &ldquo;It confirms our data here, but with even more tightly controlled circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More?&rdquo; Annette asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Moon Pool and environs has millions of gallons of sea water flowing through it constantly,&rdquo; Pat answered. &ldquo;Now we have confirmation on the ratio of suspended metals to microorganism activity, whereas before we could only guess here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know exactly how much water and how many heavy elements were added,&rdquo; Annette agreed, understanding. &ldquo;But why hasn&rsquo;t anything else happened, and why can&rsquo;t they get out of the tank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but it could be because of the way the siren cells were introduced into their bodies, through an infection rather than by infusion.&rdquo; Pat answered. &ldquo;They swam through the Moon Pool, probably allowing some of the parasites to enter through a break in their skin or by swallowing water. They didn&rsquo;t drink any mermaid milk, so their systems were never directly infused with live siren cells, only the viral form in the parasites. We think that eventually, a person needs actual mermaid milk to initiate the final change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we going to get mermaid milk from the middle of the Pacific Ocean to the Chesapeake Bay?&rdquo; Annette asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Joy started lactating?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she called it leaking, but its more like a slow drip than something she&rsquo;s producing when someone suckles on her,&rdquo; Annette answered. &ldquo;Is that mermaid milk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope so,&rdquo; Pat answered, looking at Phoebe, Alexis, and Galina surrounding her. &ldquo;How often is she lactating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only noticed it for the first time this morning,&rdquo; Annette answered.</p>
<p>There was a brief pause, and Annette could hear the mermaids talking in low tones because Pat didn&rsquo;t lift her finger from the call button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think Joy is probably producing enough siren cells within her own body so that she and Mac can start their transition,&rdquo; Pat announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we need to do?&rdquo; Annette asked, readying her pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Pat said with a smile, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; Annette repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing YOU can do,&rdquo; Pat explained. &ldquo;They need to start feeding from one another. It shouldn&rsquo;t take much, but they have to bump up their internal siren cell counts, over-load their bodies with them, and that should create a tipping point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tipping point?&rdquo; Annette asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A point of no-return,&rdquo; Pat explained. &ldquo;Once a certain level has been reached, the transition should be inevitable; nothing will stop it. But that high saturation needs to be reached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, how does Joy feed on Mac,&rdquo; Annette asked. She paused, and then added, &ldquo;Oh, never mind. I figured that one out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smart girl,&rdquo; Pat said giggling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Experienced girl,&rdquo; Annette answered, giggling as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Radio back when they&rsquo;ve finished,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;Is there any concern about their skin condition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another brief sound of discussion, and then silence as Pat released the call button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Pat?&rdquo; Annette said after a few moments of silence. &ldquo;Do you copy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a minute here,&rdquo; Pat said, after a second or two. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking up some stuff from the last data set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annette sat in silence for a few more moments and then looked out the window to watch the gray clouds scurry across the bay. The radio room in the Baker house faced north, and the bay was wide this far down the Chesapeake. Annette could see a container ship lumbering up the bay, but it was a good deal further up the bay than the island upon which she sat.</p>
<p>The view from this window was mostly water, though the Eastern Shore was visible from any window looking east. She wondered how long it would take to swim to Mermaid Island. They probably could cut through the Panama Canal, but they would risk exposure, and the water was probably not the cleanest or clearest in the world. All that traffic. Ugh. The route all the way down to the Straits of Magellan didn&rsquo;t appeal to her either. So cold down at the southern tip of South America, so close to Antarctica. She knew that the mers could tolerate extreme temperatures, but still &hellip; cold!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annette?&rdquo; Pat&rsquo;s voice crackled over the radio, interrupting Annette&rsquo;s daydreaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t find any anomalies that might explain that particular symptom,&rdquo; Pat said, the worry present in her voice even over the short wave radio. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it, but there doesn&rsquo;t seem much we can do about it. All the species of aquatic life that you&rsquo;ve identified in the Baker Aquarium are also present in these seas, though some are the Atlantic variations. I hope it&rsquo;s just a side effect of never having ingested an actual siren cell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, they should try to initiate their transitions?&rdquo; Annette asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and keep your fingers crossed,&rdquo; Pat returned. &ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger, over and out,&rdquo; Annette said, clicking off the radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go,&rdquo; she said to herself as she rose and headed downstairs towards the basement entrance to the tank.</p>
<p>Len Simon looked down at the cell phone in his slightly shaking hand. It wasn&rsquo;t his normal smart phone; it was a prepaid not-so-smart-phone. The dumb phone wasn&rsquo;t why his hand was shaking. In the past twenty-four hours, Peter and Len, acting as rich American perverts, had met with Anjo, and guided to this brothel by Conjo, the ex-mole for Joy Simpson. Len remembered Conjo&rsquo;s story as Michael Thompson had told it on the trip to Davao. Just like the mermaids, nothing seemed to prepare Len for the man when he finally met him.</p>
<p>Conjo was a tiny, wizened old man, and like an ancient Zen master, he seemed to radiate both strength and weakness at the same moment. Any questions or fears Len had were erased as he watched Conjo handle Anjo, the manager at the brothel in which the woman they suspected was Emma Henderson worked as a maid.</p>
<p>Within only a few short minutes Anjo had gone from a highly distrustful and reluctant pimp to an eager and open business partner. No, it wasn&rsquo;t Conjo&rsquo;s seeming weakness and frailty nor Anjo&rsquo;s all too apparent sliminess that had Len&rsquo;s hand shaking; it was the women.</p>
<p>Len had seen dozens of women, some of them impossibly beautiful, and some of them shockingly young. All of them had the strangest look in their eyes, a frightening mixture of emptiness, fear, and hatred. That look had Len&rsquo;s hand shaking. The women who paraded before them had not the slightest spark of pleasure in their eyes; none of the smiles seemed genuine, and fear clouded the features of each girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Never had he seen human life treated so cheaply, making him all the more eager to escape both from the brothel and from that label: human. Len knew that human life was cheap, especially in the face of poverty, but he had to force himself to confront it. The visceral cruelty he saw all around him turned his stomach, making his hands shake with anger.</p>
<p>He fought to control his body. Again he reviewed the plans they had made. Oh, God! What plans! It may be that every little boy pretends to be James Bond or some sort of hero, but when the fantasy becomes reality, the hopes and dreams of a little boy get smashed to smithereens.</p>
<p>Len stifled a smile, remembering how he had balked when Michael and Mark first described how they hoped to rescue the girls from the brothel and capture Malaki and his men. What they had described would take five James Bonds, and Len knew that he, himself, was no James Bond! He didn&rsquo;t want to go into the belly of the beast, but when all was said and done, Len could see why it had to be Peter and him that went into there.</p>
<p>Michael Thompson was too recognizable throughout the Pacific, and Malaki knew him by name and face. Liz Wainwright was also recognizable, but more importantly, she was an unlikely consumer at a brothel, particularly since she was in a wheelchair. Conjo&rsquo;s role had to be in the background, though he hinted that he would be coming from within the city with some sort of force after his signal. Conjo&rsquo;s possible army would likely be armed only with knives and machetes rather than guns, so their plan had to work prior to Conjo&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>That left Peter and him as complete unknowns. They could act like anything and get away it, and they could pass off their inconsistencies as eccentricities. Besides, they were paying good money for a terrible and gruesome request, but no one would look past the money.</p>
<p>None of these thoughts seemed to comfort Len while sitting next to Peter, his hand shaking. They sat together in the plush parlor of the otherwise shabby and ugly brothel. The dark read furniture and gaudy lighting only seemed to reinforce the tawdry and ugly business undertaken on the premises. Len could see the dock extending into the bay, visible through the large picture window that faced east. He looked away from the window and back towards Anjo, flanked by two beefy guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worry,&rdquo; Anjo said to Peter and Len, rubbing his hands in anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can meet our needs?&rdquo; Peter asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure!&rdquo; Anjo said with his heavy accent. &ldquo;But now two hundred thousand American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said twenty-five thousand yesterday,&rdquo; Peter said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No can lose many girls one night,&rdquo; Anjo explained. &ldquo;Many weeks pass before more girls &hellip; come. This a business problem, only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We appreciate your business problems, but the notice is short. We were expecting to consummate our deal tonight,&rdquo; answered Peter in a surprisingly menacing tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have orders,&rdquo; Anjo said, spreading his hands helplessly. &ldquo;I sorry. Orders from above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would like to negotiate,&rdquo; Peter said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above no negotiate,&rdquo; Anjo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am afraid we will look elsewhere to satisfy our business,&rdquo; Peter said, standing, nudging Len to stand as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Anjo said, moving towards the door as though to block their leaving. &ldquo;You no find this business anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can find this business right around the corner in Tugbok, Bunawan, Panabo, and Tori,&rdquo; Len said, putting his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;We can find this business in thousands of places all over the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but &hellip; &quot; Anjo answered, backing away. &ldquo;I do many things &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>Anjo stopped talking as a group of well-dressed men entered from one of the side rooms that surrounded the parlor, three small men, and five large ones. The larger ones spread out along two walls, casually checking out the room, the windows, and Len and Peter. One of the three smaller ones waved a hand at Anjo, who quickly scurried over to him. They whispered briefly, and Anjo and his two henchmen arranged themselves along the windows that faced the bay. A moment passed in silence as everyone carefully surveyed the new arrangement.</p>
<p>As Peter and Len stood near the center of the room, Len continued to toy with the phone in his hand, trying not to let his own fears show on his face. He kept remembering the most pain-in-the-ass-days as a young lawyer, and forced those emotions play across his visage. He tried to glance casually around the room too, and noted that the elegantly dressed henchmen were obviously carrying weapons beneath their shirts. The room suddenly felt hotter and stuffier than it had. The smaller man who looked the oldest (and the one Len hoped and feared would be revealed as Malaki) nodded at one of his associates, who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business is business,&rdquo; the small, Indian man who looked like an accountant said. Len could see that the man was clearly terrified. He shared a glance with Peter, and they both nodded imperceptibly: the older man was probably Malaki. Everything looked like the descriptions that Conjo gave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With whom are we doing business?&rdquo; Peter asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Sudhish, Mr. Dimaunahan&rsquo;s personal secretary,&rdquo; the young man explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these other men?&rdquo; asked Peter, nodding at the well-dressed but otherwise silent man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business is business,&rdquo; Sudhish repeated.</p>
<p>Peter watched the flicker of all the other men&rsquo;s eyes as they all looked to the person they suspected of being Malaki Dimaunahan. He nodded at Len, and Len secretly pushed a speed-dial button on his phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are prepared to do business,&rdquo; Peter said with a smile. &ldquo;But not at the price your associate has named.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The price is not negotiable,&rdquo; answered Sudhish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might we be more flexible on the terms, then?&rdquo; Peter asked.</p>
<p>Sudhish turned to the one they thought to be Malaki and lifted an eyebrow. This man leaned into his assistant&rsquo;s ear and whispered something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How flexible?&rdquo; Sudhish asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half now, and half after we are finished with our business,&rdquo; Peter offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have one hundred twenty-five thousand here?&rdquo; Anjo asked, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business is business,&rdquo; Peter answered. &ldquo;We are prepared to do business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; Malaki said and his henchmen glanced at him, surprised, but then all of them straightened up and took a more forward stance as though ordered to stand at attention. Anjo&rsquo;s two henchmen noticed the change and they too raised themselves on the balls of their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about it,&rdquo; Len answered in his best, bored lawyer tones. &ldquo;One press on this phone and a small army will descend on this place and rip it&ndash;and the people within it&ndash;apart until they find us or our bodies. It really isn&rsquo;t worth it, Mr. Dimaunahan. We know the cost of business, but we&rsquo;re not stupid. No one in this room wants anyone else in the world to know about our business, so let&rsquo;s see if we can all avoid a call to a rescue team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malaki startled at the use of his name, and gave Peter and Len a more appreciative look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very interesting&rdquo; Malaki said with a sickly smile, indicating that he had been thinking about taking their money. &ldquo;However, I must insist that we get paid before we begin your business.&rdquo; The henchmen all relaxed back into their neutral stance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must conduct our business tonight,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;We can give you half now, and call to have the rest delivered while we are undertaking our business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will your business take?&rdquo; Malaki asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We normally like to take our time,&rdquo; Peter said, looking at Len as though they were trying to explain how long it took to play a round of golf. &ldquo;Six girls and two of us, oh, I&rsquo;d say about three hours or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, about that,&rdquo; Len agreed, but feeling sick nevertheless. &ldquo;We like to enjoy ourselves.&rdquo; Len thought back to when they first planned the rescue. They had wanted to take all the girls, but they couldn&rsquo;t fit thirty-three girls in the Johanna. They had to settle for what they could do, and try to make sure they saved those they actually attempted to save.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can have the rest of the money delivered within those three hours?&rdquo; asked Malaki.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; answered Len. &ldquo;It just takes a phone call,&rdquo; he finished waving the phone in front of him.</p>
<p>Malaki thought it over. He had hoped to string these clients out, delay them by a day or so, so he could work on finding out more about them. He didn&rsquo;t like this situation, but as he had been saying, business is business. He didn&rsquo;t want to risk a quarter of a million dollars, but he also didn&rsquo;t want one of his sons to show up and surprise him and his men. Not liking his options he said, &ldquo;We must witness your business here this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You share our tastes?&rdquo; Peter asked, as though he might be talking about building model airplanes rather than watching young girls die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business is business,&rdquo; Malaki said with a smile. &ldquo;If you wish to delay full payment, then we will witness your business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malaki watched as Len and Peter conferred over the new terms, nursing the bad feeling he had about these two men. Malaki&rsquo;s relatively long life in a business that tolerated few old men had been due, in part, to his uncanny intuition. Right now, his intuition was thumping like a brass band. He wondered if they had any connection to the disappearances of his sons, but nothing seemed obvious. His sons, as far as he knew, didn&rsquo;t engage in snuff pornography, but he wouldn&rsquo;t put it past them. Something was up &hellip; something was wrong, and he wanted to be nearby, with his own men, to make sure things didn&rsquo;t get further out of control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If everyone is out on the dock, that changes everything,&rdquo; Peter whispered to Len. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t rescue them if we&rsquo;re being watched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; argued Len. &ldquo;It will put them right into the arms of the mers. It&rsquo;s perfect!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how will we coordinate or change our plans?&rdquo; Peter insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mers are smart,&rdquo; Len reassured him. &ldquo;They will adapt our original plans to the new situation. We just have to make a show of how we plan to enjoy our festivities to give the mers long enough to come up with a new plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure about this?&rdquo; Peter whispered, glancing over where Malaki and his men still watched them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Len answered, feeling strangely calm. It was like when he was arguing a case, and the right evidence just clicked into place, and he just knew that it would go his way. He straightened up away from Peter and turned to Malaki.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are normally very private men,&rdquo; Len began, hoping his nervousness helped with the explanation he was about to give. &ldquo;So, if you please, can you and your men arrange to be on the far ends of the dock, rather than on the same dock? We may have different tastes, but surely you can agree that the indulgence of our tastes must be as much our own as is possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malaki glanced out through the windows at the brothel&rsquo;s dock, which was now empty, as per the instructions these two men had given Anjo the previous evening. The dock was E-shaped and faced southeast, extending its fingers out into the bay, two long arms with the shorter one in the middle. Apparently, these two men were going to have sex with the girls in the water, and then they would drown them. Malaki never shied away from killing anyone, but this was a strange way to satisfy a kink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may use the center dock, and we will keep to the sides,&rdquo; Malaki said. &ldquo;Will that satisfy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Len answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we do business,&rdquo; Anjo said, clearly delighted with how things were going. &ldquo;You pick girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Peter said, as he handed him a list they had made from their previous visit.</p>
<p>Anjo made a show of trying to read the list, but Malaki saved him and took the paper from him. He looked it over for a moment. &ldquo;There is one girl I&rsquo;d like to ask that you remove,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have an interest in one of these women?&rdquo; Peter asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, his youngest sister,&rdquo; he finished with nod towards his assistant.</p>
<p>Suhdish could not stifle the cry that rose from his throat, but nor could he stop Torro&rsquo;s hand that clamped over his face as he took a step towards his boss. He immediately recognized the futility of any further struggle, and slumped in the arms of his captor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; Peter said, keeping his face impassive. &ldquo;We had hoped to take all three sisters with us. That is part of our taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in need of at least one,&rdquo; Malaki said. &ldquo;You can have the two others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she should join her brother in watching?&rdquo; Peter suggested. &ldquo;Would that be useful to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an interesting man,&rdquo; Malaki said. &ldquo;I believe it may be useful,&rdquo; he said as he watched Sudhish sag further into his son&rsquo;s arms. Yes, that would serve nicely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy to be helpful,&rdquo; Peter answered. &ldquo;May we begin our business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Malaki answered. &ldquo;If you will answer me one more question. Why the old woman?&rdquo; he asked pointing to one of the names, Emma, there was no last name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some rather special tastes,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;She reminds me of my mother,&rdquo; he finished with what he hoped was his best evil look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think many men might share that particular taste,&rdquo; Malaki said with a smile. &ldquo;Do you wish to substitute another girl for the one I requested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Peter said casually, his stomach secretly turning. &ldquo;Having her watch is just as delightful. You see, the number isn&rsquo;t important, it&rsquo;s the circumstances that makes it special. You can&rsquo;t just throw everyone into the belly of a whale, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belly of a whale?&rdquo; Malaki asked.</p>
<p>Peter watched as Suhdish processed that last bit, and stifled a smile of his own when he saw the young man glance at himself and Peter with a new understanding. Conjo had done his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea takes and does not yield up its dead,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;We like to play our games, have our special fun, before we let the sea have her dead. But the thrill comes from many sources, not just the obvious one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are strange men,&rdquo; Malaki said. &ldquo;But if you are prepared to do business, we should complete this transaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter nodded to Len, and Len took out the thick envelope he had in his pocket. He tossed it to Anjo who caught it and rifled through it quickly. &ldquo;Real American,&rdquo; Anjo said breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it enough?&rdquo; Malaki asked, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we let him count while we get started,&rdquo; Len said with a smile. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re short, we&rsquo;ll double the difference in the second payment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gambler?&rdquo; Malaki asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never gamble,&rdquo; Len said. &ldquo;Not with money. It&rsquo;s exactly one hundred, twenty-five thousand dollars. We thought something like this might happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting men,&rdquo; Malaki repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We try to be,&rdquo; Len said as he made a show of dialing a number on the cell phone. &ldquo;We try to be very interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac stretched himself in the water, feeling a power and flexibility he hadn&rsquo;t felt since his early twenties. There was no pain, no hitching joints, no problems! His body felt completely rejuvenated. Well, his back was covered with his new gills, and he couldn&rsquo;t seem to stay out of the water for any length of time, but that seemed a minor price to pay for the return of his youth. He kicked his legs and surfaced next to Joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, this is my worst nightmare,&rdquo; Joy exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to join Sally and Eric as mers?&rdquo; Mac asked, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Joy said, drumming her fingers along the top of the plexiglass wall of the tank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to be a mermaid, but I can&rsquo;t stand being trapped, at the mercy of these parasites. I just want to get out, go take a walk, anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac looked carefully at his lover, now young but clearly agitated. They had tried several times to leave the tank, but within mere seconds, it seemed, they were overcome with an intense discomfort, almost like itching, but deeper and more painful, that covered their entire body. Nothing was visible to them; their skin looked perfect, young, pliant, and smooth. However, something was wrong. It had felt as though their skin might burn away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going for a walk would be a bad idea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we ever made it past that chair,&rdquo; he finished nodding his head towards a chair that sat only a few feet away from the edge of the tank wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might never WALK again,&rdquo; Joy said with frustration.</p>
<p>They floated in silence for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Mac agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little bit terrifying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid; I just hate being trapped,&rdquo; Joy repeated. &ldquo;Walk or swim, but do something. This soaking and waiting is driving me crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my face is getting &hellip;&rdquo; Mac started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Joy said irritably, &ldquo;mine too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they both let go of the side of the tank and slipped beneath the water, allowing their gills to collect oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. After a long time floating, Annette and Brent came into the chamber. Annette waved them to the surface as she entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat says you two should start feeding one another,&rdquo; she said as they both surfaced together and looked down at their friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would that do anything?&rdquo; Mac asked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been eating all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From our bodies,&rdquo; Joy answered, immediately understanding. &ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m probably producing mermaid milk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Annette answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Pat and the others concluded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great! Ready?&rdquo; Joy asked turning to Mac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Born ready,&rdquo; he said smiling back at the lovely young woman floating next to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want us to leave?&rdquo; Brent asked, suddenly feeling awkward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can stay or go,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to us. The mers seem to have very little modesty about them, and we might as well get used to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;You might as well see what you&rsquo;re in for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annette and Brent glanced at one another, and both came to the same decision at the same time. They joined hands and walked over to the cot Jack had set up and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it,&rdquo; Mac said, as he kissed Joy soundly, feeling his own cock respond to the impending excitement.</p>
<p>As they sank beneath the surface once again, Joy was suddenly aware of how full her breasts were and how the salty water gave them more lift than they normally possessed. Her dark nipples oozed milk in anticipation of the feeding. She offered her right breast to Mac, and he began to suckle. The milk that had been barely present early that morning when they made love was now a torrent of fluid. As he suckled at her warm, heavy breast, he could feel the energy in Joy&rsquo;s body rise as she reveled in the act of feeding. He could also feel a shift in his own body as the siren cells from Joy&rsquo;s milk built up in his body. Mac drained one and moved on to the other. When he was finished, he could feel things were very different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was amazing,&rdquo; Joy said, bubbles escaping from her mouth, her eyes lidded with passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mac agreed, but as he was about to continue speaking, his body suddenly went into spasms, and his eyes went blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac!&rdquo; Joy screamed, startled. Annette and Brent stood up and came to the edge of the tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac!&rdquo; Joy repeated, bubbles rising from her mouth. She reached out to shake him. &ldquo;You have to concentrate on the change! Wake UP!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac&rsquo;s eyes were unresponsive, but his body began to stiffen. Joy pressed her ear to his chest, hearing the reassuring thumping of his heartbeat. Joy noticed that small bubbles seemed to be reappearing all over his body, and she released him from the hug and shook him forcefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac?&rdquo; she tried to get a response, but he was in some sort of trance or seizure. She hoped he wasn&rsquo;t in pain. Mac&rsquo;s body went into spasms again, and Joy felt a twinge in her own body. Not both of them! That would be a disaster!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Mac,&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>He remained unresponsive, but her twitch grew into an itch, and she discovered that it was an itch to vocalize. She remembered how Pat had described their first changes, and so she reached out a hand to touch him, and when she made contact, she closed her eyes and began to hum.</p>
<p>Annette and Brent watched with open mouths as Mac&rsquo;s body formed a cross in the water, his legs stretching towards the bottom of the tank and his arms out stretched at ninety-degree angles from his torso. The sound of Joy&rsquo;s humming was otherworldly, barely audible in the room, soft and sweet.</p>
<p>Annette noticed that the fish in the tank seemed agitated. They began to swim with greater energy, and several of the larger fish began to make a full circuit of the tank with some speed, the smaller fish darting among them. A few cuttlefish, normally shy and hidden, darted along the back of the tank, sharing in the agitation and energy. A few even shot out towards Mac and Joy, but then scuttled back into the reefs and rocks in which they normally hid.</p>
<p>The moments ticked by as they watched the slow, graceful ballet in the tank build in speed and intensity. They noticed that Mac and Joy had begun to spin, perhaps because of the fish that seemed to be generating a whirlpool effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my god,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Brent agreed. &ldquo;Should we call Jack and Kyle down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they can watch us change,&rdquo; Annette said, her eyes shining as she watched her old friends spin in the tank.</p>
<p>Inside the tank, Joy kept her hand on Mac&rsquo;s torso and focused her mind on his change. She imagined a black tail for him, with silver highlights, but the discomfort she had felt when they were out of the water had returned, a low-grade ache that throbbed over her entire body. She fought to concentrate, but the demands on her were too much. Her humming continued, but she couldn&rsquo;t keep her mind focused on Mac. She closed her eyes and hummed.</p>
<p>Hummed.</p>
<p>Hummed.</p>
<p>Hummed.</p>
<p>[What are they doing?] Mark asked, his surprise visible in his CHEW.</p>
<p>[They&rsquo;re lining up along the dock,] MuSu reported. [All of them. I have no idea what Peter and Len said to them, but whatever it was, it&rsquo;s an opportunity we can&rsquo;t pass up.]</p>
<p>[I would like to trust this,] Mark said. [How much time do we have, do you think?]</p>
<p>Mark felt the connection weaken as MuSu directed his CHEW to someone else. A moment later, it returned.</p>
<p>[Ten minutes,] he said.</p>
<p>[Thanks,] Mark said. [How many bogies?]</p>
<p>[Eleven bad guys, plus the six girls, our two, and one terrified assistant] MuSu answered.</p>
<p>[What&rsquo;s the arrangement?] Mark asked.</p>
<p>[Nine guys are easily reached simply by jumping over them,] MuSu reported. [The two guys with one of the girls and the assistant are going to be harder to reach. Any leap will take you into the support beams for the brothel.]</p>
<p>[How many beams?] Mark asked.</p>
<p>[Hard to see,] MuSu said. [Looks like four, each about two and a half meters apart.]</p>
<p>[Don&rsquo;t move,] Mark said. [I&rsquo;ve got an idea.]</p>
<p>Mark pushed himself up to the air, surfacing between Trixi and Binah; Homa was on the other side of Trixi. He looked up to The Johanna&rsquo;s deck where he could see Michael silhouetted against the stars of the night sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A change in plans,&rdquo; he said as loudly as he dared, the dock being only a few hundred meters from where The Johanna lay anchored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Michael asked, leaning over the rail towards the dark water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got everyone, including Malaki, outside, on the dock,&rdquo; Mark explained. &ldquo;They are practically handing this to us. They are apparently going to watch Peter and Len have sex and then drown the girls. So, we&rsquo;re going to go for a surprise attack, and take all the bad guys down at once. As soon as you see us attack, go full speed towards the dock and start picking up women. If we&rsquo;re lucky, no one will be able to fire a shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think there might be more inside?&rdquo; Michael asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conjo said Malaki traveled with five plus his son, and Anjo normally just has two guys on hand,&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a cheap bastard.&rdquo;? &ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;What about the assistant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give the same signal as we planned, and hopefully Peter and the assistant will see it, and hopefully Conjo was able to tell him what to do,&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;We can sort it out later, if not. We&rsquo;re not going to kill anyone, hopefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Mark smiled. &ldquo;Expect something about eight minutes,&rdquo; and he disappeared beneath the surface of the water. Michael stood back up, looked at his watch, and then walked into the cabin. Liz looked up at him, her eyes shining with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the bad guys are outside on the dock,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfect set up. We&rsquo;re going to totally change the plans. As soon as the mers attack the bad guys, you gun the engines and head for the dock as fast as The Johanna will go. When you get close, swing around and I&rsquo;ll start pulling the girls over the stern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Liz said, cinching down the seat belt holding her in the captain&rsquo;s chair, her useless legs folded underneath her. She punched a button and the sound of a winch began. A green light indicated that their anchor was coming up from the seafloor.</p>
<p>Michael returned to the deck and lifted his binoculars to his eyes. He scanned the shoreline until he located the brothel and its dock. He could see half dozen girls of mixed races and ages, clustered together on the middle leg of the dock. Peter and Len stood among them. Four or five larger men stood at regular places along the two outside legs of the dock, and three smaller men and one women stood along the spine of the dock that ran along the maze of support poles and beams that lashed together to support the brothel&rsquo;s seaward wall. He raised his hand, and then lifted his head to make sure that Liz could see him. She nodded at him, and he returned to the binoculars.</p>
<p>Emma Henderson had only her hate to keep her alive. She hated men, and she hated one man in particular. She hated Anjo. She never learned the name of the man who captured and sold her to Anjo, so she simply hated Anjo. She stood on the dock with the other girls and the two strange men, one American and one Australian. She could see Anjo standing next to his boss, a man she supposed that she should also hate, but she didn&rsquo;t really care about him. With Anjo it was personal. She was going to try to kill him before she died, but she didn&rsquo;t know how or when. It didn&rsquo;t matter to her; her hate was enough.</p>
<p>When she had first arrived at the brothel, she half hoped and half feared that her daughters might also be there. For her son, she prayed that he met the same sad fate that her husband had. Death was better than what she suspected was in store for her son. He was young enough that these sick men would exploit him, and the thought of her son sexually servicing these bastards strengthened her hate. These sick men! God, how she hated men!</p>
<p>Of her own experiences, she knew that she ought to be dead. First, she tried to stop her husband from being killed, and while she had been beaten badly, those thugs didn&rsquo;t kill her. Second, when she arrived at Anjo&rsquo;s brothel, some Muslim men who rented her then raped and beat her, and then threw acid on her. Anjo, she could tell, had expected her to die in the experience. It was then she learned the phrase &ldquo;snuff sex.&rdquo; But she didn&rsquo;t die, and the other girls in the brothel nursed her back to health.</p>
<p>She devoted herself to those girls, mothering them, cleaning up after them, smuggling condoms and soap into their rooms so that they might try, as best they could, to protect themselves from the ravages of what amounted to female slavery. She hoped that by doing this it would hurt Anjo in some way. Twice she had even attacked one of Anjo&rsquo;s clients when they had harmed one of her girls, but each time Anjo didn&rsquo;t punish her because the men hadn&rsquo;t paid extra for the privilege of harming his property. Men were both sick and selfish. Sick men. Now, in the darkness illuminated by the glowing windows of the brothel above, one of those sick men, the portly American was trying to get her attention. She turned her hate-filled gaze from Anjo to the American, and raised her scarred and misshapen face to his, ready to unleash her hatred upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can understand English, please nod,&rdquo; the man asked her in a whisper. On reflex she nodded, her anger suddenly quelled by his gentle question and manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this next question you must use all your strength to keep your composure,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;I am actually here to help you, not hurt you. Are you ready for the question??
Emma blinked her eyes. She reexamined the man before her. He was a middle-aged man, a bit portly, but not an evil looking man. He looked like an accountant or lawyer. He seemed to have soft eyes. What was going on? She took a deep breath and nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Emma Henderson?&rdquo; the stranger asked.</p>
<p>Emma nearly cried out but remembered his injunction. She blinked back tears that suddenly sprung to her eyes and nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. You&rsquo;re not going to die, but I need you to sit on the edge of the dock with your legs in the water,&rdquo; the man explained. &ldquo;Can you ask all the other girls to do the same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I trust you?&rdquo; she whispered back to him, speaking English for the first time in months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because your children are on their way to rescue you,&rdquo; the man said with a warm smile.</p>
<p>Emma couldn&rsquo;t help herself as her legs simply gave way and she fell to the dock with a thump. The henchmen laughed at her clumsiness, but Emma quickly composed herself and looked back up at this apparent rescuer. He simply nodded again towards the other girls, acting as though nothing was at all unusual.</p>
<p>Emma sat up straight and ordered them all to sit close to her in the Cebuano language all the girls and their captors used to communicate. One of the Indian girls gave her a sharp look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do they hold Vidya?&rdquo; the girl whispered in English.</p>
<p>Emma shrugged and looked back at the American.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many of you speak English?&rdquo; the strange man asked quietly as the girls started to huddle close together. &ldquo;Please raise one finger carefully if you speak English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the girls raised a finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Len said. &ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;m just as frightened as you are, but if you do as I ask, you will be very pleased with the result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls warily began to sit on the dock next to Emma, and when all were seated, both Peter and Len sat next to them. Peter began taking off his clothes, very slowly and folding them carefully, laying them on the dock beside him. He indicated to the girls that they should join him. When Len started taking off his clothes, the girls all joined in. All the henchmen that surrounded them now began joking about the girls and men who were awkwardly disrobing on the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go slowly,&rdquo; urged Len. &ldquo;Make them watch us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Geeta Basra and her sister Rani sat down on the other side of Emma from the strange American. She glanced over to where they could see their brother and their youngest sister held between two other men. She toyed with the thought of trying to escape by swimming, but she couldn&rsquo;t abandon her sisters or her brother, who was somehow connected to their own abduction, she could now see. Perhaps this American really was going to rescue them. She noticed that both Vidya and Sudhish were silently crying. She stifled her own tears, which would do no good at the present moment.</p>
<p>Geeta looked around at the men who watched them, and she arched her back to thrust her breasts forward as she removed her top. She tried to catch her brother&rsquo;s eye, but he was focused on the water beyond the dock and wasn&rsquo;t looking at her. She looked at her sister, Rani, and thought about how their lives had spiraled down into this living hell.</p>
<p>In only a few months, she and her sisters had gone from upper middle class girls hoping to marry bright, professional young men to basest chattel, captive sex toys for the rich and perverted. She shuddered internally thinking about all the men she had serviced, even as she noticed that her breasts were still attracting the attention of most of the men on the other two docks.</p>
<p>Of all the girls assembled on the dock, Geeta knew that she wouldn&rsquo;t be conceited in acknowledging that she was the most beautiful girl there. Well, if they were going to be rescued, she had better put on a show to keep the bad guys distracted. They were all naked now, and so she raised her arms above her head and shook her shoulders. She smirked at how easy it was to hold male attention as her breasts swayed on her chest.</p>
<p>A sharp slap echoed across the dock as a pair of large red and orange colored flukes smacked the otherwise placid water a few yards from where Geeta was putting on her show. Sudhish saw the strange tail rise and fall, and he tightened his grip on his sister&rsquo;s hand, wrenched his other hand from Torro&rsquo;s grip, and jumped towards the strange tail, pulling his sister awkwardly out of Malaki&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<p>As they both leaped into the water, eleven magnificent creatures suddenly rose up from the bay in unison, one arching up over each of the eight henchmen standing on the two long docks, while three others arched over the leaping Sudhish and Vidya towards Anjo, Malaki, and his son.</p>
<p>Flashes of color filled the night sky as each mer hit their mark, dull thumps echoing as flukes slapped into human bodies, a sharp barb at the top of those flukes piercing torso, shoulder, or leg. The mers hit seven men squarely on their backs, the mer-venom reaching their spines immediately and swiftly paralyzing them. They dropped like stones onto the dock. Two of them even fell into the water where they floated, face down, unmoving. But two of the henchmen only suffered indirect hits, in either their shoulder or leg, and in the seconds before the venom fully paralyzed them, they each drew out their guns and began firing, first at the mers and then at the prostitutes and their Johns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get into the water!&rdquo; Len and Peter urged all the girls, shouting as loudly as they could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swim out into the bay! Towards that boat!&rdquo; He pointed at the still distant Johanna, whose engines were now roaring into action.</p>
<p>The bullets were flying everywhere, and Len and Peter started pushing the shocked women into the water, one by one. Both of them ignored the bullets that whizzed by, but the seconds seemed like hours. A bullet zipped past Len&rsquo;s ear and sploinked into the water near his shoulder. He reflexively dove into the water, resurfaced and tried to get the women to start making their way towards the approaching yacht. &ldquo;Move!&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<p>Mark felt his barb sink into Malaki&rsquo;s flesh as he passed over him, hitting him squarely in the chest. He reached forward with his hands and grabbed one of the beams that supported the brothel above him, and twisted around the pole and flipped back out into the water. He saw Trixi perform a similar maneuver in the corner of his eye, and heard the reassuring splash when she tumbled back into the water next to him. He somersaulted quickly and pushed himself back up onto the dock. There he found Homa putting another dose of mermaid venom into the horizontal Malaki.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the water!&rdquo; he ordered, feeling a bullet whiz by. &ldquo;Take him to the boat,&rdquo; he said, flinging Torro&rsquo;s body into the water. Homa glared at her mate for a second, but when another bullet zinged past, she hopped quickly into the water, and tugged Torro underneath the surface as she went, the orange in her tail flashing in the dark water. Mark grabbed Malaki and threw him to the waiting Binah, who had given the first signal with her tail. Mark then rolled into the water, determined to stop the gunfire. The water filled with the sounds of struggle and panic as he swam towards the far dock.</p>
<p>[Wong and MuSu got the two shooters a second time,] Trixi said to him a few seconds later. [Everyone is now paralyzed.]</p>
<p>[Great,] Mark said back as he pulled a quick u-turn. [Let&rsquo;s get going before more show up.]</p>
<p>[I&rsquo;ll get the Indian boy and his sister,] Trixi shot back and turned towards the spot where Sudhish and Vidya struggled in the water.</p>
<p>[Binah and Homa,] Mark sent out as he sped back towards Trixi. [The shooting has stopped, you can let the bad guys breathe. The Johanna should be nearby. Head for it. Everyone else who can hear me, leave the bad guys where they are, and get to the girls and Len and Peter! Get everyone on The Johanna as quickly as possible!]</p>
<p>Mark pulled up next to Trixi as Sudhish and his sister floundered in the water and rose up beside them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relax!&rdquo; Mark said loudly enough to get their attention. &ldquo;Take off your shoes and start swimming for that boat,&rdquo; he urged, pointing at the fast approaching Johanna. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get out of here quickly before we attract any more attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudhish and Vidya stopped struggling as they felt Trixi and Mark support them in the water. The beauty of the mer&rsquo;s eyes and faces distracted both, and they simply stared at their rescuers. They were jolted out of their reverie by two loud shrieks, one joyful and one horrified. All four, both mer and human, turned and looked towards the jumble of heads, limbs, and tails near the center dock where the MuSu&rsquo;s and Wong&rsquo;s pods had joined the soon-to-be-former-prostitutes and Len and Peter in the water.</p>
<p>An elderly woman with a face horrifically disfigured by scars and burns was screaming the names of her daughters as she hugged three mermaids fiercely. Emma Henderson hadn&rsquo;t quite figured out that she now had three daughters rather than two, but her joyful screams were in dramatic contrast to the horrified wails of Rani Basra as she tried to lift the lifeless head of her sister out of the water. Shen and Lin where supporting Rani and her sister while Esmée and Wong tried to help the other girls maintain their composure. Rani turned the bloody head of Geeta to the side and saw the blood oozing from a small hole in her left temple. She pressed her hand to the wound, and screamed &ldquo;Geeta!&rdquo; over and over again.</p>
<p>Emma finally heard the horrified screams of Rani and stopped her own joyful celebration, breaking away from her daughters to swim towards the stricken Rani.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom,&rdquo; Rikki interrupted. &ldquo;Let the mers handle this, they might be able to help her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mers?&rdquo; Emma said, slowly putting everything together, the flashes of tails, fins, and flukes that she&rsquo;d barely registered when Len had pushed her into the water. &ldquo;As in mermaids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Mom,&rdquo; Rikki said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re mermaids, all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mermaids?&rdquo; Emma repeated. &ldquo;All of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mom,&rdquo; Emma, her daughter, said. &ldquo;Even me &hellip; your son &hellip; it&rsquo;s me, Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin?&rdquo; Emma repeated, and then she promptly fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take her to the boat,&rdquo; Emma said, gathering her into her arms. &ldquo;Start helping the other girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shen, meanwhile, had tried to force her breast to Geeta&rsquo;s lips, but Rani wouldn&rsquo;t release her sister from her grasp. Lin pressed her fingers into Geeta&rsquo;s artery, and after a second or two, she shook her head at her sister. Shen sagged, understanding that they could do nothing to save the unfortunate young woman. She glanced over to Mark and shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noooooooooooooooo!&rdquo; Sudhish screamed, realizing what had happened. &ldquo;No, no, no, noooooooooooooo.&rdquo; He struck out for his dead sister, but Mark grabbed him and shook him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to go,&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Sudhish argued as he struggled to free himself. &ldquo;I have to save Geeta!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mark said, holding him firmly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead. And if we delay longer, you risk the lives of your remaining sisters and everyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudhish blinked, and looked around. He could see the paralyzed bodies of most of the henchmen, Anjo and his thugs, but not his boss or Torro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malaki and his son are being taken to the boat,&rdquo; Mark said in response to Sudhish&rsquo;s unasked question. &ldquo;We will handle them later. First, let us help you. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must kill those men,&rdquo; Sudhish said, feeling anger erupt in his chest. &ldquo;They killed my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not kill unless we must,&rdquo; Mark said firmly. &ldquo;Go, save your remaining sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudhish blinked again, and nodded unconsciously, not realizing he was agreeing with the merman who held his shirt so that he didn&rsquo;t sink. He shook his head, and nodded again, consciously and turned to his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just lie on your back with your face to the air,&rdquo; Trixi said to both Sudhish and Vidya. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the rest.&rdquo; She sank beneath Vidya, supporting her, and began to swim for the boat.</p>
<p>The Johanna thundered up to the dock, turned hard to port, swinging the stern towards the swimmers struggling towards her, some on their own, some dragged or pushed by a mer. Michael knelt on the aft swimming platform, reaching out to the swimmers who were still several meters away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the engines,&rdquo; he shouted up to Liz, who had already cut the throttle.</p>
<p>After the engines grew silent, he started pulling the swimmers up as they arrived. The mers who had been helping and guiding them now forming a channel to guide the remaining swimmers. Emma regained consciousness as she was being handed up to Michael, and she scrambled into a corner of the main deck and hugged her knees. Peter and Len were the last to clamber up onto the deck, the five remaining girls clustered around the still shocked Emma in fear and amazement. Peter and Len turned around, still naked, and stood next to Michael facing the mers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;Send them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark, Wong, and MuSu took Torro from Binah and flung his body towards the men on the swimming deck. Torro&rsquo;s limp body looked like a rag doll as he landed at their feet, his head thumping against Michael&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that hurt,&rdquo; Len said as he reached down to lift Torro up onto the main deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He meant Torro, not you,&rdquo; Peter explained, looking at Michael.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what he meant,&rdquo; Michael smiled at both men as they hoisted Torro up over the aft rail. Torro&rsquo;s head thumped again as they let him fall to the deck behind them. The three men shared a satisfied smile, and then turned back to the water. The mers casually tossed up Malaki in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The venom should last for a few hours,&rdquo; Mark said, as Peter and Len clambered up onto the main deck after they tossed Malaki.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move out and further down the bay, and we&rsquo;ll give them another dose. Hopefully, it&rsquo;s dark enough that few people noticed us,&rdquo; he finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shooting didn&rsquo;t help,&rdquo; Michael said as he hopped up onto the main deck. &ldquo;But this is a section of town were guns aren&rsquo;t unusual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so,&rdquo; Mark agreed. He glanced around at the mers, and in unison all of them flipped back under the water.</p>
<p>The lack of moonlight left the Moon Pool in inky blackness, but the mers in the pool were seeing one another with their mer-senses, not their eyes. Their world was sparkling with delicate lines of energy, dancing among and between them, and each mer was a soft, mer-shaped blob of glowing energy. The new mers still marveled at how impoverished their human senses had been. Everyone had just returned to the caves after the hearing amazing report of the rescue in Davao, and the pods settled in for the night.</p>
<p>[Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m sure that they are fine,] Pat said with as little exasperation as she could manage. She felt backwards with her mer-senses checking in on her own pod, and could sense Maureen fussing.</p>
<p>[But they didn&rsquo;t check in earlier today,] Jaclyn said, looking at her pod-mates for support.</p>
<p>[They weren&rsquo;t supposed to check in until the day after they set The Device, which may or may not have been today,] Pat argued. [We tried to contact them, after we were done with Trixi. You were there! What else do you want me to do?]</p>
<p>[Pat?] Danni interrupted.</p>
<p>[Bring her over, dear] Pat answered.</p>
<p>[Try it again,] Jaclyn said.</p>
<p>[CHEW doesn&rsquo;t work like a radio,] Pat tried to explain patiently. [They have to be similarly arranged and ready to receive long distance CHEW or we will just be wasting our energy. They obviously haven&rsquo;t yet finishing setting The Device. We&rsquo;ll try again tomorrow morning, at the time we&rsquo;re supposed to, and hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to contact Trevor&rsquo;s pod.]</p>
<p>[I just wish we could have gone with them,] Janice said, pouting.</p>
<p>[We would have been more of a burden to them,] Jaclyn said, putting a soothing hand on Janice&rsquo;s shoulder. [We barely stay out of trouble here, and we&rsquo;re learning as fast as we can about life as a mer.]</p>
<p>[You&rsquo;ll be able to go with them next time,] Pat said, as she gathered the fussing baby mermaid from Danni&rsquo;s arms. [You guys are still newbies, sort of like this one, and there&rsquo;s a lot to learn about being a mer, not the least of which is what is edible and what&rsquo;s not. You will learn quickly, but it still takes time.]</p>
<p>[I suppose you&rsquo;re right,] said Janice, a touch of fatigue in her CHEW. [There&rsquo;s still so much we have to do here before all hell breaks loose.]</p>
<p>[We&rsquo;re going to be fine,] Pat said, as she guided Maureen to her breast. The little mermaid quieted immediately and began to feed. [That&rsquo;s it, little one. Good girl. We cannot keep the secret of our existence for much longer, especially with all the witnesses, criminal though they may be, in Davao. But I don&rsquo;t think all hell will break loose, we&rsquo;re not powerless.]</p>
<p>[I just worry,] Jaclyn. [This being a mother thingy is still new to me.]</p>
<p>[You&rsquo;re not a mother yet, my dear,] Pat said gently. [And I&rsquo;m just the former man who can tell you that.]</p>
<p>[Yeah, I can see that you are,] Jaclyn agreed. [Someday I will actually be one, but not soon.]</p>
<p>[Maybe you&rsquo;ll be a grandmother before you get to be a mother,] Janice said teasingly. [Wouldn&rsquo;t that be amazing.]</p>
<p>[It would be miraculous,] Jaclyn said.</p>
<p>The Johanna drifted in the open sea, about 150 miles east of Davao City. In the time it had taken them to clear out of Davao Bay, Michael and crew had learned something of the lives of these women before their rescue. Geeta Basra had been kidnapped about three months ago and her sisters were taken a few weeks later, whereas Emma had been captive for nearly eighteen months.</p>
<p>Len and Peter had picked the two other girls because they looked so young. Maja, a Filipino girl, was only sixteen years old, though held captive for nearly two years. Antonia, a New Zealander, was eighteen years old, and she had been a captive for over three years. Both girls proved surprisingly resilient, however, and seemed much less worse for wear than Emma or the Basra sisters. Given that all the girls felt &ldquo;ruined&rdquo; by their work in the brothel, all of them had shared their contempt for returning to a civilization that had not only failed to rescue them but also had likely given them up for dead.</p>
<p>They had stopped here, briefly, so that the mers could report back to Mermaid Island and donate some more venom to be used on Malaki and his son. MuSu&rsquo;s pod donated most of the venom because mers had to do that out of the water, and his pod spent most of their time talking to Emma as they milked their own barbs, trying to cram the news of over a year and a half of their lives into fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>The triplets proved both effective storytellers and venom providers, and everyone learned a lot in that brief period. The girls had wanted to heal their mother, but MuSu and the others persuaded them to wait because it would take time and organization to sort out who would be with whom, and if Emma had mermaid milk in her body, she might have to bond to one of the men on board. Emma had been adamant that she would not bond to any man. No one disagreed with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can make Palau by later this afternoon,&rdquo; Michael said, his feet trailing in the water as he sat on the swimming deck, talking to the mers. They still were difficult to see in the pre-dawn dusk, the sky to the east just barely showing the glimmers of a new day. &ldquo;From there it&rsquo;s about four or five days, depending on wind and weather, to Mermaid Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s meet you later tonight about 300 miles east by southeast from Palau,&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;You probably don&rsquo;t need to keep Malaki and his son paralyzed, but if you keep putting a little bit in the water they drink, they&rsquo;ll be too weak to give you much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Michael said with some sympathy, &ldquo;I think they have more to fear from Emma, Sudhish, and his sisters than we have to fear from them. It&rsquo;s amazing how quickly most strong men become weak once their hired muscle is taken away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not surprising to me,&rdquo; Mark laughed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times that has proven true. Alright, see you in fourteen hours. MuSu,&rdquo; Mark called out loudly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time. We have to get going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MuSu&rsquo;s head popped up from the main deck. &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; he answered. Mark could hear the sounds of kisses, gentle sobs, and hugs as the Henderson girls said goodbye to their mother. A few seconds later MuSu&rsquo;s pod launched themselves over the side railing and arched towards the dark ocean in graceful dives, each one slicing silently into the water after the other. They quickly appeared behind Mark&rsquo;s pod, bobbing with the others.</p>
<p>Michael stood up and watched as the mers received some signal from Mark and then moved in perfect unison to disappear beneath the waves. He paused to wonder how they did that and what it would be like to be part of such a group. Soon enough, he thought to himself. He turned and saw the early morning sun just breaking through the far horizon, the day looking like it would be calm and beautiful. Michael turned back towards the main cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; he said as he clambered over the aft rail. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take first shift at the helm and Liz can keep you company. Len and I will get some shut eye in the starboard cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He surveyed the five women still clustering around Emma on the floor of the main deck, each of them now clad in one of his tee shirts that functioned, more or less, like a summer pullover on the smaller women. Sudhish was also among that group, still surrounded by his two remaining sisters, and he was wearing one of Peter&rsquo;s swim trunks. Len and Peter, like himself, had returned to their customary swim trunks and tee shirt. Everyone looked tired, Michael knew he needed a few hours of sleep or he would become useless, and then the rescue effort would have been for naught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Malaki and his son in the port cabin, I think four of you could sleep in the main stateroom forward,&rdquo; Michael suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a master suite, and the bed could fit four comfortably. Two others could sleep in the starboard cabin. Everyone ought to try for a few hours rest. We have a long journey ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maja and I can take the galley,&rdquo; Antonia said, rising and helping Maja to her feet. &ldquo;Those are beds aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;? &ldquo;Yes, but Len and I can take those!&rdquo; Michael protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Antonia insisted. &ldquo;You need your rest, and you&rsquo;ve done more than enough for us.&rdquo; They both turned and descended the gangway towards the galley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll share the cabin,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Len. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one with a single, full-sized bed, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; said Len with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Emma urged the Basras. &ldquo;You need some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Sudhish sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not sleeping will not make her come back,&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;You have to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Sudhish repeated, softly.</p>
<p>Rani looked at Emma and then at Vidya, and the three of them stood up and then pulled Sudhish to his feet. They gently guided the sobbing young man towards the forward stateroom. Emma held back for a moment and turned back to others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, her eyes shining with emotion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d given up hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank your daughters,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;They were sure they&rsquo;d find you, and find you they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughters,&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;I still &hellip; they all &hellip; I don&rsquo;t &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it time,&rdquo; Liz said from her chair. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all headed into an uncertain future. I&rsquo;m sure you and your daughters will figure out how everything will best fit together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard Sudhish sob as his sisters tried to get him to lie down on the bed. &ldquo;No, the floor is all I deserve,&rdquo; he wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in for a rough time,&rdquo; Peter said. &ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t take all the blame upon himself like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cultural,&rdquo; Len said. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll pull through. There&rsquo;s something about those kids that makes me think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure he&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;I know how he feels.&rdquo; She turned and entered the forward cabin and shut the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman is amazing,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I could have survived through what she has gone. Come on, let&rsquo;s get some shut eye. You two gonna be able to handle things for a few hours?&rdquo; He nodded to Peter, and the bronzed elderly chemist saluted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be fine,&rdquo; said Liz, as she maneuvered her wheelchair next to Peter. &ldquo;Go sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you in a few hours,&rdquo; Michael said, and turned and headed for the gangway and the starboard cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two kids, Maja and Antonia, they are very brave. I&rsquo;m glad we picked them,&rdquo; Len said. &ldquo;I only wish we could have saved more of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time,&rdquo; Liz said. &ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll make a nation of mers from the downtrodden, enslaved, and outcast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, for an heiress, you often surprise me,&rdquo; Len said as he turned to follow Michael below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a lawyer, you always surprise me,&rdquo; Liz said, her eyes laughing.</p>
<p>The mers found a school of orange roughy and alfonsino swimming halfway down a sea ridge and stopped for a much-needed breakfast. Trixi still had to steel herself to take the first bite into a still squirming fish, but her hunger and her mer-senses compelled her to tear into the flesh of the alfonsino still squirming in her hands. She looked over to Homa and Binah effortlessly and ruthlessly enjoying their meal, bits of fish floating in the water near their faces. Once she pulled the scaly skin away from the flanks of the fish, the sweet, soft flesh tasted like tangy butter in her mouth. Sushi was better when it was off the bone, she thought. It was getting it off the bone that she didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p>She noticed Mark finish his own breakfast and look over to her. Her heart thumped a little bit harder as he swam up to her, his beautiful black and purple tail flashing in the pale light of the sun still visible at fifteen meters. She still marveled at how much her life had changed. Only a short time ago, she was a transsexual prostitute, and now she was a genetic female, a genetic mermaid, actually, but female finally! She felt a bit of scale caught in between two of her teeth and quickly spit it out.</p>
<p>[Still not your thing, eh?] He said.</p>
<p>[You&rsquo;re my thing,] Trixi said, letting the last of the fish float away and feeling her heart surge when he put his arm around her.</p>
<p>[You did good,] Mark said, giving her a kiss. [Torro went down like a rock.]</p>
<p>[I had a great teacher,] Trixi said. [The best.]</p>
<p>[You have natural instincts,] Mark said, pulling her in close.</p>
<p>[I love natural instincts,] Trixi said, as she pressed herself into her pod-mate.</p>
<p>[Perhaps we should explore some of them,] Mark suggested, nipping at her neck.</p>
<p>[We swim faster than that boat, right?] Trixi said, swooning at his love bites and loving how her own soft curves were pressing into Mark&rsquo;s chiseled male body.</p>
<p>[If we want to,] he said, moving his hands along the narrow of her waist, teasing the edge of her tail and torso.</p>
<p>[Then we have some time here for some natural instincts?] She asked in her most innocent voice.</p>
<p>[I say yes to natural instincts,] Homa said, pressing her own body up against theirs.</p>
<p>[Me too,] Binah agreed as she finished off her roughy and joined them.</p>
<p>[I live to make my mermaids happy,] Mark said, tugging on his vent flap and freeing his rapidly telescoping cock.</p>
<p>Trixi turned her wide hips towards his, and felt Homa and Binah position themselves on either side. She put her arms around Mark&rsquo;s neck and let him guide her hips towards his, his strong hands firmly grasping the slopes of her waist just above her pelvic bone. Homa&rsquo;s tail wound around hers, and Trixi felt the fringes of Homa&rsquo;s flukes vibrate against her lower tail, just above her root, where her ankles used to be. Binah&rsquo;s tail fluttered against theirs as she pressed herself into Mark&rsquo;s other pelvic fin, her dark breasts beginning to leak white, mermaid milk into the water.</p>
<p>[I&rsquo;m so happy I got rescued,] Trixi said as Mark&rsquo;s cock eased into her.</p>
<p>[Me too,] Homa said, her hips twitching as Mark&rsquo;s fin vibrated in her vent.</p>
<p>[Yeeessssssssssssss,] Binah said, her orgasm overtaking her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did good, Len,&rdquo; Michael said as he lay down on the full sized bed in the small, cramped cabin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Len blushed at the praise, and wondered again at the journey he was undertaking. He looked over at Michael who was smiling at him with what looked like genuine affection and pride. He felt really good, and he didn&rsquo;t feel that way often. The upwelling of gratitude and affection still seemed strange to him, even more so because another man was causing him to feel this way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be embarrassed,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;You should feel good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I DO feel good,&rdquo; Len said, looking away. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m embarrassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Michael said, understanding. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Len said, sitting down on the other edge of the bed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry. This will all just take &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time,&rdquo; said Michael, rolling onto his back and putting his hands beneath his head. &ldquo;And a little mermaid milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Len agreed, turning onto his back and lying down next to Michael. &ldquo;A lot of mermaid milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lay in silence for a moment. Len felt the oddness press heavily on his chest, even as his penis betrayed some of his conflicting feelings. He turned away from Michael onto his side and tucked his stiffening penis back between his legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you thought about it much?&rdquo; Michael asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all the time, it seems,&rdquo; Len answered, not moving, but conscious of the fact that he was holding his legs together as if they were already forming a tail. He deliberately bent one knee forward, over the other. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s gotten worse since we actually met the mers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about it?&rdquo; Michael said after a moment of silence. There was no reply from Len. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to answer if you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Len said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just thinking. Liz and I talked about it a while ago, but it&rsquo;s become so much more &hellip; more &hellip; real in the last two days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me about the book,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s adorable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I guess,&rdquo; said Len, feeling even more embarrassed. A few more moments passed in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this will be easier once we start the process of transformation,&rdquo; Len said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really comfortable with the whole &hellip; two men, thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Michael said lightly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of the two men thing, think about the mermaid you&rsquo;d like to become.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; Len said. &ldquo;Kelly Brook. You probably think that&rsquo;s silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but that was a terrible movie,&rdquo; Michael said laughing. &ldquo;I do like your taste in mermaids; she was beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I could never bear to see the movie. I heard it was so bad, but she looked stunning in the pictures I saw.&rdquo; Len said. &ldquo;I think it will be easier when I&rsquo;m more like her and less like &hellip; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will like that,&rdquo; Michael said, his own cock twitching to life as he remembered that terrible movie, Fishtales or something like that. &ldquo;It will be strange having someone who will look like Kelly Brook but will sound as intelligent, wise, and funny as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure on the wisdom,&rdquo; Len answered. &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;m about to throw away everything I&rsquo;ve ever been, ever wanted to be, so that I can become a mermaid. It sounds most unwise when I say it out loud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw them,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;Do you really think the decision is unwise? Their beauty, their power, their eyes &hellip; they are just so &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Len, feeling his penis stiffen further. &ldquo;It seems too wonderful to be true, which is one reason why I hope it&rsquo;s not foolish to do what we&rsquo;re about to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to do anything tonight, so get some sleep,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need it. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll wait until you&rsquo;re more like Kelly and less like Leonard before much else happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Len answered, gratified that Michael had put that issue to rest for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about your new name?&rdquo; Michael asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that, I&rsquo;ll have to think about it,&rdquo; Len answered.</p>
<p>Jackson wandered down to the viewing area about an hour after Mac had started his transition. By that time the energy in the tank had built considerably. Mac and Joy were spinning near the center of the tank, a few meters back from the glass wall that separated the tank from the rest of the room. The fish in the tank were still swimming in a large circle, in the same direction as the spinning couple. Below the spinning humans, a dark brown cuttlefish swayed lifelessly in the water, looking either stunned or dead, no one was sure.</p>
<p>The tiny bubbles that had appeared on both Mac and Joy over the last few days now appeared to be erupting from Mac&rsquo;s skin all over his body. While the people observing had no point of comparison, the bubbles were about half as thick as the ones that had surrounded Jaclyn and Janice a few days previously in the Moon Pool. Mac was still easily visible behind the sheen and sparkle of the rising air bubbles. During the night, Annette had seen a vortex of bubbles spin down, like a minitornado, and spin the lifeless cuttlefish like a top. She hoped it wasn&rsquo;t an omen.</p>
<p>At first, they saw little change in Mac, but over the course of the next twenty-four hours, the changes became more visible. Brent, Annette, Jack, and Kyle had taken turns watching over the tank as the day turned into night and then back into day. Early in the previous evening, the separation between Mac&rsquo;s legs was no longer visible, and by the evening, they could clearly see the nubs of flukes and fins emerge along the tail, now nearly two meters long.</p>
<p>As the morning sun began to leak into the room from the skylights in the shed above, they could see that Mac&rsquo;s tail was nearly complete, but that wasn&rsquo;t the most dramatic change. His overall coloring had changed, every inch of his skin had changed, not just his new tail. His entire body, from the top of his forehead to the bottom of his flukes, was a near uniform, light mocha brown. Joy was still pale and white, her hand resting on his now dark torso. His hair was still dark brown, as it had been before, though now it hung, as with all the other mers, down past his shoulders in thick, slightly curling waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think has happened?&rdquo; Jackson asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea,&rdquo; Annette answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just going to have to wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few more moments passed, then a terrific spasm gripped Mac&rsquo;s body, and his brown tail flashed with energy as it arced above his head. Multicolored bioluminescence sparkled along his fringes. Joy stopped humming, her hand flying from Mac&rsquo;s side as though she had been shocked. Mac seemed paralyzed in a circular position, his arms now stretched out over his head nearly touching his flukes. His eyes snapped open, and then his entire body shimmered and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell!?&rdquo; snapped Brent as he stood quickly and rushed over to the tank. &ldquo;Where did he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joy appeared to be confused as well, and Brent rapped on the glass, which startled all the fish in the tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Jackson said, joining him at the tank.</p>
<p>Joy looked at the worried expressions of everyone outside the tank, and then back at Mac, who had relaxed in the water. She shook her head and realized that she was sensing Mac with her proto-mer senses and not really seeing him at all. In fact, when she blinked her eyes, she realized that she could barely see him at all. Only his eyes, which were facing her, were the only features clearly visible to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening, Mac?&rdquo; she asked, bubbles rising from her mouth.</p>
<p>Mac felt the grip of the final paralysis of his transformation ebb from his body. He had been conscious the entire time, over twenty-six hours, but he had been unable to move or communicate with Joy. More importantly, he hadn&rsquo;t been able to focus on his own change; he had been a helpless passenger as the siren cells and parasites reshaped his body. There was something deeply disturbing about his helplessness, but his long military training had kicked in, and he focused simply on feeling his heartbeat, and the sensations of his gills fluttering in the water. It wasn&rsquo;t quite like breathing, but there were enough similarities that it allowed him to remain sane.</p>
<p>There had been some pain as his bones reshaped, and the feelings of compression along his ankles and feet were still a vivid memory. He wished he had been able to look down, but his body was caught in a seizure from which he couldn&rsquo;t break free. Now, his body was overwhelming him with new sensations and feelings. He could sense energy around him, which he supposed were his now fully functional mer-organs sending his brain information. He could feel the pressure of the water over his tail, along his fins and flukes. His fins and flukes felt different from his legs, and the sensation of &ldquo;legs&rdquo; had totally disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac, can you hear me?&rdquo; he heard Joy ask him.</p>
<p>He turned his attention outward and looked out at the humans standing outside the tank, and then at his lover floating nearby, and then down at his tail. His brow furrowed, as he realized that while he could &ldquo;see&rdquo; his tail, that his tail was doing something rather extraordinary. He raised a hand before his face, and he waved it back and forth. He flipped it back and forth, palm out, palm in, several times. He watched as the latent image of whatever was behind him melted into what was in front of him along the surface of his skin. He tried it with his other hand, and then he tried to stop it from happening. Nothing changed. His own brain, he noticed, was filtering out the camouflage, and he could clearly see his own flesh. But he could also see that his skin had become like a television screen, and he felt slight sensations of movement along his skin as the images his skin was producing shifted and changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac?&rdquo; Joy repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Mac said, bubbles incongruously appearing out of a mouth that suddenly appeared below his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry, but I feel fine. This is cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you invisible?&rdquo; Joy asked, her voice tinged with awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; answered Mac. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m camouflaged. My skin is reflecting or reproducing or something &hellip; whatever is on the other side of me, like a television screen, but I&rsquo;m not doing this consciously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the cuttlefish,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;The parasites must have done something, changing you in this way. I tried to focus on you, but I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s O.K.; it&rsquo;s not your fault,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;I feel fine, really. But I can&rsquo;t seem to turn it off. Can you see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can still see you,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m being helped by my proto-mersenses, I think. Let&rsquo;s check in with them,&rdquo; she finished with a kick towards the surface.</p>
<p>Mac puzzled for a moment, wondering what he needed to &ldquo;do,&rdquo; and so he stretched his &ldquo;toes&rdquo; and watched as his flukes stiffened and spread. He &ldquo;bent&rdquo; his knees, and felt a very different reaction in his tail. He rolled his torso and hips into what he hoped was a stroke of his tail and unexpectedly discovered the full power of his new tail. He rose up too quickly and breached, his hips and pelvic fins rising into the air. When he broke the surface of the water, he could feel the air hit his skin like a slap across the face. He winced, and felt his face and the rest of his body react to the air. It felt like a layer of skin ripped up from his entire body, but without pain, sort of like after he had been sunburned as a child, and the tan peeled off. He fell back into the water and felt the strangeness disappear, and he sensed a commotion outside the tank. He gave a more gentle kick with his tail, and rose to the edge of the tank, now more under control. He felt the same &ldquo;unsealing&rdquo; sensation when his face broke the surface of the water. He also noticed that his hair did not immediately become dry, and he could feel the water drip from his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hydrophobic,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;Like the other mers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can see you!&rdquo; Annette said, her eyes sweeping over the entire form of Mac as he hung from the side of the tank. &ldquo;When you broke the surface of the water, your entire body flashed into view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac nodded and let go of the tank wall and sank again, immediately disappearing as soon as he was completely submerged. He surveyed his now photosensitive skin and marveled at how his body was refracting and polarizing the light from surfaces near him. He rose back to the surface, and it shut off dramatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your skin cells are now chromatophores,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;You must have picked it up from the cuttlefish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infected, more likely,&rdquo; Kyle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chromotaphores?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cells that can manipulate light,&rdquo; Jackson explained. &ldquo;Some mammals have them, but they don&rsquo;t normally possess advanced chromatophores. Cephalopods and reptiles do. Those siren cells must be incredibly powerful to create that strong of a transgenic effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think air affects it?&rdquo; Joy asked looking at Mac&rsquo;s otherwise normal looking skin in the air. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look like a reptile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a cuttlefish, thank goodness,&rdquo; Mac said, grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to guess,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;This whole thing is a bit out of my league.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then guess,&rdquo; Joy said, looking down at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normally metachrosis,&rdquo; he began, stopping himself as he saw the arched eyebrows and cocked heads. &ldquo;Um, the chromatic camouflage you&rsquo;re apparently doing&ndash;metachrosis&ndash;bending the light to disguise yourself, is normally either a physiological mechanism, like in cuttlefish or octopus, they use a muscle to trigger the camouflage, or a chemical or hormonal one, like a chameleon, which is why they change so slowly. Muscles are quicker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not moving any muscles,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;At least none that I know about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might discover them later, but if yours turns out to be involuntary, like the chameleon, but fast, like the cuttlefish, then my best guess is that the camouflage is triggered electrochemically, facilitated by the slight conductivity of seawater,&rdquo; Jackson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, simply being in seawater makes me metachrosize?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s a proper form of that word,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;But sure, that seems to be as good an explanation as possible without further experimentation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is experimenting on me today,&rdquo; Mac said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like your guess,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;From what I remember in my lessons in Mer anatomy, we have organs that generate considerable bio-electric energy, some of which could certainly be harnessed to make chromatophores bend light. Because Mac&rsquo;s skin doesn&rsquo;t seem to be hydrophobic, like the other mers, an electro-chemical switch for metachrosis could help explain why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the brown skin?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neutral color state for the chromatophores,&rdquo; Jackson said with a nod towards the back of the tank. &ldquo;Just like the cuttlefish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes sense,&rdquo; Mac said, feeling his own fingers as he rubbed them together. &ldquo;I feel different, but not too different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I touch you?&rdquo; Kyle asked, speaking for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Mac answered. &ldquo;Grab that ladder over there and grab a feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kyle retrieved the stepladder from the corner and opened it up next to the glass wall where Mac was perched. He carefully ascended the ladder and tentatively put a hand on Mac&rsquo;s shoulder. He ran his fingers along the shoulder down to where the water lapped at Mac&rsquo;s upper forearm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feels more human to me,&rdquo; Kyle said. &ldquo;Not like a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac rubbed his own hand along the same skin, feeling both the relative smoothness, given how youthful he had become, and the &ldquo;normalcy&rdquo; of what he supposed or remembered was human skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; said Mac in the same laconic tones. &ldquo;It feels human to me too, though perhaps a bit like a dolphin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yup,&rdquo; agreed Kyle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d agree with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those scales on your tail?&rdquo; Annette asked, pointing as she looked. &ldquo;There are several different textures, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the depth and layers like scales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mers didn&rsquo;t have scales, per se,&rdquo; Joy explained, glancing down at Mac&rsquo;s tail as he curled it up between them. &ldquo;But the coloring and patterns of their skin look scale-like from their waist down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does feel different,&rdquo; Mac said as he reached down and ran his hands along his waist. &ldquo;A slight difference in texture between my torso and my tail,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mer skin is more like dolphin skin than fish scales, but the tail has a different texture. But since mer skin is normally hydrophobic, we&rsquo;re obviously going to be a different variety of mer. This will probably mean that we can&rsquo;t swim as fast as the other mers,&rdquo; Joy concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;No one will be able to see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ocean,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;There will always be some predator that can see or sense you, sharks will detect your presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can handle a shark,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s humans that have me worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re not human any more, eh?&rdquo; Joy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;But as long as you think I&rsquo;m handsome, I don&rsquo;t care what I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re amazing,&rdquo; Joy said as she kissed him. &ldquo;Are you sure that everything else feels alright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac made to steal another kiss from Joy, but she waved him away and pointed to the rest of the tank. Mac reluctantly let go of the side of the tank and slid back into the water, disappearing before the human eyes. He stretched forward, backward, and side to side, and felt for the first time, his flukes and fins, running his hands along the fringes that trailed from those appendages. He gave a quick swim around the tank, and the humans could see where he was as the other fish reacted to his displacement of water as he swam by. He popped back into view next to Joy as he surfaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel great, and the fish can&rsquo;t see me either,&rdquo; Mac said with a smile. &ldquo;This will make hunting easier. Speaking of which, I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe how fast the metachrosis happens,&rdquo; Jack said, his voice tinged with amazement. &ldquo;Normally it takes a second or two to change each look, but when you swam around the tank, it was nearly instantaneous. It really was like you were invisible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could tell that the fish couldn&rsquo;t see me,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;It was really weird, because I was actually trying to startle them, but some of them only reacted when they accidentally brushed up against me. I almost reached out and ate one, because I&rsquo;m so hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Joy said with a smile. &ldquo;As long as you don&rsquo;t feel any other ill effects, I think I can live with being brown in the air and invisible in the water. In fact, I can&rsquo;t think of anything more perfect for a bunch of former spies,&rdquo; she nodded at Brent and Annette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a certain karmic justice here,&rdquo; Annette agreed. &ldquo;Are you sure that you feel alright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would we do if he doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Joy asked. &ldquo;Would we leave him the only camo-mer in existence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I meant,&rdquo; Annette protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised by this development, but I&rsquo;m no longer human, brown or not. I&rsquo;d rather not be the only one who is like this for very long. However, I don&rsquo;t want anyone else to join me without fully understanding what he or she is in for. Let&rsquo;s just wait a day before we do you,&rdquo; he said nodding at Joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand being cooped up here another second!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you could be trapped in something worse after you change,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;After I eat, let&rsquo;s just run some tests, like hoisting me out of the water to see if the burning still happens. I don&rsquo;t want you or Annette or Brent to be trapped into an existence we didn&rsquo;t otherwise promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not waiting twenty-four hours, Mac,&rdquo; said Joy with a tone that Mac remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least wait until we know if I can tolerate being in the air for any length of time,&rdquo; Mac said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t matter to me what our circumstance will be,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m joining you today. Period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;Just get me some food, a few tests, and then you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to change too,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t matter to us either. One way or the other, we&rsquo;re not going back to our old lives. A new life, with new capabilities, and the possibility of creating new life &hellip; that&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo; Brent gave her a nod, and they both looked coolly back at Mac and Joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m so glad my logic and reasoning made such a big difference,&rdquo; Mac said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, do you want change?&rdquo; Joy asked, deflecting attention towards Kyle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Kyle asked. &ldquo;You asking me if I want to be a mer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;Provided that this particular species of mer isn&rsquo;t too unattractive,&rdquo; she continued, jerking her thumb at Mac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he looks alright,&rdquo; Kyle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks a bit hungry,&rdquo; Mac said grumpily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Jackson explain to you what becoming a mer might mean?&rdquo; Joy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yup,&rdquo; Kyle said. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re two men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are we,&rdquo; Brent said, with a shrug for Annette. &ldquo;Well, we WERE two men. He&rsquo;s now a merman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a hungry merman,&rdquo; Mac said with a tinge of anger in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not going to be a merman?&rdquo; asked Kyle, looking down at Brent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the plan,&rdquo; Brent said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be a mermaid,&rdquo; Annette said, possessively putting her arm around her husband. &ldquo;Like me, and we&rsquo;ll still be mates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mates with me too,&rdquo; Joy said.</p>
<p>Kyle looked from Mac, to Joy, to Annette, to Brent, to Jack. He shuddered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think such an arrangement could work for Jack and I,&rdquo; he said, stepping down from the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you need to scare up six women who you could trust to join you,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;Three each. Maybe one of those women you find could get me some food since no one here cares to help a guy out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we stay?&rdquo; Jackson asked. &ldquo;I mean, this has been our home and such for a long time. We could start our own colony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one of the busiest waterways in the world?&rdquo; challenged Mac. &ldquo;And so close to Washington, DC? In less than a week you&rsquo;d be an experiment at Bethesda Naval or someplace Langley keeps secret even from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s that, I suppose,&rdquo; Jackson nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d think we&rsquo;d need to leave,&rdquo; Kyle said. &ldquo;If we changed, too much trouble to be had hanging around, people thinking how crazy Jack Baker turned himself into one of his own creatures and such. Besides, no cuttlefish in the Chesapeake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I eat the cuttlefish?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; Jackson started. &ldquo;Say, Kyle &hellip; what do you think of my cousin Annie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right enough,&rdquo; Kyle answered. &ldquo;I was thinking we&rsquo;d see about my niece Angela. She loves the sea and the environment, and such. Her father&rsquo;s a bit of an asshole, and so she might be happy about changing things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough,&rdquo; Jackson agreed. &ldquo;But that still leaves four more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we do with just two?&rdquo; Kyle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mermen become uncontrollably competitive if there isn&rsquo;t at least one of their own mates present,&rdquo; Joy said, putting a hand on Mac&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;If you had only one, and something happened &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that would be a problem?&rdquo; Kyle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A big problem,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;I can feel it now, with three of you in the room. It&rsquo;s just a little twinge, but there&rsquo;s something about all you unmated men that makes my heart race. Almost as much as my hunger makes me grumpy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Kyle said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need to find some volunteers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should recruit skills and expertise,&rdquo; Jack said, looking at Brent, Annette and Joy. &ldquo;People who can help the mer society grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;re talking!&rdquo; Annette said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking here!&rdquo; Mac thundered, startling everyone. &ldquo;Good God! What does a merman have to do around here to get some food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, sorry,&rdquo; Jackson said and headed back into the storage room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you,&rdquo; Mac asked Joy. &ldquo;Hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could do with a bit of food,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m hungrier for the change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon enough,&rdquo; Mac said, smiling. &ldquo;Food first, a few quick tests, and then you change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Everything is set, all systems secure?] Pat asked, the pods arranged behind her, boosting her CHEW.</p>
<p>[Yep!] Rose answered, her CHEW stronger over distances than any other mer, probably because she had invented and made all the tiaras that made CHEW communication possible. [The Device is set, secure, and probably won&rsquo;t ever open now.]</p>
<p>[So, making love at 1000 meters is something special?] Pat asked.</p>
<p>[I guess you could say that,] Rose said.</p>
<p>[How soon can we expect you back?] Pat asked.</p>
<p>[We&rsquo;re going to start the mapping and reconnaissance work today, so we ought to be back in about a week,] Rose answered. [We&rsquo;re going to explore and have some fun.]</p>
<p>[Your moms were worried about you and wanted to know how you&rsquo;re doing,] Pat said.</p>
<p>[When everyone is boosting CHEW, everyone can hear the conversation, right?] Rose asked.</p>
<p>[Yes,] Pat said, hearing something playful in Rose&rsquo;s CHEW. [What&rsquo;s up, you have something to tell us, girl?]</p>
<p>[Oh, nothing,] Rose said. [We&rsquo;ll check in tomorrow morning, as ordered, kay?]</p>
<p>[Alright, you scamp,] Pat said. [You&rsquo;ll tell us the news upon your return, right?]</p>
<p>[What news?] Rose demanded. [How do you know these things? God, we&rsquo;re hundreds of miles away, but it was like you were watching or something.]</p>
<p>[When you become a parent, you see and hear things from children differently,] Pat said.</p>
<p>[Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll find out shortly then, won&rsquo;t I?] Rose said. [Talk to you tomorrow!] Her signal faded.</p>
<p>There was a brief pause as the mers gathered in formation along the northeastern edge of the island&rsquo;s shelf processed the conversation. Pat shook her head as she recovered from the strain of long distance CHEW. Behind her, she heard Janice, Jaclyn, and Julie start squealing with joy.</p>
<p>Joy watched Mac with her still developing mer-senses as he swam around the tank, his long body undulating gracefully as he sped past the fish who were clearly confused about what was disturbing their water. She admired the power visible in his tail, even as it was flashing the colors and textures of whatever he was passing before, her mer-senses able to help her see the rippling muscles as they worked beneath his skin. She remembered the first time she saw the mers. God, there had only been a few of them back then. Now, it seemed like mers were popping out the seafloor.</p>
<p>Mac passed by her closely, where she floated a few feet below the surface, keeping her still sensitive skin out of the air. Now that Mac had fully transformed, he could tolerate the air just fine. He had just spent the last two hours outside the tank, doing exercises and testing the limits of his physicality on dry land. He proved as graceful and powerful on dry land as he had in the water, and other than the relatively plain and uniform mocha coloring he now possessed, he seemed much like the mers back on Mermaid Island.</p>
<p>Joy remember how beautiful she thought little Sally-su-su had become as a mermaid. Well, she had been a beautiful little girl, why wouldn&rsquo;t she make a beautiful mermaid. And Eric, he seemed a worthy mate for her little Sally. She remembered Eric&rsquo;s royal blue tail and how beautiful all the mers looked with their many colors. She felt a twinge of regret that she now seemed doomed to be plain brown most of the time. On the other hand, she would be thousands of colors in the water, and perhaps they would learn to control this new feature like the cuttlefish did. She hoped so. Having grown up a plain Jane, brown eyed, brown haired girl, she had been looking forward to the dramatic beauty she thought she might become when she became a mer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ready?&rdquo; Mac asked as came up next to her, finished with his testing of his body and reflexes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Born ready,&rdquo; Joy replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my line,&rdquo; Mac joked. He rose up, his metachrosis snapping off as the air hit his fingers as they grabbed the edge of the tank. &ldquo;You guys ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yup,&rdquo; Kyle answered from behind a camera. &ldquo;Ready for posterity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It still freaks me out when you do that,&rdquo; Brent said. &ldquo;Bamn! you&rsquo;re visible. Poof, you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you transition, you&rsquo;ll be able to see him all the time,&rdquo; Joy said, her face appearing next to his. &ldquo;Mer-senses are the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen anything yet,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;When your mer-senses are fully functional you&rsquo;ll see; it&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then let&rsquo;s do it,&rdquo; Joy said, letting herself sink beneath the surface of the tank.</p>
<p>Mac let himself sink as well, taking a moment to marvel, again, at how beautiful Joy was now that she&rsquo;d filled back out after the parasites nearly killed her. They kissed, Joy pressing the full length of her body into his, her toes only reaching halfway down his much longer tail. Mac tugged on his new vent muscle, releasing his newly enlarged penis, and Joy backed away, watching it emerge.</p>
<p>It felt strange to him, telescoping out from his body, feeling the stiffness both extend down into his tail and outward through his penis. Joy sank down some more, her long brown hair floating upwards like a lion&rsquo;s mane. She looked Mac in the eye as she slid her lips over the end of his enormous penis. Mac focused his mind on the transformation, on same coloring and configuration he had. He wasn&rsquo;t sure if the same seizure would overwhelm either him or Joy, but all the other mers had been able to affect their final coloring, and he wanted his new pod mate to truly be his mate, his match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make me your mermaid,&rdquo; she said, looking up at him.</p>
<p>Joy put her mouth back over his penis and stroked him hard with her hands, willing Mac to give her the siren cells she needed for her transformation. She swirled her tongue around the fat tip, and then sucked hard again. Mac&rsquo;s eyes rolled back in his head, the speed, and force of his arousal surprising him. He felt a gathering of energy deep in his tail, and then it rose up violently, shooting into Joy&rsquo;s mouth. Joy, expecting a somewhat normal orgasm felt overwhelmed by the volume that flooded her mouth.</p>
<p>She maintained her grip and her composure, and swallowed it down. It tasted much the same as she remembered, slightly salty, musky, not exactly tasty, but not horrific. Mac was moaning in pleasure as she felt her mouth fill again as Mac shuddered through another mighty pulse and the energy in her own body began to build. Another pulse, nearly as strong and as filling as the first two filled her mouth again, and she felt a tingle arise in her legs. Another pulse, this one weaker and smaller, but now her body began to move on its own, her legs beginning to stiffen. A final pulse and Mac&rsquo;s moans turned into a tone, a hum.</p>
<p>Joy felt her arms draw away from Mac&rsquo;s penis of their own accord, and she saw Mac&rsquo;s body sink to be even with her own. She could feel energies forming throughout her body as the siren cells and parasites gathered energy for her final transformation. She saw Mac reach out and touch her waist, and the two of them began spinning gently, the other fish in the tank repeating their earlier behavior. She tried to move or blink, and found she could not. She hoped that her face wasn&rsquo;t frozen in a grimace, and felt her legs tighten even further, her toes pointed straight down at the bottom of the tank. She held Mac&rsquo;s gaze, or rather, she realized that he was holding hers, and she focused on his eyes and the sound of his humming.</p>
<p>Mac could feel the urge to hum while the white-hot orgasm still ripped through his body. A mer orgasm was a thousand times more powerful than a human one, he decided. He sank down and put a hand on her waist, feeling the dramatic indent between her waist and wide hips. He focused on her Nj eyes let himself be guided by the powerful forces now surrounding both of them, humming a deep tone that felt natural and right. He noticed the bubbles begin to rise, and soon a wall of bubbles surrounded him and Joy.</p>
<p>Outside the tank, Annette, Brent, Jack, and Kyle watched as the powerful forces overtook the two figures in the water. The bubbles were thicker and more forceful than when Mac had changed. The bubbles actually made it easier to keep track of Mac, as they shimmered around the edges of his otherwise invisible body. They could see Joy more easily despite the thicker bubbles, and her transformation seemed to be happening much more quickly. Within a few hours they could already see her tail forming, and within a mere twelve hours, she was gripped with the final spasms of transformation, looking very much like Mac. None of the four humans left the room, seemingly compelled to witness her entire transformation. As Joy released herself from the arched pose, she too snapped out of view, her skin bending light to hide her.</p>
<p>As the bubbles dissipated, the four humans outside the tank could no longer really see the two camouflaged mers. They waited for a few minutes, hoping they would surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transformation copulation,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;When a new mer is created there is an overwhelming urge to mate, and it affects all the other mers within CHEW distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense are you talking here?&rdquo; Kyle asked. &ldquo;What the heck is a chew distance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside the tank, while Annette brought Kyle up to speed on mer behaviors, Mac and Joy underwent the instinctual forces to mate after transformation. They were stroking each other madly, running their mutually photosensitive limbs and tails along each others' tail, enjoying the frenetic build of their sexual union. When Mac finally pushed into her, it surprised neither of them of the wild gyrations of energies playing along their bodies. The ignition of their internal bioluminescence combined with the light bouncing and bending around on their skin made each of them look like a mer-shaped package of fireworks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Annette said, pointing to the center of the tank.</p>
<p>As the amazed humans watched, they could see two mers clearly in the act of copulating, their bodies flashing with light and energy. They appeared to the humans as mer-shaped bottles of light, colors and patterns and flashes of all kinds zipping across their skins as they stroked back and forth together. Joy&rsquo;s arms were around Mac&rsquo;s neck, Mac having a firm hold on Joy&rsquo;s hips, and their pelvic fins slapping together with each long stroke. All four of them felt their own lust rise, but no one moved, mesmerized by the beauty and passion they could see in the tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This &hellip; is &hellip; amazing,&rdquo; Joy said, feeling a throbbing core of pleasure beginning to rise up from her newly positioned womb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mac said, tightening his grip on her hips, and stroking even faster. In moments, both clutched each other as a massive mutual orgasm rocked their bodies.</p>
<p>Outside the tank, Annette grabbed Brent&rsquo;s hand and dragged him from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how old you are,&rdquo; she said. Brent threw a smirking grin back to Jack and Kyle as he was dragged, quite willingly, from the room.</p>
<p>Kyle gave Jack a long look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even think it,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>If a buyer had walked into the port cabin, looking to buy The Johanna, he or she would have been impressed with how neatly the room had been dismantled. Normally, when someone trashes a room, they tend to throw things around, discard useless pictures, wall coverings, plastic molding, or bits of carpet. The two occupants had carefully picked apart the entire stateroom, without any tools, and still hadn&rsquo;t found a way to make a weapon worth talking about or finding a way out of the room without alerting their captors. One reason why the room was so neat was that neither man possessed the physical ability to break anything, so each item they had pried loose or broken away from the wall had been done with leverage and patience, rather than brute strength.</p>
<p>Malaki lay on the bed while his son lay on the floor. They had spent the better part of a day trying to make a rope out of the bedsheets, and when Peter had come into the room to give them dinner, he had effortlessly taken it from them. The loss of all that work and effort, and the fact that the bed now lacked sheets, had made all their efforts seem completely pointless. Malaki fumed at the helplessness that had overtaken him. He cursed the weakness of his own body, and he cursed the weak creature that his son had turned out to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow we try the carpet,&rdquo; he said with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow you can go fuck yourself,&rdquo; his son said back.</p>
<p>Three days ago, he would have backhanded the youth for such talk. Two weeks ago, he would have sent one of a dozen men to go beat the shit out of the impudent son of a bitch. But today he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to do more than retort, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s these creatures that will fuck you, not me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Torro didn&rsquo;t argue, but he rolled towards the wall, gathering the pillow his father had tossed from the bed under his head, and closed his eyes hoping everything would go away, or be different, or just stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn your back to me!&rdquo; Malaki said. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let them do this to your own father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wish that I was the one doing this to you! Torro thought to himself, but he only said, &ldquo;Leave me alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to die?&rdquo; Malaki asked. &ldquo;Is that what you want?&rdquo;? &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; Torro said, and he meant it. &ldquo;There are worse things than death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing worse than dying,&rdquo; Malaki argued, trying to rouse his son to some level of action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Torro agreed. &ldquo;Living without honor is worse than dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putanginamo!&rdquo; Malaki said to his son. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what honor is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck you, too! You killed my mother,&rdquo; Torro said. &ldquo;You have no honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kill your mother, your brother&rsquo;s killed her,&rdquo; Malaki said. &ldquo;You were there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was trying to protect me from bullies at school,&rdquo; Torro said. &ldquo;The headmaster wasn&rsquo;t her lover! He raped her when she tried to get him to do his job! No one listened to me, I was only ten. No one ever listens to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother dishonored me and our family,&rdquo; Malaki said. &ldquo;She deserved to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You practically ordered Manalo to kill her, and then you wanted to protect your murderous sons,&rdquo; Torro said. &ldquo;You are the one who has dishonored the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You worm, you shit! How dare you question my honor! I will kill you!&rdquo; Malaki sputtered, trying to raise himself from the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like you killed her?&rdquo; Torro said. &ldquo;Well, go ahead. I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Living like a worm is worse than no honor,&rdquo; Malaki said. &ldquo;You have become a worm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have always been a worm!&rdquo; Torro said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not and never will be a worm!&rdquo; Malaki said. &ldquo;I am a man, and I will always be a man. I will live like a man and die like a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you,&rdquo; Torro said.</p>
<p>Malaki wanted to keep yelling at his son, force him to come up with some plans to fight or escape or something, but he couldn&rsquo;t raise his head from the bed. How could this worm be his son? There had to be some drug or something that they were putting in their food that was doing this to them, but he couldn&rsquo;t smell or taste anything unusual. He had tried not eating anything for a day, but that didn&rsquo;t seem to work. Maybe they were putting something in the water, but if they were, he couldn&rsquo;t see it or taste it.</p>
<p>Well, today confirmed a growing suspicion; his youngest son detested him. Malaki now knew that Torro hated nearly everything about him, and that he blamed Malaki for his mother&rsquo;s death. Malaki let that thought hit the center of his being. His own son was now an equal enemy to him as his captors. As he fumed about his son, he heard someone fiddle with the door, unlocking it from the outside. A moment later, the door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hungry boss?&rdquo; a somber Sudhish asked as he entered with two bowls and to water bottles.</p>
<p>Malaki wanted to sit up, leap off the bed, and beat the crap out of his former assistant, but couldn&rsquo;t seem to gather enough strength to sit up, let alone leap from the bed. Sudhish ignored him, putting the two bowls and two water bottles on the one bedside table that hadn&rsquo;t been dismantled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These will wait until you&rsquo;re hungry enough to eat,&rdquo; Sudhish said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You happy now,&rdquo; Malaki spat. &ldquo;Are you happy now that you&rsquo;re free and I&rsquo;m helpless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be free of you,&rdquo; Sudhish said, his face full of sorrow. &ldquo;Your men killed my sister, and I helped you do it. I didn&rsquo;t stop you. I&rsquo;ll never be free of this burden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you gloat over me now?&rdquo; Malaki said, wishing his limbs would fill with adrenaline so that he could grab the small Indian man, use him to force his own release from this hell. As it was, it took the entire sentence for Malaki to sit up, and even then, he felt weak in the wake of the effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gloat?&rdquo; Sudhish challenged. &ldquo;That would require me to care what you thought in the first place,&rdquo; he spat back at his former boss, turning on his heal, and locking the door after he left.</p>
<p>Malaki let himself fall back into the bed. He knew that soon his hunger and thirst would drive him to eat. He was sure that the food or the water was drugged, because he always seemed to get enough energy to eat. It was the same pattern; eat, feel weaker, grow stronger, grow hungry and thirsty, eat, and so on. These people were good, too. They were only giving him and his son enough to survive, thus keeping them perpetually thirsty and hungry, so they were always needing food or water, and thus staying weakened by the drugs they had obviously mixed into the food or water or both. Damn them!</p>
<p>He reviewed, again, the past three days, the past three hellish days. First, those sea creatures had stabbed him with some sort of weapon and paralyzed him and all his bodyguards, Anjo&rsquo;s as well. How stupid he had been! So little research into what was happening. So focused was he on finding and punishing his sons that he had completely misread the situation in Davao. Then, he had been thrown onto this boat, where he had slowly pieced together information to surmise that he was the accidental prize to a rescue mission focused on the girls and not his own capture. He knew that he and his son were heading for somewhere called Mermaid Island, and that something would happen there. He was pretty sure that whatever was going to happen there, he wouldn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>He struggled to sit back up. He knew he needed to get his son&rsquo;s food over to that side of the bed so that Torro, his now confirmed enemy, wouldn&rsquo;t have to get near him. It took him five minutes, but he managed to get the bowl of fish stew, it appeared to be, and the small bottle of water, to the far side of the bed. He lay back down and waited for enough strength to return so that he could satisfy his own now raging thirst and hunger. He cursed the need that drew him to eat and drink, and cursed the food and drink that caused him to curse.</p>
<p>He had never felt such despair or helplessness in his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, ah, didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d find you out here,&rdquo; Jack said as he sat down on the dock next to Brent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annette said she had to share some girl talk with Pat on the radio,&rdquo; Brent said, running his hands through his brown hair that was streaked with gray. &ldquo;I figured she needed some privacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two in the tank don&rsquo;t seem to need much privacy,&rdquo; Jack said, looking out at the bay, watching a single sailboat tack against the wind off to their west. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. Both good looking kids, too. Of course, if I looked that good, I wouldn&rsquo;t care who walked in on me in the middle of &hellip; you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two in the tank are both older than I am,&rdquo; Brent said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, keep forgetting,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;But you too, eh? Younger soon enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; said Brent, his voice tight with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Jack asked. &ldquo;Not a mermaid, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Jack, my old friend,&rdquo; Brent said, slapping Jack on the back, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t use many words, but you&rsquo;re always direct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yup,&rdquo; Jack nodded. He waited for a few moments, both of them sitting in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not gonna laugh at me, are ya?&rdquo; Brent asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Jack said. A few more moments passed as the sunlight dappled on the dark, gray water. The sails on the distant sailboat snapped and cracked as the boat turned and made another tack against the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annette made it clear to me that she was going to be a mermaid no matter what,&rdquo; Brent began. He stuffed his nervous hands into the pockets of the light jacket he had thrown on to go outside. &ldquo;And that she wanted to be with her old friends, together. Joy, Mac, and me, and there was only one way to do that, and, well, it just seemed like everyone expected that I would be the third mermaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody asked you?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Brent answered. &ldquo;Not in any real way. I suppose they didn&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo; He paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sound ungrateful for your help and friendship over the years, but what has this got to do with you?&rdquo; Brent challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You already lost five bucks,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;You want to lose more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yea,&rdquo; Brent said, mollified. &ldquo;You might have to make the same choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the same one,&rdquo; Jack argued. &ldquo;But a similar one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Brent said. They both sat in silence again for a few moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, why didn&rsquo;t they have to ask you?&rdquo; Jack repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you ever wondered about it yourself?&rdquo; Brent asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About becoming a mermaid?&rdquo; Jack asked. &ldquo;No, not ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Brent said. &ldquo;What about having tits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Jack said, smiling. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t every 13 year old boy? Of course, I didn&rsquo;t think about wearing tits, just having &lsquo;em close by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you never thought about what it would feel like to actually have tits?&rdquo; Brent asked, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;Honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; Brent said. &ldquo;I guess I must be weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the wierdo, trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Brent said. &ldquo;I still wonder &hellip; you know &hellip; what it would be like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Jack said. They sat in silence again. &ldquo;Did you ever pretend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; Brent said. &ldquo;But only once, and I was like twelve or something. But it sticks with you, you know, the memory and the curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God,&rdquo; Brent sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a former Navy man! You trying to embarrass me or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just curious. Seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, he said &ldquo;I borrowed my older sister&rsquo;s bra. I stuffed it with athletic socks and then put on my own tee shirt and just, you know, walked around. It was sort of weird, but sort of exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;It do much for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Brent said. &ldquo;I was just experimenting. Being with a real girl with real tits makes all the difference. Those were much more exciting than those socks and a tee shirt. But I didn&rsquo;t get to first base with anyone until I was sixteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the rest, you know?&rdquo; Brent said. &ldquo;Not just tits, I mean, the whole package&ndash;top to bottom. Because women sure look like they&rsquo;re having fun, you know, when they have those big, long, orgasms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Jack agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And more than one,&rdquo; Brent said. &ldquo;That would be interesting; to have more than one orgasm at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s interesting enough to become a girl?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mermaid,&rdquo; Brent said. &ldquo;Yeah, I think so. But it still scares the crap out of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;I can see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Rose had spilled the beans via CHEW about her pregnancy, Ann and Kate had giggled for nearly an hour, knowing that their moms were going crazy for more information and teasing Rose for being so clever. Rose made it clear that it was an accident, but she secretly enjoyed the torture both Janice and Jaclyn were undergoing as well. In the next twenty-four hours, Trevor&rsquo;s pod had surveyed two new atolls, one of which had a natural spring. They had found and marked a dozen or more shipwrecks, mostly from World War II. Rose had taught both Ann and Kate how to &lsquo;paint&rsquo; using the polymerization technique, but everyone agreed that Rose was the only artist among them. Ann and Kate proved able to make polymerized sculptures, however, and could even make mer-bands, and with testing, they found that the ones they made were just as effective as the one&rsquo;s Rose had fashioned.</p>
<p>Nearly twenty-four hours after their conversation with Pat they discovered a field of debris floating in the ocean. The wreckage looked so fresh that they decided to investigate. The seafloor was far, far below them, but there was evidence of what looked like a plane crash floating over a wide area. After an hour or so of searching, Rose spotted the raft. On investigating, they discovered that the raft had a small group of humans in it. They were all unconscious, severely dehydrated, and near death.</p>
<p>They towed the raft to the atoll they had just catalogued the day before, the one with the spring, and they hoped that would be enough. But after a closer examination, the mers discovered that only mermaid milk could save them. At first, they were reluctant to interfere, but Rose convinced them that life was too precious, and that while they might condemn the humans to join them as mers, they had an obligation to save them.</p>
<p>They quickly gave each of the humans the life-saving draught of mermaid milk, but the two survivors who fed from Rose had received milk from a pregnant mermaid, more powerful and concentrated than her sisters&rsquo; milk. Once the humans regained consciousness, the mers spent the better part of two days helping them prepare for survival on the small atoll. Some of the humans seemed eager to accept the full gift of the siren cells. But the others were reluctant to consider being mers.</p>
<p>Rose found an ally in the group, and she hatched a plan for time to work its magic, rather than forcing the issue with logic or reason. The siren cells would do their work, and time would heal all wounds. The mers left without deliberately crushing the hopes of those who hoped to return to the &ldquo;civilized world&rdquo;, and offered a promise that they would come back to check on them in the future.</p>
<p>They continued on their mission to map and chart the area&rsquo;s resources and landmarks, and then started their return trip to Mermaid Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Bartholomew Kolbert, how can I help you?&rdquo; the Connor&rsquo;s lawyer and CFO of the Marine Mammal Institute answered the phone briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you Mr. Kolbert,&rdquo; the reedy tenor voice responded. &ldquo;My name is Jackson Baker, and I believe you have my portfolio before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, Mr. Baker,&rdquo; Bart answered. &ldquo;The fax came through just fine. Most impressive, but I have to give you my honest professional advice, and that is I&rsquo;m not likely to be much help on the east coast. I&rsquo;ve been based in California my entire career. You would be far better off using a real estate lawyer based in the East to handle your transaction. I can refer you to one of my partners in Washington or northern Virginia if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand and appreciate your professional ethics and advice,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;However, I&rsquo;ve been asked to tell you that you should open Appendix T before we proceed further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand: Appendix T?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hank Connor,&rdquo; Jackson said into the phone. &ldquo;He was your client, and he has asked me to tell you to open Appendix T.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip; yes &hellip; have you actually heard from Hank?&rdquo; Bart asked. &ldquo;I mean, I haven&rsquo;t heard from him in several weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only been told to tell you to open Appendix T,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that I cannot say more until after you have unsealed those documents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I to know that your request is legitimate?&rdquo; Bart asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kolbert,&rdquo; Jackson began. &ldquo;If my portfolio isn&rsquo;t enough, nor is the scope of my business I wish to have you supervise enough, than I hardly know what else I might say to convince you that my request is legitimate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hank should have given you some sort of information that would help you make contact with me,&rdquo; Bart suggested, trying to remain professional. &ldquo;Do you have anything that might help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Janice told me that you are the only one they could trust not to follow them to their island because you hate the water,&rdquo; Jackson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Baker,&rdquo; Bart said, his tone changing. &ldquo;It will be my pleasure to handle your business, but you will allow me to unseal Appendix T and get up to speed on what Mr. and Mrs. Connor&rsquo;s wishes actually might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected no less,&rdquo; answered Jackson. &ldquo;I look forward to hearing back from you shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will contact you at this number as soon as I am able,&rdquo; Bart said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Kolbert,&rdquo; Jackson said, hanging up the phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really going to do this, aren&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; Annette said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When have I ever gone back on my word?&rdquo; Jackson challenged as he swiveled in his chair, facing his old friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Speaking of which, I&rsquo;ve got to head downstairs. You going to watch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t miss it for the world,&rdquo; Jack answered, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the phone call?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an extension in the viewing room,&rdquo; Jackson said with some exasperation. &ldquo;I entered the 21st century at the front of the pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;I keep forgetting that you were one of the most eminent technologists in the country. Around here, you just look like another weather beaten oysterman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yup,&rdquo; Jack said with a smile. &ldquo;Makes things easier if you blend in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they walked from the Baker house kitchen, down the basement steps, through the secret door, and down into the viewing room for the aquarium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They back yet?&rdquo; Annette asked Brent, who was lying on the cot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The arming light for the outer locks just turned off, so they should appear in a few seconds,&rdquo; he said with a nod towards the console near the seaward side of the tank.</p>
<p>Kyle entered from the machine room, &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s fine, just like you designed it years ago. That system will last for five hundred years, even if global warming raises the sea level a full meter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to be selling it,&rdquo; Jack said wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be selling it to yourself, in a way,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;Once this island becomes part of the Marine Mammals Institute, and you being one of those marine mammals, you&rsquo;ll still be here to fix the system if it needs repairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And putting up with getting poked and prodded and studied?&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get poked and prodded by Pat and her fellow scientists on Mermaid Island if you go there, you can count on that!&rdquo; Joy said as she popped into view, Mac shimmering next to her a second later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land Sakes, Woman!&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;You took a half year off my life! Don&rsquo;t do that again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry about that,&rdquo; Joy said, her long body hanging from the top of the glass wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait to speak until after my camo turns off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a hole,&rdquo; Mac said as he dipped down into the water. The four humans all scattered from the center of the room just as Mac launched himself from the water, pulled himself into a tuck position, and gently rolled in a forward flip that he held as he rolled onto the floor below for another full rotation. He opened up into a cheesecake pose, one hand under his head, the other propped on his hip, his long tail perfectly straight, and his flukes vertically rising into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show off,&rdquo; Joy said as she hoisted herself up onto the top of the glass, gracefully turning her hips and swinging her tail into the room. She then slid down the glass, letting her tail guide her into a graceful slide across the floor. The water still clung to her body offering lubrication, until she barreled into Mac causing him to spin into her. He caught her in his arms and rolled so that she was pinned beneath him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love me,&rdquo; Mac said grinning like a teenager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I do,&rdquo; Joy said, pulling him into a kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a room,&rdquo; Brent joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need a room,&rdquo; Mac said, rolling off Joy, her beautiful brown body still dripping with water. &ldquo;We just need water and no one can see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joy sat up next to Mac, her now larger breasts swaying as she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just incredible,&rdquo; said Annette, her eyes shining. &ldquo;You both look so amazing, so powerful. I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s only been a day since you both changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is pretty incredible,&rdquo; Joy agreed, pulling her wet hair past her ears. &ldquo;Though I envy the other mers' hydrophobia, this wet long hair is a pain in the ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no longer possess an ass,&rdquo; Mac joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then what do you call this?&rdquo; Joy asked, rolling onto her side, showing off her still very shapely posterior, her dorsal ridge now bisecting two large muscle masses that still looked exactly like a human girl&rsquo;s rear end, and a particularly beautiful one at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful, that&rsquo;s what I call that,&rdquo; Mac said, giving it a wet slap. Joy squealed and rolled back into a sitting position. &ldquo;But that,&rdquo; he continued, pointing to a spot about halfway down her tail along the front, &ldquo;is your new ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s my sphincter,&rdquo; Jay said, still pulling tangles from her hair. &ldquo;An ass is the part of your body upon which you sit. My ass is still there,&rdquo; she said pointing to her the back of her hips. &ldquo;My sphincter is the only thing that moved here,&rdquo; she waved her hand down her front. &ldquo;Now, you have to move over there,&rdquo; she told Mac, pointing to a spot along the far wall. &ldquo;I have work to do,&rdquo; she announced, rolling her shoulders so that her breasts moved seductively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it feel different, your sphincter, I mean?&rdquo; Kyle asked, then blushing realizing the intimacy the question suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in any way I think I could describe,&rdquo; Joy said ignoring Kyle&rsquo;s discomfort. &ldquo;I was never much for the backdoor to begin with, and now it&rsquo;s even less important to me as an erogenous zone. But these,&rdquo; she continued, hefting her breasts, watching a bit of milk ooze from each nipple. &ldquo;These are much more interesting than they used to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are bigger too,&rdquo; Annette observed. &ldquo;Will that happen to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you talk to Pat on the radio about the strategy for today?&rdquo; Joy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we didn&rsquo;t talk much about me, mostly about Brent, remember?&rdquo; Annette said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Right. Well, how big they might be has a lot to do with what Mac is imagining,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;So, what do you want?&rdquo; she asked, turning to her pod-mate who had scooted over to the far wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breasts are just as interesting to me as they always were,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;But as you can see from Joy, I was never into freakishly large breasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a relief,&rdquo; Annette said. She noticed that her husband had become very quiet. &ldquo;You O.K.?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure,&rdquo; Brent said without much conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; Mac asked. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t sound sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Brent said, with more bravado. &ldquo;So, how should we do this, or rather, what is it that I have to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are being very brave,&rdquo; Annette said, looking at her husband of many years. &ldquo;I promise you that you&rsquo;ll be very happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. And I do love you,&rdquo; Brent said, looking, and feeling, every inch the frail, old man he appeared to be. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know if I can &hellip; if I can &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; said Annette. &ldquo;The first part is easy. We both feed from Joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brent glanced down at Joy&rsquo;s beautiful breasts, her dark brown nipples extended, with the mermaid milk that was oozing from the tips in stark, white contrast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult,&rdquo; he joked as he sat down on the other side of Joy, glancing over at Mac to make sure he was still against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you approve,&rdquo; Joy said, her young face smiling at her old friend. &ldquo;How often do you get to play with another woman&rsquo;s breasts while your wife watches and not get in any trouble, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no playing, just feeding,&rdquo; Annette said with mock anger. &ldquo;Got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it,&rdquo; Brent said, feeling some of the tension leave his body. &ldquo;So, how long will this take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;Pat seemed to think it might be anywhere between three days to three weeks. We don&rsquo;t have the actual Moon Pool, though this tank is lovely, Jack. We don&rsquo;t have the tiaras that Rose makes, which speed things up, but we do have a steady supply of mermaid milk, and two mers with fully developed mer-organs to focus their energies on our transformation. I guess we&rsquo;ll just have to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just lean back and let me cradle your head,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;Annette will be right next to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brent turned onto his back, letting Joy support the back of his head. She brought him to her breast, and he took the nipple into his mouth and began to suck. Immediately, a stream of warm, sweet, milk gushed into his mouth, and within seconds he could feel the tingling effects of the siren cells as they began their work on his body. Annette&rsquo;s head brushed against his own as she began feeding on Joy&rsquo;s other breast, and Brent felt his body relax some more.</p>
<p>Joy sighed with contentment, the wash of hormones released from feeding flowing through her body. It felt so good, so satisfying to feed someone. It was even more satisfying to do two at once! She could feel the milk flowing from her body, her breasts becoming less full. For several minutes, the room was silent except for the gentle sounds of sucking and drinking.</p>
<p>Brent felt the flow slacken, and as it stopped, he gave Joy&rsquo;s nipple one last kiss, whisking away a final droplet of milk. As he pulled back from her breast, he laid his head on her tail, just below her pelvic fins, and watched as Annette finished her transformational meal, her gray-blond hair silvery in the morning light filtering down from the skylight above. When Annette pulled away, Brent felt a hand on his leg. He turned and saw that Mac had stealthily moved to his side, and had grabbed him. His stomach lurched, and he reflexively kicked his leg, but Mac held on and pulled Brent to him, his head thumping on the floor as it fell from Joy&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the fu&mdash;&ndash;&rdquo; Brent said before Mac clamped his hand over Brent&rsquo;s face, silencing him. Mac quickly wrapped his other arm around Brent&rsquo;s torso and drew him into a bear hug, pinning his arms at his sides. When Brent kicked his legs, Mac wrapped his tail around them, tightening his hold on Brent like a boa constrictor. Brent tried to scream, but his mouth was securely covered by Mac&rsquo;s strong, brown hand. He didn&rsquo;t expect Mac to be so strong. God, he was strong!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shush,&rdquo; Mac said softly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine, don&rsquo;t struggle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kyle and Jack watched with shock on their faces. The scene reminded both men of an antelope in a lion&rsquo;s jaws, the life and death struggle of the antelope contrasted with the power and confidence of the lion. Brent&rsquo;s eyes showed both his terror and his effort as he struggled against Mac&rsquo;s unrelenting embrace, his entire body straining and jerking. But Mac was unshakable. Time seemed to slow to an agonizing pace, and Brent could feel a fiery tickle that ran up along the base of his spine before sputtering out at the base of his skull. After a few more seconds, Brent gave one last great heave and then finally stopped struggling, lying limp in Mac&rsquo;s arms. Annette scrambled from Joy&rsquo;s side to embrace her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so brave,&rdquo; she said, tears in her eyes. &ldquo;I love you so much,&rdquo; kissing his forehead.</p>
<p>Brent&rsquo;s eyes softened as his wife kissed him, and Mac took his hand away from his face, but kept the other arm firmly about his waist. Mac brought his arm around Annette, and hugged her next to Brent. Joy salamandered over to the trio, and laid her upper torso over Brent&rsquo;s, her breasts pressing into his chest, her face before his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very brave,&rdquo; Joy said, and kissed him gently on the lips.</p>
<p>Brent felt the kiss melt across his lips like warm chocolate, and his body seemed to fall into Mac&rsquo;s as Joy pressed down on him. He recognized a twinge of desire for the strong male body holding him, even as he was suddenly jealous of the warm fullness of Joy&rsquo;s youthful breasts as they pressed against his own flat, old, chest. Joy&rsquo;s tongue snaked into his mouth as he felt Annette kissing his shoulder and neck, and Brent decided that the feelings that were building in his body were good ones, and she embraced them. She fought a joyful duel with Joy&rsquo;s tongue, which the mermaid energetically returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Joy as she broke from the passionate kiss, her own face flush with desire. &ldquo;I told you that you would be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s a bonnie lass,&rdquo; Mac said, releasing her from his grasp. He reached around all three girls and brought them into a group hug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; Annette said, snuggling into Mac&rsquo;s shoulder, kissing the top of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you like?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bonnie,&rdquo; Annette said, tilting her face up and drawing her into a kiss. They kissed a long soulful kiss, while Mac stroked her short, brown and gray-speckled hair. They separated from the kiss, her eyes watery with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bonnie?&rdquo; she asked, sounding it out for herself. &ldquo;Bonnie,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I like that too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bart,&rdquo; are you alright?&rdquo; Jaclyn asked, clicking on the radio&rsquo;s send button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hank &hellip; er &hellip; Jaclyn?&rdquo; Bart stumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Bart, that&rsquo;s right, Jaclyn,&rdquo; she repeated, smiling at the rest of her pod as they enjoyed the surprise and amazement Bart was showing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously, right?&rdquo; Bart continued. &ldquo;You turned into a girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, I turned into a mermaid, Bart,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A real, live mermaid. Now, I need you to pull it together, buddy. I&rsquo;ve given you all the keywords, you know it&rsquo;s real, so let&rsquo;s get it together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jaci, go easy on the man,&rdquo; Janice said. &ldquo;His heart is strong, but it&rsquo;s not shatterproof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Janice, is that you?&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;Your voice sounds different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a mermaid too,&rdquo; Janice answered. &ldquo;Our voices are even prettier live than over the airwaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a mermaid too?&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;But &hellip; what &hellip; how &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still married, technically,&rdquo; Janice said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll understand when we send you more information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both you and Hank &hellip; er &hellip; Jaclyn &hellip; mermaids!&rdquo; Bart said, shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As are all three of our kids,&rdquo; Janice said. &ldquo;Even Robbie is now a mermaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;This is incredible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Jaclyn said. &ldquo;So, can you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Bart asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Establish my new legal identity and assemble a group of experts to serve on the board of trustees for the MMI,&rdquo; Jaclyn said. &ldquo;I would imagine that the second part is easier than the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, right. That,&rdquo; Bart said, still stunned. &ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s probably a good thing you signed over all power of attorney to me. I&rsquo;m pretty sure we could get your new sex changed pretty easily, but your change in species might be more problematic. We&rsquo;ll have to make you public knowledge to someone. I&rsquo;ll do what you say, of course, but the American government is not under any obligation to recognize mermaids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know we have a long, hard road ahead,&rdquo; Jaclyn agreed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m still me, and I still plan on running both the MMI and our foundation. I&rsquo;m glad to hear that I can depend on you, my friend. I don&rsquo;t know what I would do without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either,&rdquo; agreed Bart. &ldquo;But if your foundation keeps growing like this, I mean &hellip; this is just incredible. You were already really, really rich, but when we add the Wainwright assets and the Baker estate and trust, assuming the this deal goes through on Taylor Island, well then&ndash;Christ!&ndash; only the Gates Foundation will have more assets than we do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, that even impresses me,&rdquo; Jaclyn said. &ldquo;I hope that that amount of money can solve a thorny identity problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t hurt,&rdquo; Bart agreed. &ldquo;It will open a lot of doors, but some doors can&rsquo;t be pried open. I mean, imagine what Focus on the Family will have to say about you and the MMI!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already imagined, but you do what you think is best. We trust your judgment,&rdquo; Jaclyn said. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re welcome to come for a visit any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Not me,&rdquo; Bart said with a laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll happily stay a landlubber and keep your affairs here nice and tidy. This job pays very well, thanks to you and your generosity, but I&rsquo;ll stay on dry land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give the radio over to Pat, and she&rsquo;s going to dictate some stuff we need you to purchase for us, and she&rsquo;ll also detail how we need it delivered,&rdquo; Jaclyn said. &ldquo;We can be patient on the identity problem for the moment, but it puts you in a precarious position, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so,&rdquo; Bart asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If something were to happen to you, the entire foundation could go into probate,&rdquo; Jaclyn said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made provisions for that, actually, a long time ago. I have a group of like-minded men and women who know I&rsquo;m protecting an environmental group from exploitation. That group has been named executors of all my business and legacy accounts. A few of them will be tapped for the MMI Board. You&rsquo;ll be as well protected as you can be, legally at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s at least a relief,&rdquo; Jaclyn said. &ldquo;Thanks, and here&rsquo;s Pat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Bart interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still here,&rdquo; Jaclyn said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Technically, you are in Kiribati,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;And while MMI owns the island, thank you very much, you and your family, regardless of your sex or your species, are there illegally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of that,&rdquo; Jaclyn said. &ldquo;I was hoping that you would be able to solve that issue as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;I will do my best, but there are two issues here: the first, is that we may have an easier time with our trans-species citizenship once I get you in Kiribati legally. The second is that there are probably others there in your position, yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Pat said, over Jaclyn&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Many of us are not here on a visa or other legal authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; Bart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a problem?&rdquo; Jaclyn asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is potentially a problem,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;And money is a near universal cure for most problems. We&rsquo;ll take this slow, but we have some big work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be guided by your excellent advice, my friend,&rdquo; Jaclyn said. &ldquo;You just tell me what you need me to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given me most of your legal documents for you and your family in Appendix T, which I suppose stands for tail, right?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jaclyn said. &ldquo;Sorry for the pun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need to get similar documents for everyone else, and that will take time and money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of which you have,&rdquo; Jaclyn said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll need your say so to and the list of your people to start that process. I can keep things out of the public eye for a long time, but not forever. You&rsquo;re going to have to come up with a coming out party of some kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re working on that, Mr. Kolbert,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you might as well take over Pat,&rdquo; said Jaclyn. &ldquo;You have my say so, Bart, and Pat will give you that list of stuff, and all the information you need,&rdquo; she finished as she moved aside to let Pat have the microphone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello Mr. Kolbert,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re a mermaid too,&rdquo; Bart joked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got that same bell thing going on in your voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, we are all mers here, or will be shortly,&rdquo; Pat said thinking of Harold. &ldquo;One of the things we&rsquo;re ordering today, with your help, is a better satellite up-link for telecommunications, Internet and such. The next time we talk, you&rsquo;ll be able to see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;Well, mermaid or not, please call me Bart. All of Hank&rsquo;s, ah, er, Jaclyn&rsquo;s friends should call me Bart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Bart,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;You ready for the information?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pencil&rsquo;s sharp, and ready to go,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>The stars twinkled in their multitudes above a perfectly white, sandy beach that curved like a scimitar around a small lagoon. Behind the beach, a single cone of a small volcano rose up dramatically from the small jungle that encircled it on three sides. The scene might have looked like a painting of a perfect little paradise to someone hovering overhead, but no airplane was visible in the vast expanse of the peaceful, night sky. The small island looked and felt like it was the only inhabited place in a universe of ocean.</p>
<p>Assembled on in the middle of that arching beach was a large group of mermaids and mermen, their many colors visible even in the starlight. Intermingled among this colorful and beautiful throng were a smaller group of humans, and in the center of everyone, two men were trussed up together, each bound to the other, their legs outstretched in opposite directions. Both men seemed physically tired to the point of exhaustion, but their minds were alert and their hearts were beating in terror.</p>
<p>They had been on the beach since late afternoon, sharing stories. The first to go were the mers, many of them speaking, sharing the tale of how they got there, and what had happened to them. Harold Matthews, who had spent the longest among mers while still being a human, went next. Several of the mers noted the interest two of the captive girls seemed to show in the handsome young man. Then each of the rescued girls shared their brief tales, then Sudhish, and then the human members of the rescue team. By now, it was late evening; the sun had been gone from the sky for about an hour. Only two more people had yet to share their story. The two men lying trussed up in the center of the group.</p>
<p>One of the mermaids took off a utility belt she was wearing, salamandered over to the two men, and put her hand over the younger man&rsquo;s forehead. He started to say something, but a single glance from the mermaid stopped him. She looked at him for many minutes, studying his face, never moving her hand from his head.</p>
<p>The boy noted that her skin was impossibly smooth and her touch was gentle. Her face was mesmerizing, beautiful, and captivating, and the boy could not look away from her. She had hazel eyes that sparkled rich hues of color from within and long auburn hair. Nestled within her thick, luxurious hair was a sparkling tiara that went just across her forehead just below her hairline. It lay flush to her skin, perfectly fitted to her individual skull, and it looked as though it had been woven from thousands of tiny strands of wire, though no wire he&rsquo;d ever seen sparkled and shimmered with color and light like these did. In the center of the gleaming, silvery diadem was an ornamental peak that lay flat against the mermaid&rsquo;s forehead, and it looked like folds in a blanket, but more complex, like an Escher drawing. Along each temple another ornamental weaving depicted a staff encircled by intertwining snakes.</p>
<p>The artistic and medical contexts of the symbols were lost on the young boy, but he marveled in the beauty and power the crown seemed to give to the mermaid. Her sea green tail had pink highlights, marking her as the apparent sister to one of the other mers who looked much like her. However, this mermaid had an extraordinarily gentle manner about her, and her eyes seemed to pierce right through the young man&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to answer my sister&rsquo;s questions slowly and honestly,&rdquo; she said to him. &ldquo;Do not lie, I will know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man, barely twenty-one, nodded.</p>
<p>The other mermaid who almost looked like her twin, salamandered closer, settling her tail along the other side of the young man&rsquo;s legs. The boy noticed that this mermaid&rsquo;s tiara lacked any ornamentation at her temples, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to suggest that this mermaid was less important than the others. He could tell that this one was the lead mermaid. She crossed her arms under her considerable breasts and gave the young man a severe look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name is Torro Dimaunahan, correct?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>The young man said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man behind you is your father, Malaki?&rdquo; Pat continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Torro repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where your other brothers are?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why you are here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your people brought me here,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why we have brought you here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s something my father has done,&rdquo; he said with some venom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your fucking mouth shut, you idiot,&rdquo; Malaki hissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; Torro retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell these people anything they want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to like your father much,&rdquo; Pat said, looking at her sister Bridget to see how Torro was doing. Bridget gave her a wink that told her Torro was being very truthful at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bastard, and he deserves to die,&rdquo; Torro spat, despite his venom induced lethargy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I very much agree with you,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;But why do you feel that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He killed my mother,&rdquo; Torro gasped. &ldquo;I have sworn revenge,&rdquo; his words tinged with both anger and sadness. &ldquo;I have sworn it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will kill you, you bastard whore-son!&rdquo; Malaki spat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to kill anyone,&rdquo; Pat said casually. &ldquo;And if you cannot be quiet, we will put the gag back on. You threatened Sudhish, remember? Do you understand that all we ask is that you wait your turn?&rdquo; Malaki was silent. &ldquo;I said, do &hellip; you &hellip; understand?&rdquo; Pat asked with deadly seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck you!&rdquo; Malaki said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it that everyone in your organization always says the same thing? John, my darling, would you do the honors?&rdquo; Pat asked in a cheery voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course my dear,&rdquo; John said, salamandering over to Malaki and effortlessly slipping a gag over his mouth and securing it behind his head. Malaki&rsquo;s outburst was muffled behind the gag, and he gave in a few seconds, knowing that the mers wouldn&rsquo;t release the gag a second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;Now, where were we, oh, yes, Torro wants to kill his father. How very Greek.&rdquo; She looked at her sister again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s telling the truth,&rdquo; Bridget said. &ldquo;Pulse, breathing, pupils, skin temperature, everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about your heart?&rdquo; Pat asked. &ldquo;What does your heart tell you, my sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Torro is as much a victim as Emma, Sudhish, or any of the others,&rdquo; Bridget said. Pat nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Torro, what else can you tell us of your father?&rdquo; Pat asked. Behind Torro, Malaki again struggled weakly against his bonds and screamed into his gag. Torro waited for his father to give up, and he didn&rsquo;t have to wait long. Malaki could not keep up his tirade under the influence of mermaid venom and slumped against his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father looks like a successful business man; politically connected, sending all his sons to the best universities money can buy, but he actually runs one of the largest crime syndicates in the world,&rdquo; Torro said. &ldquo;His organization runs under the cover of a legitimate business exporting trinkets and wood to the West, but what he really does is import and export weapons, drugs, and prostitutes. You already know about the Basra&rsquo;s and their story, and the Thompson&rsquo;s story and how Alberto was my father&rsquo;s number one man. But he&rsquo;s worse than that. He kills people as a business practice, as a hobby, just for fun. He killed my &hellip; my &hellip; mother when I was very young as an example to his sons, my older brothers mostly, to show us what happened to anyone who disobeyed him. She &hellip; she &hellip; she tried to protect me from a beating; that was her disobedience. She fought to protect me, and he &hellip; he &hellip;&rdquo; Torro stopped, trying to regain control of his emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awful,&rdquo; Pat agreed. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He killed her because she loved me,&rdquo; Torro said, barely holding it together. &ldquo;She loved me &hellip; he killed her! He must die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Torro, we believe you,&rdquo; Pat said, looking at his face earnestly. &ldquo;But we are working very hard on not killing people. Do you think you could let justice take its course and not kill your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Torro looked from Bridget to Pat and then to the surrounding mers and humans he could see. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to stem the tears that had arisen unbidden. Finally, he could bear it no longer, and sobbed out, &ldquo;My mother &hellip; it was my mother &hellip; I &hellip; have &hellip; sworn.&rdquo; He now sobbed uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Bridget moved in closer to the boy, and gathered him into her arms, pressing his head into her shoulder and breast. She held him while he gasped out great, heaving sobs of mourning. No one spoke, but one could hear several of the mers and humans choking back their own tears. Many had lost loved ones, and the wrenching sounds of honest loss were impossible to ignore. After many minutes, Torro calmed down and stopped sobbing. Elise salamandered over to her pod-mate and handed her a strip of cloth from the medical utility belt that all the mers in James' pod wore. Bridget used it to clean the boy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should untie the boy,&rdquo; Elise said to Pat, who nodded in agreement. Together they released Torro from his shared captivity with his father. He collapsed into Bridget&rsquo;s embrace and curled into a ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Debra asked as she joined her pod-mates in comforting the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to do anything. WE are going to share responsibility for any justice we undertake,&rdquo; Pat said. She turned to the older, still human, Emma who was surrounded by the surviving Basra&rsquo;s, Sudhish, Rani, and Vidya. &ldquo;What do you wish to have done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emma said nothing, her eyes full of hatred. She looked over at Sudhish, and he nodded, an unspoken agreement passed between them. Sudhish looked over at his old boss, and then at his two sisters, and finally returned to Emma&rsquo;s disfigured but gentle face. &ldquo;Death is too good for him,&rdquo; he spat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could force him to join his sons,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if he joined his other sons as a dolphin,&rdquo; said Rani, her eyes hard and cold. &ldquo;I could not live in the same waters with such a creature.&rdquo; Emma, Vidya, and Sudhish nodded vigorously in agreement.</p>
<p>Malaki Dimaunahan listened to the conversation with growing horror and despair. He knew he was going to die, of that much he was certain. But how was he to die? He feared some kind of transformation the most. It was almost surreal when the mers had called up his former sons to the beach, watching the small pod of dolphins frolic in the shallow surf, and trying to understand that two of the creatures were actually his sons. Impossible, but then so too were mermaids. They were all around him, and he could not escape the possibility that they could actually have transformed his sons into dolphins.</p>
<p>Anything but a mere beast, a food source! No, he must die the death of a man, but how? He was kept weakened by their venom (at least he now knew what was done to him), and he could barely stand. He tried to shut out the argument that was rising in intensity around him to come up with a plan for taking some sort of control of the situation. How he wished that, like Alberto&ndash;that crafty son of a bitch&ndash;he had a hidden weapon on his body. At least he could take his son with him in death, and maybe a few of these hideously beautiful creatures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not comfortable with killing a captive,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;I want being a mer to mean something different, maybe even better, than being human. We don&rsquo;t want to become a society that regularly kills humans!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The number one predator of humans is humans,&rdquo; John said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not be too romantic about what it might mean to be mer or human. Life is pretty messy, and it shares more similarities across species than differences. Someday, the most dangerous thing to a mer might be another mer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; Phoebe said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I imagined or hoped for when all this started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not either,&rdquo; John said, putting his arm around his pod-mate. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m just saying it&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat, I&rsquo;m confused,&rdquo; Danni said, laying the sleeping Freya next to her sister Maureen and salamandering to her pod-mate. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between not killing Malaki and The Device?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danni!&rdquo; Pat said, surprised and angered by her own pod-mate&rsquo;s challenge. &ldquo;Please, not now,&rdquo; she pleaded, pointing to their captives and new guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Danni said softly but firmly, &ldquo;we must talk about it now. It&rsquo;s been hanging over everything for a long time, and no one here is leaving this island. They will all join us, in one form or another, or die. You know that to be true. It&rsquo;s safe to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat looked at Phoebe and saw her other pod-mate nod in agreement. She looked behind her at Galina and Alexis, and they both nodded as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, we will talk about it,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one stopped Petra, Gail, and Xing when they killed Alberto,&rdquo; Danni argued. &ldquo;There was justice there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vengeance is never justice,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying Alberto didn&rsquo;t deserve to die, but we killed him because he killed Michael, not because we were serving some higher purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what higher purpose should we be serving when we are confronted with someone who kills us to get what he or she wants?&rdquo; demanded Gabriel in a low voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we deserve to be able to protect ourselves? Isn&rsquo;t that the primary purpose of The Device?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but The Device isn&rsquo;t supposed to kill anyone,&rdquo; Pat argued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fail-safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that device represents safety, then we have already failed,&rdquo; Bridget said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying you shouldn&rsquo;t have done it, but Pat, you have to understand that we should be trying to work towards a solution wherein the thing we do as soon as we can is to dismantle and destroy that horrific device because we won&rsquo;t need it anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree, absolutely!&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re trying to build a society here that is better than merely our instincts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is an instinct,&rdquo; Galina said, looking at her pod-mates. &ldquo;I think we should try to live up to our instincts, and not try to be better than them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Galina is right,&rdquo; Danni argued. &ldquo;What is greater than the power of love? That&rsquo;s what binds us all together. We can call it mer-bonds, or part of our CHEW, or just plain old love, but none of that matters. Love is the same no matter how it occurs, and no matter in what brains it occurs! Love is greater than that damned device and its life-ending chemical reaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love is also a chemical reaction,&rdquo; Galina said. &ldquo;In our brains &hellip; it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if love is a post card from outer space!&rdquo; Danni argued. &ldquo;It is still something that happens to us. It&rsquo;s real. It actually happens, especially if it is a chemical reaction. Those chemicals had to be released and mixed together for a reason. Love is the reason. Love is real. Love changed me from a failed, miserable, drug-runner into a loved and loving person, a mother! Don&rsquo;t you see, we need to be guided by the love we share, both when it&rsquo;s romantic and wonderful and when it is dangerous and dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Device isn&rsquo;t merely a chemical reaction, and neither is love,&rdquo; Pat argued. &ldquo;Both are complex, and both are real. But so too is the threat that the world will not allow us to live in peace, or that we&rsquo;ll be overwhelmed by those who would exploit us or enslave us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But our strategies, our plans, should still be based on love,&rdquo; Danni said. &ldquo;This is a truth I know; it&rsquo;s a truth you, and Phoebe, and John have taught me. But mostly it&rsquo;s a truth that Freya, Cynthia, and Maureen have taught me &hellip; taught all of us. Can&rsquo;t you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Bridget said, still stroking Torro&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Love is the answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know what that means,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;What answer to slavery, murder, prostitution, or China simply attacking and overwhelming us can we find in love? Love couldn&rsquo;t even save Christ from being killed or his message being twisted into the most violent forms of hate and murder the world has ever known. I mean, good god, look at our brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother?&rdquo; asked Michael. &ldquo;Who is your brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our brother,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;Cory is a Christian Fundamentalist who lives in Kansas. He&rsquo;s not as bad as Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church, but he&rsquo;s close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; agreed Michael. &ldquo;Phelps is a nut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadly, Cory might be one too,&rdquo; Bridget said. &ldquo;But he and other religious fanatics who act like him aren&rsquo;t guided by love. He is guided by fear; fear of punishment, fear of eternity, fear of exclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, how can we be guided by love?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When someone or something doesn&rsquo;t understand or share in the basic force of love, we shouldn&rsquo;t tolerate it. You have to give love to receive it,&rdquo; Bridget finished with a nod to the boy she still held. &ldquo;It can be a form of love to kill something or someone who threatens you and those you love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t that exactly what our fanatical brother says?&rdquo; Pat asked, exasperated. &ldquo;Homosexuals, Muslims, non-believers, Lady Gaga, whatever! He says they all threaten him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he kills one of them, then he is a threat,&rdquo; Bridget said. &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;s just a pain in the ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t understand the line, once you kill someone, like we are contemplating doing&ndash;&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like we already have done!&rdquo; Danni interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it that we cannot say that the person who loved that person cannot say that they killed one of us out of love?&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always the heart of the moral problem,&rdquo; Bridget said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck you is never a response made with love,&rdquo; John said, indicating Malaki. &ldquo;I know you want us to become a more perfect society, better than human, but I think everyone is right. We cannot reform or save the human race, and while we can force individuals to be changed,&rdquo; looking over at Liga who nodded slowly in recognition of John&rsquo;s compassion in this argument. &ldquo;We must acknowledge that identity death is still a death. It&rsquo;s still killing someone. We didn&rsquo;t kill the cells that constituted Manalo, Abao, and that other guy, but we killed their identities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what are you saying?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that love is our highest good, and we do not seek to kill others, even if they hate us,&rdquo; John answered, slowly salamandering over to his mate. &ldquo;But when they have killed, and not because we have bodily threatened them, we are justified in eliminating further threat to our loved ones and to our people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t feel right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killing never feels right,&rdquo; John agreed, putting an arm around his beautiful pod-mate. &ldquo;This is probably a good thing for both humans and mers. If we ever get to the point where killing no longer troubles us, we are doomed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, what do we do?&rdquo; Pat asked, lost and afraid, putting her head on John&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sleep on it,&rdquo; John said. &ldquo;Nothing needs to be done right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the boy?&rdquo; Bridget asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t let me kill my father,&rdquo; Torro said, lifting his face from Bridget&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;Then you must kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not killing anyone tonight,&rdquo; Bridget said. &ldquo;Right? That includes you. If you can&rsquo;t promise not to harm your father, at least until we say so, then we will have to tie you up again. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might let me kill my father?&rdquo; Torro asked, sitting up straighter.</p>
<p>Bridget looked to Pat and the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might,&rdquo; Pat said, shaking her head sadly.</p>
<p>Four hours after their first feeding, Annette and Bonnie both felt twenty years younger. Both still looked, more or less, like they normally did, but they felt wonderful. There were alone, the four of them, on the small, wind-blown island. Kyle had taken The Slipper and Jackson back to the mainland. They were going to finalize some documents for Bart Kolbert and to meet with some of their old friends, relatives, and a few others. They joked that it was a fishing trip on dry land. Annette and Bonnie had taken a walk outside, while Mac and Joy had swum out the tunnel and surveyed the water around the island. After about an hour of exploration, they joined Bonnie and Annette at the dock. The two humans bundled against the cold, sitting on the end of the dock, and the two mers, naked in the dark water of the bay at their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My flukes are actually touching the bottom,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only about eight feet deep here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I can just reach it,&rdquo; Joy said, her chin just clearing the choppy water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re not freezing!&rdquo; Annette exclaimed. &ldquo;It makes me cold just to look at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water is cold,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;We can feel it. It just doesn&rsquo;t make me cold. I mean, I don&rsquo;t feel cold myself, even though I can feel that the water is very cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that possible?&rdquo; Annette asked. &ldquo;Cold is one of my biggest pet peeves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mer-organs,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t all women cold?&rdquo; Bonnie teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be one shortly,&rdquo; Annette shot back. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll see who hogs the covers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be human long enough for that to happen,&rdquo; Bonnie said ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be one before you start to transition to mermaid,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll have at least one night as a full-fledged girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; Annette said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of which, what&rsquo;s our schedule?&rdquo; Bonnie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should head back in,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;Every four hours, just like a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;I thought it was once a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was when you were there,&rdquo; Annette agreed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been talking to Pat every day for the past week, and the new data suggest that each dose does its major work in the first few hours. The body can tolerate the next dose in about four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a good idea?&rdquo; Mac asked. &ldquo;I mean, we&rsquo;re a bit different from the mers out west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still mers,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t prove it to you, but I just know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, several of the mers fed more than once a day,&rdquo; Annette said, &ldquo;Starting with the second group of mers who didn&rsquo;t use the original goop Pat invented but drank from Danni and Pat themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I guess I didn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Joy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all for speeding it up,&rdquo; Bonnie said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really weird to feel one way in here,&rdquo; she said tapping her head, &ldquo;and to look a different way out here,&rdquo; she finished waving her hand over her still male body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be awful,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thousands already deal with it,&rdquo; Bonnie said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;I never thought about LGBT people before, but this experience has really opened my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it would,&rdquo; Annette agreed. &ldquo;My, what an amazing journey we are undertaking. Let&rsquo;s continue, shall we?&rdquo; she said, standing up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you in a few,&rdquo; Mac agreed, and he and Joy ducked below the dark water and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall,&rdquo; Bonnie said, standing up and taking her wife&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;As long as we&rsquo;re together, I won&rsquo;t care what I look like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only more people were like you,&rdquo; Annette said, giving him a peck on his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t always like me,&rdquo; Bonnie said. &ldquo;Mermaid milk is probably one of the most powerful things on the planet. I was a Navy man, remember? This is still strange for me, but I feel now like it must happen. I&rsquo;m going to be Mac&rsquo;s pod-mate and your lesbian lover shortly, and there&rsquo;s nothing that will stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so,&rdquo; Annette agreed, and they walked towards the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodnight, Mom,&rdquo; Rikki, Cleo, and Emma said in unison as they turned into the shallow surf and disappeared into the water. Emma Henderson watched the dark waves crash along the shore, waiting for her three daughters to join MuSu, who waited beyond the breakers for his pod-mates. After only a few seconds, my goodness those girls can swim fast now, she thought, they appeared next to their handsome mate and waved goodbye one more time. Emma waved and turned back towards the huts that were nestled along the line between the jungle and the beach. She felt a tug of anger as she glanced at the hut where Malaki lay shackled to the wall, wondering if she should break their collective promise and simply kill him where he lay.</p>
<p>No, she shook her head. Life should be sought, not death. Death would come, eventually, to all of us, no need to add her energy to its power. She instead continued her slow walk towards the hut she had been assigned. As she passed by the hut the Basras shared, she heard a sob. Poor Sudhish, he was really struggling. She changed her course and entered their dark hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emma?&rdquo; Rani asked as she entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; she replied as she lowered herself next to the girl she had often cared for over the past few months. They could all see one another dimly in the far-away light of the stars, and Vidya held Sudhish in her arms as he buried his face in her tee shirt. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sudhish,&rdquo; Rani said. &ldquo;He wants to kill Malaki.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be a long line for that one. But why is he crying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sudhish?&rdquo; Rani prompted. &ldquo;Please, tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudhish lifted his face from his sister&rsquo;s embrace and turned to Emma. Even in the darkness, Emma could tell that Sudhish looked awful. The last few days had sucked the life from his eyes and face, and he looked like the hollow shell of a man, a small man, where the slightest breeze might blow him away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m failing at keeping my honor,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you failing to keep your honor?&rdquo; Emma asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I cannot break my promise to the mers, and so I must allow this man who dishonored my family and killed my sister to live another day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I fail at everything I&rsquo;m supposed to do, and I failed to keep my loved one alive. I failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;So did I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your girls are alive!&rdquo; He protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband, their father, and the only man I ever loved, is not,&rdquo; Emma said simply. She bowed her head and fought to control her own emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip; I &hellip; but &hellip;&rdquo; he stopped, looking intently at the small woman before him, her disfigured face visible in the darkness. He suddenly felt smaller and even worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about your husband,&rdquo; he said, subdued. &ldquo;But my parents, my sisters, and my country expected me to protect my sisters. Your husband died protecting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be right,&rdquo; Emma agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to honor his sacrifice, but Geeta died protecting you and your sisters. You should honor her sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudhish thought about that for a long moment. He looked at his two sisters and then back at Emma. &ldquo;My sisters have said much the same thing,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sisters are wise,&rdquo; Emma agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They also say I should honor Geeta&rsquo;s sacrifice,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you should,&rdquo; Emma agreed. &ldquo;How will you honor Geeta&rsquo;s sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot without help,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll help you, if I can,&rdquo; she reassured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sisters have told me of your courage, your kindness, and your compassion,&rdquo; he began, sitting up straighter. &ldquo;You are the strongest person I have ever met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not any of that,&rdquo; Emma protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the strongest person I have ever met,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You can help us. If I was to become a merman, I could not be with my sisters. It would be taboo. I would fail at being a merman as I have failed at being a man. But since I have failed to fulfill my duties as a brother and a man, I can try to honor my sister&rsquo;s sacrifice by becoming her. I could fulfill her destiny, and then I could be with my sisters. Our parents are dead, and we have no one left to us in the world. Will you become our merman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emma&rsquo;s mouth dropped open. She stared back at the three Basras in shock and surprise. Of course she knew now, as did the Basras, about the stories of the other mers, particularly Michael, Gail, and Gabriel. Gender was very plastic with mers, and so she realized that she really could become their merman.</p>
<p>The question was: did she want to? She looked carefully at each of them in the darkness. Their eyes were all wet with emotion; they had talked about this already! She had to admit that Rani and Vidya were beautiful young woman, and Sudhish was an elegant young man, if a bit small for her taste. But if he was more like his sister, who was a beauty to be sure, and Emma herself was more like her husband &hellip; her heart nearly broke at that thought, and she brought her fist to her mouth to stop a sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Sudhish said, misunderstanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Emma reassured him, drawing upon the strength and steel that had gotten her this far. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t you or your request. I just &hellip; my husband, of me taking his place, honoring his sacrifice. He is &hellip; was &hellip; such a good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His goodness is easily seen in his wife and three children,&rdquo; Rani said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Emma said, deeply moved. &ldquo;Actually, for a while, I had completely forgotten that ANY man could be good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you be our good man?&rdquo; Vidya asked. &ldquo;You have a heart we trust, and Sudhish cannot bear the thought of continuing to fail as a man. He wants to succeed as a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emma thought deeply about what they were asking. She tried to imagine herself a young mermaid, making love to one of the other men she had met. Her stomach lurched again, worse than before. No, she could not be a mermaid to any man. She could become a merman for them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, a tear sliding down one of her burned and scarred cheeks. &ldquo;I will become your merman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annette and Bonnie watched as Mac and Joy acrobatically flipped from the tank to the floor below. They were both laughing like teenagers, giddy with their abilities and stamina, and both Annette and Bonnie felt a twinge of jealousy from Joy getting all the attention. Joy positioned herself next to Mac, facing him, but her hips even with his mid-tail fins. Annette scrambled to one side and flipped to her back while Bonnie went to the other and lay across Mac&rsquo;s tail to position herself under Joy&rsquo;s other breast. Mac positioned his tail so that Bonnie&rsquo;s butt was in the middle of his tail, fully supported, so that she could relax as she fed.</p>
<p>Bonnie lay for a moment on her back, and watched as Annette latched on and began feeding. She looked up and saw the fullness of Joy&rsquo;s breasts, and watched as milk began to sympathetically leak from the unattended nipple. She raised her head and took the fat nipple in her mouth, began to feed, the sweet milk filling her mouth in a constant stream. As she continued to feed, she could feel Mac shifting under her, feeling muscles in his tail clenching and releasing. She wondered what he was doing until she felt a pressure release under her butt and heard Mac sigh as he released his stiffening penis from his vent. A thrill ran up her spine as she realized that the massive cock she had seen when Joy transformed was now sticking up in the air inches from her left hip.</p>
<p>A brief, internal struggle raged through Bonnie; should she or shouldn&rsquo;t she. She would, she decided, and reached down with her left hand, keeping her lips fastened to Joy&rsquo;s breast, and groped for Mac&rsquo;s cock. She found it, and felt it jump as she touched it. She wrapped her fingers around it, and discovered that it fit nicely into her still male (mostly) hand. She gave it a squeeze of acknowledgement and then returned her hand to the side of Joy&rsquo;s breast, giving her full attention to draining her milk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hello there,&rdquo; Joy said dreamily, the hormones from the feeding affecting her. &ldquo;What brings this on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you kidding?&rdquo; Mac asked. &ldquo;Watching one of the most beautiful women I&rsquo;ve known breast feeding two other women who are going to become some of the most beautiful women I&rsquo;ll know is &hellip; is &hellip; alright by this solider!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the most beautiful women?&rdquo; Joy asked playfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sally&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; Mac said, his cock dropping a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;Sorry. We&rsquo;ll do our best to be worthy of her memory, won&rsquo;t we girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Annette and Bonnie broke from drinking, gave their assent, and then returned to drinking. Bonnie dropped her hand and gave Mac a few squeezes and strokes, restoring his cock to full attention, and then refocused on her task at Joy&rsquo;s breast. After a about ten minutes, they had drained Joy, and both of them sat up,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dessert?&rdquo; Annette asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Bonnie said, taken aback. &ldquo;OH! Yes, I think we should!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bonnie turned onto her knees and positioned herself at Mac&rsquo;s hips, just below his pelvic fin. She grasped his rampant cock with her right hand and stroked it slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so smooth and soft,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And yet so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joy indicated to Annette to give her some room, and she flipped herself around, giving Annette equal access to Mac&rsquo;s cock, rolling her hips as only a mermaid can so that her torso remained vertical even with her tail extended out behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should start focusing on us,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;Changing us as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Mac said, watching Bonnie who was still strongly resembled Brent, stroke his long cock. &ldquo;Well, my dear Annette, for you I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll do anything. You and Joy were both gorgeous, and so I&rsquo;ll just let you get younger. Bonnie, on the other hand, well I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t choose hair color and the like,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going to be brown, brown skinned, brown eyed and brown hair. But you can choose body type. Annette was the short, blond bombshell, and I was the tall, striking brunette. What should Bonnie become?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does Bonnie want to become?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bonnie doesn&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;This was never my idea in the first place, but I&rsquo;m sure that it will be wonderful when I&rsquo;m finished.&rdquo; She seemed mesmerized by Mac&rsquo;s cock, and she never took her eyes from hit as she talked. &ldquo;Just pick, but make it so all of you will like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going to love you, my dearest,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;I think you should give Bonnie Joy&rsquo;s height and stature and my curves and hips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like a great plan,&rdquo; Mac said, and he furrowed his brow as he focused on Bonnie&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oooh,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can feel that &hellip; wow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it feel like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pressure,&rdquo; Bonnie said. &ldquo;But not bad &hellip; like a gentle press of the hand, only from the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should feed from Mac,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;It speeds things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t moving fast enough?&rdquo; Bonnie said. &ldquo;Look what I&rsquo;m doing &hellip; and this morning &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I know,&rdquo; Annette said, her eyes playful. &ldquo;But you could be doing more, like this,&rdquo; she said as she lowered her lips to Mac&rsquo;s cock. She gave the large head a kiss, then a lick, and then she stuffed as much as she could into her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yessssss,&rdquo; moaned Mac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; Annette asked as she let it pop out.</p>
<p>She reached down and covered Bonnie&rsquo;s hand with her own, and then pushed the cock towards Bonnie. Bonnie lowered her own head to Mac&rsquo;s cock, and drew him into her mouth. He was huge, and salty, and musky, and male! Her senses were overwhelmed with both the feeling and the smell of what she was doing. She sucked as hard as she could, swirling her tongue around the head, moving her hand up and down along his shaft. Mac moaned again. She redoubled her efforts, using both hands and bobbing her head. His great shaft throbed in her hands. She sensed Annette kissing Mac&rsquo;s hips, fins, and stomach, while she urged him to release his siren cells so they could feed. Mac moaned again, and a great spurt exploded into her mouth. Bonnie gagged, swallowing at the same time, and sputtering. She lifted her head, keeping her hands moving along his shaft, and felt a second spurt splash on her face and chin. Annette quickly covered his cock with her mouth and took the next spurt in her mouth, the fourth spurt splashing on her face and chin as she choked down hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, that was amazing,&rdquo; Mac sighed, spent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; Joy said breathlessly as she watched Annette and Bonnie kiss and lick each other&rsquo;s faces, cleaning up the mess.</p>
<p>At first, the changes were subtle. When Kyle and Jackson returned from the mainland they hardly noticed any changes. By the third feeding later that evening, Annette and Bonnie both looked and felt years younger. Bonnie had stayed close to Mac for the entire day, allowing him to focus his mer-senses upon her as much as possible. Having given herself as intimately as was yet possible to Mac with a second blow job, Bonnie&rsquo;s internal struggle with her gender change had evaporated. Not only could she feel her connection to Mac, Joy, and Annette grow throughout the day but also her desire to truly to be the perfect mermaid-mate to all three of them.</p>
<p>She was going to be a mermaid! She also marveled at how her love for&ndash; and from&ndash;Annette felt more powerful and needful than ever before. Throughout the day Annette stayed by her side, celebrating each change as they noticed them. Annette also teased Bonnie when she was caught drooling over the chiseled outline of Mac&rsquo;s pecs, ogling the dimples at the top of her own ass, or losing herself in the amazing kaleidoscope of hazel, brown, gold, and black that were Joy&rsquo;s new eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, what are you thinking?&rdquo; Bonnie asked Mac as she stroked his mid-tail fins, watching them twitch as she tickled them. Her belly was full from their third feeding, and she could feel the siren cells move throughout her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your body,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, looking across Mac&rsquo;s tail to where Annette and Joy sat entwined in a gentle, but thorough hug. &ldquo;I can feel it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still a pressure?&rdquo; asked Annette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bonnie said. &ldquo;More like a slow, internal massage now. It&rsquo;s like I can almost feel the siren cells moving around inside me, moving stuff around. I&rsquo;m probably imagining it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not changing as dramatically as you are, my love, but I can still feel the effects. It does feel like something moving within me, but gently, not intrusively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, exactly,&rdquo; Bonnie said. She closed her eyes and tried to imagine what she would finally look like. The earlier description made sense to her, Annette&rsquo;s dramatic curves, and Joy&rsquo;s height, but she couldn&rsquo;t imagine her face. Her old face still adorned her visage, and she could not banish it from her imagination. &ldquo;What will my face look like?&rdquo; she asked, turning to look Mac in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close your eyes,&rdquo; he said. She did. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re already changing, you know. Remember those Vargas pinups from our youth?&rdquo; She nodded, a smile creeping across her lips. &ldquo;Remember how the brunettes all seemed to have a more knowing look than the blonds or redheads?&rdquo; She nodded again, noticing that her hair fell in front of her face for the first time as she did. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the look,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sort of a mishmash in my mind, but you get the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will work for me,&rdquo; Bonnie said, seeing the image in her mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;Especially since we&rsquo;re all going to be brunettes anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uuhhhhh,&rdquo; Bonnie moaned, putting a hand on her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You alright?&rdquo; Mac asked. &ldquo;Should I stop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bonnie said, grimacing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my hips, they hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all get in the water and get the weight off of Bonnie&rsquo;s bones. This happened with all the other mermaids who were men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to move,&rdquo; Bonnie said. &ldquo;Just let me be. It will be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you&rsquo;re just too stubborn for your own good,&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting in the water now. You should also take off those clothes. They aren&rsquo;t going to fit in a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bonnie shot her wife an irritated glance, &ldquo;That is exactly why I didn&rsquo;t want to go into the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been naked for the past few days. You might as well get used to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annette untangled herself from Joy and stood up, crossed to Bonnie and held out a hand. &ldquo;Come on, upsie-daisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bonne got on all fours, and everyone could see the change in her hips, they were getting wider. She reached for Annette&rsquo;s hand slowly drew herself up. She stepped back from Annette, looked at the tall, glass wall she was going to have to climb, and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clothes,&rdquo; Annette said as she shucked her own.</p>
<p>Bonnie pulled her shirt over her head and dropped it, and then released the belt on her pants, which she could clearly see no longer fit. She looked up and suddenly noticed that all eyes were upon her. She looked down at herself, and noted the changes everyone could see now that she was naked from the hips up. Her waist had risen and shrunk in diameter, her hips were wider, though in a boyish way, and her nipples were now peaked, little domes on her otherwise flat chest. Her body hair was largely gone, and her fingers and feet looked smaller and thinner. She fumbled with the catch, but when her pants were undone, she ran her fingers along the top of her pants, feeling frisky. Despite her pain, she turned around, pushing her changing ass towards the others. She wiggled her hips as she pushed the pants and boxer shorts down and then stepped out of them, naked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ta Daaaa,&rdquo; she said as she twirled back around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my,&rdquo; Annette said.</p>
<p>Bonnie&rsquo;s hands flew to her crotch and chest, feeling suddenly embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Annette said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful.&rdquo; She crossed to her husband and took Bonnie&rsquo;s arms away from her changing body. &ldquo;Like a teenage girl &hellip; with short hair &hellip; and a crooked nose.&rdquo; She gave Bonnie a playful kiss on her nose. &ldquo;Now, up and over you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a sec,&rdquo; Mac said, salamandering over to the edge of the tank and he coiling his tail underneath him. He waited for Joy to do the same, and then he grabbed hold of her hips. She nodded, and he heaved her upwards as she pushed up with her tail. She easily reached the top of the tank and in a continuous motion, pulled her hips up over her shoulders in a perfect pike position and then rolled forward into the water with a splash. A second later, Mac did the same thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can stop drooling over how strong he is,&rdquo; Annette teased. &ldquo;You go first,&rdquo; she waved to the ladder that now leaned against the glass wall on the far side of the room. She watched Bonnie ascend the ladder slowly and somewhat painfully and then tumble into the water, and then she followed.</p>
<p>Mac caught Bonnie in his embrace, effortlessly holding both their heads above the water, his pelvic and mid-tail fins waving back and forth, his flukes nearly still. Joy did the same thing for Annette. After a few moments of silence, Bonnie spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You were right. This does help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;Mac, give her your full attention!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bonnie said, &ldquo;Change me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, the mers and humans gathered on the beach once again. Pat watched as Torro emerged from the jungle, Maja and Antonia helping him as he walked on unsteady and weakened legs. He was having some difficulties in recovering from the effects of several days of mermaid venom, and now that they understood his story more fully, everyone seemed to take a liking to the troubled young man. He was still Malaki&rsquo;s son, but he was as much a victim as anyone else. The two teen-aged girls were surprisingly strong and resilient, Pat thought, as she watched them mother Torro. She wondered if that was the start of a pod.</p>
<p>She turned to watch Harold Mathews and Michael Thompson drag Malaki down to the center of the gathering mers and humans. He was now actively struggling against his bonds and cursing his captors in a steady stream of invectives in at least three or four languages. Neither Harold nor Michael seemed to show any great concern for either Malaki&rsquo;s comfort or his curses. Michael casually brought out the gag Malaki had worn the previous evening, and on Malaki&rsquo;s next fuck you, he slipped it over the smaller man&rsquo;s head. Pat smiled as Malaki&rsquo;s next string of invectives was lost in the gag as Michael tightened it firmly.</p>
<p>She looked over again at Torro and wondered why he seemed to be having such a hard time recovering when his father seemed nearly completely recovered. She watched as the two girls gently guided Torro down to the sand, seeing how he reveled in the attention. Ah, Torro &hellip; not such a difficult explanation as to his medical state. Pat smiled; Torro could probably use some positive attention, but she called Bridget over to join her. She watched as both Maja and Antonia fussed over Torro, surprising her by how innocent the three of them seemed. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be any sexual tension among them. Torro wasn&rsquo;t such a bad looking young man, slight though he was, and Maja and Antonia were both beauties, despite the wear and tear each of them wore in their eyes. Strange, she thought to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would love to be certain that Torro&rsquo;s recovery is delayed only by his desire for attention,&rdquo; she said to Bridget as her sister drew near. &ldquo;See if you can make sure he&rsquo;s actually doing alright without embarrassing him in front of his new friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got it, Sis,&rdquo; Bridget said, waving Elise to join her. The two of them salamandered over to Torro and the teenagers and started talking to them.</p>
<p>Pat then noticed Emma and the Basras all leaving from the same hut. All four of them seemed to have recovered dramatically over night. Even in clothing that wasn&rsquo;t their own, each seemed more confident than they had the previous evening. Even Sudhish, whom Pat had thought would take days or weeks to pull himself out of morning for his sister, seemed to be smiling and happy. There was a closeness among Emma, Rani, and Vidya that seemed different from the previous day. She studied Sudhish, fearful that he was thinking of becoming the pod-leader for his own sisters. No, he wasn&rsquo;t sending any of those vibes, she decided. She&rsquo;d find out after they let Malaki have his say.</p>
<p>She glanced back to check in on Danni, Liga, Petra who were currently wrangling the children. The three of them were relaxing in the surf, their tails facing the open sea, watching the children as they tumbled and frolicked in the shallow water. Maureen had fed strongly this morning, Pat mused, and she could still feel her nipples throb. Her daughter was only two months old, but she was already acting like a two or three year old human. Maureen and her sisters were babbling words and nonsense nearly non-stop, swimming and salamandering nearly everywhere, and eating like horses. Pat looked back a Malaki, and thought how much of a danger he, and so many others, might pose to her daughters. She sighed, resigned to the wisdom and primal justice of simply protecting the ones you love. Malaki showed no signs of reforming, and unlike Liga, it was not likely to be easy to change him into a loving mermaid.</p>
<p>She squared her shoulders and salamadered over to where Malaki lay trussed up in a sitting position on the sand. She looked down at him, her eyes only eight centimeters higher than his, mind you, but it was eight centimeters, and asked, &ldquo;Are you ready to be questioned?&rdquo; Malaki let loose another muffled string of curses, and Pat waited for him to finish. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll give it a shot regardless.&rdquo; She reached behind him and untied the gag, letting it fall to the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You slimey manggagaway!&rdquo; Malaki roared now that he could. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you roast in hellfire before I answer any of your questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A witch am I?&rdquo; Pat said with a smile. &ldquo;Ironic, but I guess it&rsquo;s o.k. since I invented the goop that changed your sons into dolphins. You can call me a witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a whorish sirena without a soul,&rdquo; Malaki continued. &ldquo;Bruha! Pokpok!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sticks and stones,&rdquo; said Pat brightly. &ldquo;Just let me know when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malaki kept up a steady and creative stream of curses and sexual assaults for the next ten minutes. Pat simply smiled and let him rant and rave, marveling at Malaki&rsquo;s capacity for anger and name-calling. When he finally stopped, she waited a full minute, daring him to start back up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malaki Dimaunahan, you have been accused of murder, extortion, prostitution, drug trafficking, bribery, and crimes against humanity,&rdquo; Pat said with an official voice. &ldquo;How do you plead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putanginamo!&rdquo; he spat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fuck you in any language is still a fuck you,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John salamandered over and reinserted the gag as Malaki protested loudly. When he was finished, he gave Malaki an energetic thump on the back that nearly knocked him over and said, &ldquo;Well played, asshole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the absence of any reasonable testimony from the accused, can we agree to let yesterday&rsquo;s accounts from Emma, Sudhish, Rani, Vidya, Maja, Antonia, and Torro stand?&rdquo; she asked the throng. Everyone gave his or her assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should be his punishment?&rdquo; Pat asked. After a moment of awkward and heavy silence, Emma finally said, &ldquo;Death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t have any hemlock handy,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;So, we&rsquo;ll need to decide how we are to do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Torro said. &ldquo;Do not kill him. I wish to honor my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you wish to do that?&rdquo; Pat asked. &ldquo;Wait, YOU don&rsquo;t want to kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Torro stood up, showing a remarkable recovery from the mermaid venom in the last few minutes. He walked over to his bound and gagged father, squatting before him. His father met his gaze with unabashed hatred. He looked into Malaki&rsquo;s eyes for several seconds before turning away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think his greatest fear is to no longer be a man,&rdquo; Torro began. &ldquo;A man as he understands such a thing to be. I think that his version of a man is an abomination, and I have no wish to continue to be my father&rsquo;s son. My father should be punished, yes. But first, he should witness his only remaining son become a woman, and then a mermaid. The last of his line will disappear from the face of the earth, and my mother will be remembered in my new form. I want this vision to torment him for the rest of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat took a deep breath. She had underestimated this young man, and she saw how elegantly Torro met both the need to escape from and to punish his father in this course of action. She salamandered over to him and took his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice guided by love,&rdquo; she said, giving him a squeeze. &ldquo;Welcome to our Island, Torro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, no longer am I his son,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Please call me Valencia. That was my mother&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Valencia,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>There was a pause as the two of them simply looked at one another, and then they realized that something had changed. Both the mermaid and the boy turned to look at Malaki, who was both silent and still for the first time that morning. His eyes were wide with shock, wonder, and horror as he stared at his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Valencia,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;You finally got him to shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The past two and a half days had brought about dramatic changes on Taylor&rsquo;s Island, the Baker homestead. In the house above, Jack had completed the paperwork to hand over the title and deed to his land to the MMI.</p>
<p>He and Kyle had assembled a list of six people who added essential skills or knowledge bases to the mer population and who were willing to embark upon an adventure with precious few details other than the promise of vitality and a fresh start. They had just finished up the last of the paperwork as dusk settled over the island and were headed down to the tank.</p>
<p>In the tank below, Annette and Bonnie had fully revitalized to their midtwenties, developed gills, and had webbing up to their second knuckles. As they stood in front of the tank wall, naked, they compared themselves in their reflections in the glass. Annette was fully restored to her blond bombshell status, a petite and curvy woman with generous hips and slender shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yup. Liv Lindeland,&rdquo; Kyle said as he and Jackson entered and took in the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see it now,&rdquo; Jack agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annette is far prettier than that old hag,&rdquo; Mac said, his chin resting on his hands at the top of the glass wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about me?&rdquo; Bonnie asked into the reflection in the glass wall. &ldquo;Who do I look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men looked at the dramatic beauty into which the former navy man had been transformed. Bonnie&rsquo;s long legs were both graceful and powerful, and they supported a lovely heart-shaped ass that was neither too wide nor too narrow. Her waist was dramatically smaller, however, which made her hips look wider than they were. Above her small waist hung two perfect breasts, which would have done a bullet bra justice. Her face had a strong chin, elegant neck, generous smile, large expressive eyes, dramatically arched eyebrows, and a thick mane of curly brown hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t rightly say,&rdquo; Kyle said, adjusting his pants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s like a pin up right out of memory,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She reminds me of Irish McCalla,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet that was a favorite of yours when you were a kid,&rdquo; she said to Mac.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that you mention it,&rdquo; Mac said, appraising the beauty below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheena of the Sea! I&rsquo;m not sure if I should be jealous or madly in love,&rdquo; Annette said, looking over her former husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please choose B,&rdquo; Bonnie said, her voice dripping with the promise of pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We better get you two in the tank before Jack and Kyle have a meltdown,&rdquo; Joy said from her perch on the top of the glass wall.</p>
<p>Bonnie looked over her shoulder, giving the two men a very knowing and deliberate Lauren Bacall look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You boys need anything?&rdquo; she asked. Both men just shook their heads, not trusting their voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, if you are ready my dear,&rdquo; Bonnie motioned to Annette that she could climb the ladder first.</p>
<p>Joy gracefully slipped back into the tank as the two girls climbed in after her. Kyle and Jack both felt the sexual tension in the room dissipate, and they shared a grin of embarrassment. They watched both girls feed from first Joy and then Mac. After they shared the fruits of Mac&rsquo;s enormous orgasm, they both grew stiff and assumed the transformational position. Bubbles started to roil around them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Kyle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac and Joy, they&rsquo;re humming,&rdquo; Jack answered, transfixed by the beauty and power of the scene before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Kyle said, looking at the skylight above. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not humming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked up as well. The evening sky was clear and bright in the skylights several stories above their heads. The slowly growing sound of helicopter blades beating the air broke the sound of soft, harmonic humming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds close,&rdquo; Kyle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too close,&rdquo; Jack growled. He glanced over at the tank. The mers and proto-mers were all spinning gracefully in the center of the tank, and the fish were performing their usual merry-go-round accompaniment. They were oblivious, and he was going to do whatever it took to keep it that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think we should do?&rdquo; Kyle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; Jack said as he walked over to a wall panel near the pump room. He opened a panel and flipped down a computer screen and keyboard. He waited for the computer to boot up as they both listened to the choppers get closer and closer. They could now hear the faint whine of marine motors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got boats too,&rdquo; Kyle said. &ldquo;This is big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems so,&rdquo; Jack agreed, focused on the computer screen. It finally loaded, and his fingers flew over the keyboard. After a few seconds, a Homeland Security page appeared and asked for a password. Jack typed one in, and hit enter. Another page loaded, and he scrolled down and entered a code in one of the search bars. A new page loaded, and he scrolled down the list that appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang it,&rdquo; Jack said, as though he had forgotten bread at the grocery store. &ldquo;I shoulda known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoulda known what?&rdquo; Kyle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been more circumspect in contacting the MMI,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hows that?&rdquo; Kyle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A multi-million dollar transfer of assets and property to an multinational entity,&rdquo; Jack said, closing that window and opening another. &ldquo;Done by a man who has a national security clearance and a past relationship with the CIA.&rdquo; He entered another set of passwords into a new screen and waited for it to load. &ldquo;Probably should have thought that one out more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yup,&rdquo; Kyle agreed, peering over his shoulder trying to see what Jack was doing. &ldquo;Spilt milk, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yup,&rdquo; Jack agreed. He glanced over his shoulder at the tank. He couldn&rsquo;t tell if Annette and Bonnie were progressing faster, but he knew that they were going to take longer than he likely had. The computer chirped, and he turned to look at the screen. A video display showed four views from the house along each of the cardinal directions. Nothing showed in the screens until Jack&rsquo;s fingers flew over the keys, altering the filters on the cameras. As the green tinted images came into focus, they could see two military grade helicopters with no marking and two naval river patrol boats without marking, coming in from the west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not good,&rdquo; Kyle said, seeing the video.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seal it off, and don&rsquo;t let anyone in unless it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; Jack said as he turned away from the computer and headed for the passageway up to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Kyle stopped him. &ldquo;If this is as bad as it looks, then you are more likely to get me out of a jam that I am to help you. I should go up there. I&rsquo;ll say that I&rsquo;m just watching the place until you get back. I&rsquo;m just a local, and I can play the dumb card for a good long while. They can try to tear this place apart, and eventually they&rsquo;ll get tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annette isn&rsquo;t the only person who knows about this tank,&rdquo; Jack said heavily. &ldquo;Some one will know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, but it will take several days to pry the place open if you seal it up,&rdquo; Kyle said. &ldquo;Right? That&rsquo;s the way you designed this darn place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;You might be risking &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn sure,&rdquo; Kyle said. &ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t let me rot in some cell for very long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;Well &hellip; um &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of that,&rdquo; Kyle said, brushing past him. &ldquo;Just seal it up. I&rsquo;ll see you in a bit.&rdquo; He turned to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;You probably have a few minutes; destroy and shred as much paper work as you can, but don&rsquo;t wait too long, so as you don&rsquo;t look like you were doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yup,&rdquo; Kyle said. He marched out of the room and up the passageway and then into the basement of the house.</p>
<p>As soon as the indicator light showed that the basement door was secure, Jack returned to the computer and brought up a new screen. He entered a user-name and password, and then started to select a series of options from a long list of radial buttons. He brought the video screen back to the front, calculated how much time he had, and then returned to the other screen, scrolled to the bottom of the page and selected an override button. He scrolled through the long page, checking each of the options the computer had entered automatically. He sighed and hit &ldquo;enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deep within the pump room a series of hydraulic valves clicked open, allowing pressurized oil to feed into the reinforced hoses connected to those valves. After a moment, at the juncture of the ceiling and the bottom of the false chicken shed above, a nearly two foot thick slab of iron and concrete began inching across the opening. The top of the slab was covered in old hay and sawdust, dried chicken poop, and some rusting tools. A few seconds later, a thick iron door that needed no camouflage began sliding horizontally across the entrance to the passageway, sealing off that route.</p>
<p>Jack moved to his left and opened the panel that controlled the sea locks on the filter and access tunnels and flipped a switch, lowering two sets of iron gates, ones at the very end of the tunnels camouflaged to look like the rocks and mud of the bed of the bay, and a second set near the mid-points of each tunnel were simply iron bars that allowed the water to pass but nothing larger than a crab. When the indicator lights showed that the room was sealed, he returned to his computer and opened yet another window.</p>
<p>He entered another user-name and password, composed a short message, and then added several email addresses to the blind-copy-send field. He launched a tracer program and keyed it to the message, and then sent the message, watching the tracer program&rsquo;s window track its progress. When he saw that the message had made it to the public server at the University of Maryland, he closed those programs, opened a new window, and logged onto his local network. He locked down all the computers in the house above in safe mode but left them running. He returned to the video feed and checked the progress of the approaching helicopters and boats.
