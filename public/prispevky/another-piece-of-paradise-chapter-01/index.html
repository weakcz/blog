            <p>This is a work of fiction (unfortunately). It may also contain themes and opinions that some may find objectionable. If you underage, then stop now. I&rsquo;m writing in the universe of Patricia&rsquo;s &ldquo;Changes in Paradise,&rdquo; If you have not read her magnum opus, and are interested in mermaids, then you should go right over to the Mermaid Stories group on Yahoo and read them post haste. This story assumes that you have some understanding of her fantastic vision of mers. I&rsquo;d like to thank her for expending so much time, energy, and thought on her story; it&rsquo;s what inspired me to start writing. I&rsquo;d also like to thank her for her permission to write in her domain, and her outstanding suggestions and ideas for the story. I&rsquo;d like to thank Len and Patrick for their input and work proofreading my grammar and spelling. Several of Patricia&rsquo;s characters make cameos here, but I&rsquo;ve tried to keep that to a minimum as I focus on &ldquo;my&rdquo; pod.</p>
<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flight 1138 to Suva, now boarding at gate 23,&rdquo; said the voice, first in English, then in Mandarin, as the sea of humanity made its way through the gleaming Hong Kong airport. Within that mass of humanity, a large American made his way through the crowd of mostly Asian travelers. At six feet, seven inches, Josh Abramson fairly towered above his fellow travelers. Josh was on his way to a week of sun, sand, and relaxation. Relaxation from his job leading a training software development team in the autocratic state of Singapore. Relaxation from the security cameras, speech laws, and a draconian judicial system. This wasn&rsquo;t as nice as going home to Pennsylvania coal country and seeing his parents and brothers, but it would have to do until he could get some more time off. He picked up the pace as he headed towards his gate. As he thought about the tropical paradise he was headed to, the childhood fantasy he kept to himself crossed his mind: Fiji might even be a good place to see a merhis thought was interrupted by his crashing into a middle-aged western woman with short brown hair and brown eyes as she struggled with her luggage. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he muttered apologetically as he helped the woman with her carry-on. The stranger finished taking her things and hurried off without a word. Josh sighed, gathered his things and after making sure everything was there; he stopped at a vendor for a drink.</p>
<p>Sarah Mendelson walked briskly off towards her flight to Suva after she&rsquo;d been nearly run down by the big man. She looked back at him as he stopped to buy a bottle of water. I have to run off to a vacation spot to stroke some client&rsquo;s ego, where I&rsquo;ll be the only one not relaxing, and I get run down in the airport. Sarah was VP of sales for East Asia for a major semiconductor manufacturing equipment firm. She&rsquo;d spent 20 plus years building her company&rsquo;s presence in the byzantine labyrinth of patronage, nationalist trade regulation, ethnic tension, family loyalties and public/private cronyism that make up doing business in this part of the world, and even as an American, she had not only survived, but thrived through her quick wit and ability to be forceful while not breaching protocol in the myriad countries she did business in. Such a demanding life had left no time for family though, and at 47 she had resigned herself to the fact that she would neither have a husband nor children, much to the chagrin of her now-dead parents. She hadn&rsquo;t even talked to her younger brother in 5 years. No reason really, she was just too busy. She pushed the thought out of her head as she boarded the plane and headed for her seat in business class. She immediately sat down and pulled out her client info to get ready for the meeting. She hadn&rsquo;t endured being harassed and hit on by Asian businessmen who should know better, while building her company&rsquo;s clientele to let an economic recession bring it all down, even if she did have to fly off to badger a Korean tycoon on his vacation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on Miki, we&rsquo;re going to miss the flight,&rdquo; Manami Iwamura said as her 21 year old sister browsed the snack offerings at the kiosk. Manami was the practical one, and at 25, she had had a bit more experience than her still-in-school younger sister. Miki was the dreamer, the lighthearted girl who wanted to enjoy all that life had to offer. She had convinced Manami to take a vacation from her corporate job while Miki had a break from school. Manami had only agreed to go along after their parents asked to look after her sister while Miki had fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry,&rdquo; Miki said as she started from her reverie and turned away from the wide selection of snacks and drinks. She quickly selected something and paid for it, and the two sisters hurried off towards the terminal. Each about five feet tall, with the long dark hair and almond shaped eyes common among their countrymen, both girls even wore an identical pendant of the Wheel of Karma around their necks, a gift from their grandparents. They were sometimes mistaken for twins, even though Manami was four years older. They hurried towards the gate, and Manami noticed a blonde-haired girl buying snacks. She was a rare sight in East Asia, despite the increase in international travel. The girl smiled at her as their eyes met, and Manami politely smiled back and continued on her way,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; Miki asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I was just being polite,&rdquo; Manami responded, and continued onto the gate where they found their seats toward the rear of coach.</p>
<p>Jenna Swanton smiled at the Japanese woman as she went by. Jenna&rsquo;s honey blonde hair, tall, coltish good looks, ice blue eyes and girl next door charm had always garnered her attention, but never so much as these past 6 months teaching English in Pusan, South Korea. One man had even asked her to marry him in the middle of the street. She&rsquo;d signed on right after graduating from Ole Miss in Oxford with a degree in English. She&rsquo;d thought it would be a great experience, having grown up in a small town in Mississippi without much more than TV and the Internet to tell her about the world. She also wanted to get out in the wider world while she was young, before graduate school and a possible family took all her time. She still smiled at her supervisor&rsquo;s concern that her classes would produce dozens of Koreans speaking English with her honey-thick southern accent. She was doing a good job, though, and her students seemed happy. Even though there were all sorts of opportunities for cultural enrichment in this part of the world, she was really a beach girl at heart, and Pusan just didn&rsquo;t have the warm sand and surf that she remembered from the Gulf Coast during her childhood. So it was off to Fiji for some sun and fun. She wished that she had a companion going with her, but her friend Karen hadn&rsquo;t been able to afford it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll meet someone flying solo&hellip; she thought optimistically. She paid for her snacks and headed to the plane, taking her seat by the window in coach, later she was joined by a nice Indonesian couple on their way to Fiji for a getaway.</p>
<p>As Josh settled into his bulkhead seat, he was gratified that the middle seat was unoccupied. It would lessen the sardine-in-a-can feeling the big man got when on an airliner. He took out a book and began to read, waiting for the plane to take off so that he could use his music player. He looked around the interior of the Airbus A350: All this, built by the cheapest Frenchmen they could find. He pushed the thought aside as the plane began rolling down the runway, 158 people headed for paradise on one of the thousands of flights that take place every day around the world.</p>
<p>Three hours into the flight, the meals had been served, and the passengers were watching the in-flight movie or entertaining themselves in other ways. Sarah was finished with her meeting prep, but was still working over the in-flight wireless internet that was newly installed on commercial airliners, refusing for a moment to have any downtime in her relentless pursuit of sales. Jenna had met someone alright, although not the &ldquo;someone&rdquo; she was hoping for. She was stuck listening politely to an Indonesian woman talk to her about how much Jenna would love her youngest son. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make such beautiful children with him,&rdquo; she gushed as she showed Jenna pictures and talked about how much she&rsquo;d love being a Muslim and just staying home with the other women in the large extended family. Jenna just smiled politely and tried to think of an excuse to go to the bathroom again, and seeing that both lavatories were occupied, realized that she was stuck with this woman. She smiled politely and deflected another question about contact information for her parents so the two fathers could arrange things and silently prayed that this woman would eventually run out of energy. Her husband was already snoring away, blissfully unaware of his wife&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>Manami and Miki were seated next to a nice older Chinese woman, her husband just across the aisle. The older lady didn&rsquo;t say much, so the Japanese sisters talked amongst themselves until they decided to take a nap. Josh had taken out his media player, removed his glasses (he preferred them to contacts for the dry air of the cabin), and was now dozing off to the dulcet tones of Mozart.</p>
<p>Josh was jolted awake by the sudden lurching of the plane. He thought it was just a bad case of turbulence, but he&rsquo;d never heard the metal of the plane screech like this before, or the oxygen masks drop, or the lights flicker. He heard people screaming, the engines of the plane screaming with effort trying to stay aloft, everything screaming everywhere&hellip; and then a huge roar, the plane tilted down for a long time, then leveled off again, huge arcs of flame shooting down the aisle and above his head, they singed him before he got into the crash position. The plane impacted the sea and skipped, and started falling apart, he saw a piece of debris go into the head of the woman across the aisle who hadn&rsquo;t put her head down yet, and the bulkhead in front of him tore away. His row of seats tore loose and cart wheeled, hitting the water and beginning to sink. Josh unhooked his seat belt as soon as he realized what was going on. He surfaced on an angry sea, a hellish scene of rolling waves, debris, rain, lightning and fire. He dodged floating debris before it could smash into him, but he knew he couldn&rsquo;t last long. In later years, he would wonder at the providence of what happened next.</p>
<p>Just as he thought he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep himself above water, an orange bundle about four feet long floated by. Grabbing it, he found a ripcord. Figuring he had nothing to lose, he pulled it. A CO2 canister fired, inflating the raft, which smacked him in the face, nearly pushing him away as it began to inflate. It was a large, heavy duty survival raft with an integrated canopy and a zippered door flap to protect the occupants. Nursing a hurt nose, he was about to get in the raft, when he heard a cry barely audible over the roar of the storm. A small woman was holding onto a piece of debris and an older woman at the same time. He had no idea how she was doing it, and it didn&rsquo;t look like she would be able to hold on long. He paddled the raft with his hands as quickly as he could. It seemed agonizingly slow, but he first pulled the unconscious woman onto the raft, and then reached for the Japanese girl. As he did so, the debris rolled over and the edge of the aluminum framing clobbered the woman on the right side of her head. Josh had to grab her quickly, and haul both the now unconscious, bleeding girl and then himself into the raft. His strength and adrenaline were beginning to wane. He did know that he needed to close the flap on the tent of the survival raft, or it would flood and capsize. He reached for and found the zipper, and taking one last look out of the doorway saw no one else to be saved, and was starting to zipper the flap closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he heard from the side of the door. He had missed someone along the side of the raft. She was a young woman, covered in oil and bleeding. She held a white knuckle grip along the side of the raft and her blue eyes were as wide as saucers. He grabbed her wrists and pulled her around to the front of the raft and through the door opening. Satisfied that there was really no one else, he finally closed off the raft from the storm outside.</p>
<p>His heart pounding, he finally started to come to his senses, he felt incredibly tired, and not being in the best of shape, he had overexerted himself, and was fading fast. His vision was blurry, his glasses long gone, everything hurt, and he thought he could hear the blonde girl yelling something to him, but he was insensate, and he quickly lost consciousness as the raft heaved and pitched in the huge swells.</p>
<p>Josh bolted upright with a gasp, he immediately felt pain everywhere. He realized that he was on the raft. The survival raft that he&rsquo;d managed to crawl into in the chaos following the plane hitting the water. The storm was over, the sun was low in the sky, and they floated in a debris field, pieces of the plane, luggage, and even a few bodies were floating around their raft. The raft at least served to keep the harsh tropical sun off of the occupants. He didn&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;d lived, but he&rsquo;d pulled a few people into the raft with him. There was a pretty blonde girl looking at him, she was holding her arm, with an older brown-haired woman unconscious next to the Asian girl, who was also unresponsive, and looked ashen, though her head wound had been bandaged. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he said to her, really having no idea what to say in this situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Jenna returned quietly, a look of fear in her eyes. Josh could see that she was scared. Aside from having been in a plane crash hours before, she was on a raft, with nothing to defend herself, and there was a very large man looking at her. &ldquo;You were yelling, I couldn&rsquo;t wake you up,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Josh replied. He paused, looking over the young woman. &ldquo;That arm looks bad,&rdquo; he stated as he nodded towards her bloody left arm. He proceeded to tear strips of cloth from his shirt sleeves and went to tie them around her upper arm as a bandage. He stopped when she drew back. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt you; just let me put a bandage on that wound.&rdquo; she looked at him hard, and then let him tie a bandage around her arm. &ldquo;Just keep the pressure on it, and you&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jenna,&rdquo; she said, being put a little more at ease by his kindness&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josh,&rdquo; was the man&rsquo;s reply. He checked the pulses of the two unconscious women. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re still alive at least. Good job on the bandages,&rdquo; Josh complimented on the work Jenna had done bandaging the most severe of Sarah and Manami&rsquo;s wounds with cloth from her own clothing. &ldquo;Have you seen anything that looks like water or food? Or anyone else who&rsquo;s alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bag over there, I haven&rsquo;t looked in it yet,&rdquo; replied Jenna. Josh opened the bag, and found some freeze-dried food bars, a signal mirror, a couple of survival blankets, a flare gun with three flares, and most importantly, a water purifier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It says you fill it through the red opening into this bag, and it filters the water without pumping, and you drink it out of the green opening in this bag,&rdquo; he reported, reading the included instructions. &ldquo;It only makes half a liter every five hours, and the filter only lasts for ten liters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; Jenna asked in a panicky voice. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no replacement filters or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; came his somber reply. &ldquo;This is it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fill it then,&rdquo; Jenna sighed, collecting herself.</p>
<p>Josh handed her the bag and she filled the purifier&rsquo;s red portal with seawater, and then hung it up with its strap on the inside of the raft&rsquo;s canopy to begin filtering the water that hopefully would keep them alive until rescue came. Even with the water, their situation was dire. They didn&rsquo;t have much food, they couldn&rsquo;t tell what internal injuries the other women might have, or even if they&rsquo;d regain consciousness, they didn&rsquo;t know their location, or even have a radio to call for help if they did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With any luck, the emergency beacon went off as the plane went down, and there&rsquo;s a search on the way,&rdquo; Josh said as he tried to console Jenna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I know,&rdquo; Jenna said as she teared up in despair at their situation. &ldquo;You really think that?&rdquo; she asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no choice but to think that. The alternative is&hellip;&rdquo; His voice trailed off, in order to avoid stating the obvious. When the water ran out, their skin would degrade, their tongues would swell and crack, they&rsquo;d become delusional, and be wracked with pain before finally losing consciousness and dying. It was a slow way to die, and not something to look forward to.</p>
<p>They drifted for a few hours; the seas were calm at least. Josh and Jenna alternated from staring at each other to looking out for other survivors. &ldquo;She was with someone,&rdquo; Jenna said sullenly while motioning towards Manami. &ldquo;They looked like sisters. I wonder if she made it..,&rdquo; she trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just hope they both wake up. If they have concussions, being unconscious is dangerous,&rdquo; Josh replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d y&rsquo;all get them into the raft? I mean, I swam over, grabbed onto the side and you pulled me in and closed the flap, but they were already here,&rdquo; Jenna asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On adrenaline. I&rsquo;m really impressed with her,&rdquo; he said as he pointed at Manami. &ldquo;She was holding onto a floating piece of the plane and the other woman, and got knocked out as I pulled them into the raft. I have no idea how she held on. Finding this thing was pure luck, anyway. I didn&rsquo;t even know they put these heavy survival rafts on airplanes,&rdquo; Josh admitted. &ldquo;Were you with anyone on the plane?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really. There was a married couple in the same row as me, but&hellip; they didn&rsquo;t make it,&rdquo; Jenna almost sobbed at that. The lady that was trying to arrange a marriage between Jenna and her son wasn&rsquo;t a bad sort, she didn&rsquo;t deserve to die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Sarah said as she stirred. She put her hand to her head as it pounded from whatever had hit it as the plane crashed. She didn&rsquo;t know where she was. She&rsquo;d been hit when the plane went down, and now her head was still foggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; said Jenna. &ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-who are you?&rdquo; Sarah asked. She tried to sit up quickly, but in doing so became so queasy she almost vomited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Josh, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a huge bump on your head, and I think a concussion, so try not to move, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? What happened?&rdquo; she demanded. Sarah&rsquo;s head was spinning, and she knew she wasn&rsquo;t on the plane anymore, but not much else. She saw two people staring at her, and a lot of orange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jenna, this is, Josh, right?&rdquo; Jenna said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, Josh Abramson. The plane went down, the other girl next to you held onto you and helped get you into this raft,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sarah. Where are we?&rdquo; asked Sarah, still confused, but starting to come around more and more, if only the raft would stop spinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere in the South Pacific, between Hong Kong and Fiji,&rdquo; Jenna answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was hoping you wouldn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Sarah said, holding her head. &ldquo;Could I get some water, I know we need to ration it but-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re running it through the filter now, but it looks like there&rsquo;s enough to give you a drink,&rdquo; replied Jenna as she took the filter bag down from the makeshift hanger she&rsquo;d placed it on. Sarah took a few sips of the warm water and handed it back to Jenna so that it could complete the filter cycle.</p>
<p>Josh opened the zipper on the raft door to let the morning light in, and to air out the raft. He wished he hadn&rsquo;t. There were dead bodies, luggage, bits of aircraft, and a few things he couldn&rsquo;t identify floating all around the raft. The heavier mechanical parts like the engines had already sunk. The sun was already starting to shine brightly, and the day would be a scorcher out on the tropical water. He and Jenna surveyed the area looking for any signs of life. Jenna suddenly pointed and said &ldquo;There,&rdquo; They could see a man slowly paddling towards their raft. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; Jenna called to him. The man stopped and looked up, and a smile broke out on his face. He looked like a small Vietnamese man, maybe in his 40&rsquo;s. He waved back and quickly started swimming towards the raft. Josh helped him into the raft, and he quickly started nodding his head, smiling, and talking excitedly in a language only he understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C?m ?n b?n r?t nhi?u! Tôi có th? có m?t s? n??c? B?n là ng??i ??u tiên tôi ?ã nhìn th?y!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you speak English?&rdquo; Josh asked. The man simply looked confused in response and started speaking again. Josh put his hand to his chest when he stopped and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Josh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked a little confused, then put his hand to his own chest and said, &ldquo;Pham Na.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh nodded his head, pointed to Jenna and said, &ldquo;Jenna,&rdquo; then pointed towards Sarah and said, &ldquo;Sarah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose either of you know whatever he&rsquo;s speaking?&rdquo; Josh asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, though it could be Vietnamese, but I can&rsquo;t even ask for the bathroom in that language yet,&rdquo; replied the businesswoman.</p>
<p>Their new friend then pointed to Manami. &ldquo;Có gì sai v?i cô ?y?&rdquo; and made a questioning look towards Josh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we don&rsquo;t know yet, she&rsquo;s still asleep,&rdquo; Josh said too loudly, making the common mistake of thinking that volume would impart understanding. He also made a gesture of using his hands as a pillow as if he were asleep. Pham seemed to get the idea, and with a slightly annoyed look settled down on the raft, and took off his shirt for it to dry off.</p>
<p>They continued like this for the rest of the day. They would take turns taking sips from the water filter, each of them watching the others, not really trusting each other, but at least there hadn&rsquo;t been any disagreements over the water supply between the four conscious survivors. The problem started when Jenna went to give water to the unconscious Manami as they split two of the protein bars for their dinner. Pham Na suddenly got very excited, trying to pull Jenna away from the unconscious Japanese woman and take the water away. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Josh interjected. &ldquo;She gets water,&rdquo; he repeated, his eyes narrowing, with his large hand on Pham Na&rsquo;s wrist, pulling his arm away from Jenna. The smaller man spoke quickly, at one point making a throat-slashing motion, which the American survivors took to mean that he thought Manami was all but dead, and that they shouldn&rsquo;t give her water. Pham Na backed off that time, but his expression and body language told them that he was not happy over Josh stopping him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Sarah,&rdquo; Jenna said after Pham Na had calmed down and she had given water to Manami, who was beginning to stir occasionally, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should sleep tonight. With a concussion, you might stop breathing if you sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I think it&rsquo;s been long enough that I&rsquo;ll be okay. Keep an eye on her though,&rdquo; Sarah said, indicating the small Japanese woman, who despite the small moans and groans she was making, was not coming any closer to waking up.</p>
<p>By the time the sun was approaching the western horizon, the five survivors weren&rsquo;t feeling any better about their situation. Sarah and Jenna tried to lie down over towards Manami and away from the men, while Pham Na and Josh propped themselves up against the canopy of the raft on the opposite side. As the night began to close in on them, Jenna turned to Sarah, looking for reassurance from the confident older woman. &ldquo;You think they&rsquo;ll find us?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Sarah rolled over, and despite her earlier protestations that she was fine; Jenna could hear the strain in her voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It depends on where we are and who responds. If we&rsquo;re closer to Australia or Fiji, maybe. If we went down farther north, there may not be anyone able to get here or detect the crash,&rdquo; Sarah said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josh said the plane had a beacon,&rdquo; Jenna replied in high-pitched voice. Her face showed that she was worried, and if Sarah could have seen it in the darkness, she would have seen the look of a very frightened, very worried young woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may very well have had one, it may have even worked, but whether anyone finds us is another matter. It&rsquo;s a big ocean. Try to get some sleep, getting all upset won&rsquo;t help,&rdquo; Sarah said, putting on her &ldquo;management voice&rdquo; as best she could.</p>
<p>Taking the hint, Jenna rolled over, closed her eyes and tried to focus on the peaceful sounds of the calm water lapping at the sides of their octagonal raft. She didn&rsquo;t know how long it took, exactly, but sleep did come at last.</p>
<p>Sarah was awoken by two things the next morning, the first was the sun as it streaked into the raft&rsquo;s open doorway, and the second was the fact that a Japanese woman was nudging her shoulder with a desperate look on her face. &ldquo;Wha&ndash;?&rdquo; Sarah mumbled as she rose and the pounding in her head started anew. She could swear it was getting worse, but she forced herself up when she saw who was shaking her awake. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she said weakly, &ldquo;Good to see you up, we were getting worried,&rdquo; she paused as the young woman stared at her apprehensively, &ldquo;Do you speak English?&rdquo; Sarah asked, with a sympathetic tone. Her Japanese companion simply nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see my sister?&rdquo; the girl whispered. &ldquo;We were on the plane together, and got separated as it crashed. I found you, and grabbing his arm was the last thing I remember,&rdquo; Manami said as she pointed at Josh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sweetie, I haven&rsquo;t seen her,&rdquo; Sarah said quietly, in order to avoid both waking the survivors that were sleeping and to avoid aggravating the headache she had. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name? I&rsquo;m Sarah,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manami,&rdquo; replied the young woman, a look of trepidation in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be hungry, there are some energy bars in that box over there, and there is some water, though take it easy on that,&rdquo; offered Sarah as her companion picked through the survival kit&hellip; &ldquo;Josh, that guy, told me that you held onto me after the plane went down. Thank you,&rdquo; the older woman said, watching as Manami devoured an energy bar and took a gulp of water. The young woman hadn&rsquo;t eaten in almost 40 hours, and felt ravenous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; Manami replied through a mouthful of food.</p>
<p>By this time the sun was strong enough to really start heating the raft, the other inhabitants of their raft began waking up. Josh and Jenna greeted Manami, who responded only tepidly to Josh, while Pham Na just stared at her, clearly mistrusting these four people who he couldn&rsquo;t communicate with. &ldquo;Has anyone seen my sister? She looks like me, maybe a little younger,&rdquo; Manami asked again, starting to become more and more upset as she desperately looked out over the water, which was strewn with debris and even a few bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sorry, but we haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Jenna. &ldquo;I saw you in the airport; she was the girl with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, her name is Miki,&rdquo; Manami replied, as if saying her sister&rsquo;s name could help find her. &ldquo;I tried to hold onto her, but our seats broke and we got separated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The comment hung there a moment; everyone just uncomfortably sat looking at each other. Eventually Jenna put her hand on Manami&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;If we found a raft, so could she,&rdquo; The blonde tried to reassure her. Manami gave her an uncertain look, but seemed to calm down.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, the survivors tried to keep themselves busy. They each inventoried the supplies at least five times. Partially out of boredom, and partially because of her outgoing nature, Jenna decided to strike up a conversation, at least amongst those survivors who could understand her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, where all y&rsquo;all from?&rdquo; she said with a forced cheerfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pennsylvania, though I live in Singapore for my job,&rdquo; Josh replied. &ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little place called Pass Christian, Mississippi. I went to school at Ole Miss in Oxford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing out here?&rdquo; Josh asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I teach English in Korea. Fun job, but I wanted to take a vacation somewhere warmer,&rdquo; Jenna replied. Attention then turned to Sarah, next around the circumference of the raft. She almost visibly drew into herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on Sarah, it&rsquo;ll help pass the time,&rdquo; Jenna encouraged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; The older woman finally relented. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m head of sales for a company that sells machines that make semiconductor chips. I live in Taipei. I&rsquo;m not married,&rdquo; she concluded, her tone of voice made it clear that she was just going through the motions to get Jenna to get off her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, how about you Manami?&rdquo; Jenna kept going, trying to keep up the morale of the denizens of their little raft. Manami was silent; she turned away from the others and curled up in a fetal position against the outer edge of the raft. &ldquo;Manami, are you okay?&rdquo; Jenna asked, gently placing her hand on the smaller woman&rsquo;s shoulder. No answer was forthcoming but soft sobbing. Jenna finally relented and moved away from her.</p>
<p>Conversation quickly stopped, and the survivors eventually got tired of staring at each other, and as the heat of the day dragged on, Josh decided to see if they could catch fish to bolster their food stocks. Making a serviceable fishing line from cloth scraps and using a safety pin from the survival kit as an improvised hook, they tried to see if there were any small fish taking refuge under their raft or the other pieces of flotsam. Surveying the area around the raft, they noticed the bodies still floating in the area. &ldquo;Oh G-d,&rdquo; Jenna said, tears welling up, survivors' guilt beginning to overwhelm her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing you could&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; Josh tried to comfort her. He hesitated, and then gently put his hand on her shoulder to comfort her. She jerked her head around towards him, then looked at his face and saw that he was trying to help. He took his hand off of her shoulder as she composed herself. Turning back to the task at hand, Josh dropped the hook over the side. They waited for a few minutes to see if there was any interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Josh quietly indicated to one particular body floating face down near the raft. It was a small woman, with long dark hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think&hellip; her sister?&rdquo; Jenna asked.</p>
<p>Before they could answer that, a huge dark shape more than ten feet long went right underneath the raft and bumped the corpse, a dorsal fin then turned away to circle again. They saw other shapes out in the water. They had been found, but not by rescuers. The deep sea&rsquo;s cleanup crew had arrived. Sharks of multiple species: bulls, hammerheads, tigers, and oceanic white tips had come to feed on the 100 plus bodies the crash had scattered across this patch of ocean. Their eyes going wide, they looked at each other. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna need a bigger boat,&rdquo; said Josh worriedly. Jenna just nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch something?&rdquo; Sarah&rsquo;s voice came from the side of the raft across from the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, not yet, though we definitely see something,&rdquo; came the reply from Jenna.</p>
<p>Seeing that the shark was still circling, Josh decided to try to look at the body and see if it was Manami&rsquo;s sister. He took a handful of hair, raised the face above the water line, and looked at a distorted, cut up, swollen face of a Japanese woman who bore a striking resemblance to his raft mate. He further confirmed it by raising her head up higher and seeing a small pendant that matched Manami&rsquo;s. She had a horrible wound in her chest; she&rsquo;d never really had a chance. His heart sank, he was going to have to tell her, it wouldn&rsquo;t be right not to. He turned speak to Jenna and was instead met by all four fellow raft mates looking on in horror. He&rsquo;d been so tense and focused that he hadn&rsquo;t noticed Sarah, Manami, and Pham Na taking an interest in what he was doing. He gently set Miki&rsquo;s head back into the water so that her sister wouldn&rsquo;t have to look upon the decomposing visage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Manami sobbed and lunged for her sister. Josh and Jenna let her go past. She pulled her sister&rsquo;s head out of the water again and in a grisly embrace, held her sister&rsquo;s head to her chest as the rest of Miki&rsquo;s body hung in the water, and cried pitifully. That lasted a whole minute, until the bull shark circled back around, and seeing the activity around what it thought was its meal, bit into Miki&rsquo;s leg and pulled. Other sharks that had come to the area saw this activity and decided to get in on the meal. Manami nearly lunged out of the raft, determined to keep the shark from taking her sister&rsquo;s body. Josh, grabbed her by the shoulders and pulled her back in, and Jenna tried to console her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manami, I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; Jenna said sorrowfully, crying sympathetically as she held the smaller woman. Sarah was crying and helped to console Manami as well. Pham Na and Josh really didn&rsquo;t know what to do, Pham Na wasn&rsquo;t stupid, and could see that the young woman was in pain, so he retreated to the back of the raft. Josh just sat, watching the sharks carry out their work scavenging Miki&rsquo;s corpse. The raft was silent on the calm sea, the only sounds were of the sharks grabbing flesh and rolling to tear off chunks. The slapping sound of their fins on the water and the horrible ripping sounds were all that could be heard once Manami&rsquo;s crying softened as the sharks dismembered the corpse. The sea turned red around the raft, and the smell of blood wafted up and assaulted the noses of the survivors. Sarah hazarded a look, and all that she could make out was the horrible twisting motions of the sharks, and an unrecognizable mass that was once a vibrant, happy-go-lucky young woman.</p>
<p>The days had passed since the dismemberment of Miki&rsquo;s body. The survivors, despite their rationing, were going through their water quickly, and the water filter was becoming less and less effective, leaving more and more salt in the water. Soon it wouldn&rsquo;t be safe to drink, and that would be the end. Over the past few days, everyone had started getting squirrelly, Manami seemed almost catatonic, Jenna was despondent, Sarah, despite trying to play the cool and collected manager, was just barely holding together, and Pham Na had taken to glancing suspiciously at Josh, as if sizing him up for something. Josh was getting ready for a fight. As far as he was concerned it was just a matter of time. He didn&rsquo;t trust Pham Na, and hadn&rsquo;t since the first episode when he tried to deny Manami water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we sure there isn&rsquo;t land around?&rdquo; Sarah said, breaking a long silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Josh tersely. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Sarah said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to DO something; we can&rsquo;t just lie around and die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It looked like Sarah was starting to snap. That didn&rsquo;t help anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just, just, I don&rsquo;t want to die!&rdquo; Jenna couldn&rsquo;t hold it in anymore. &ldquo;Why the hell haven&rsquo;t they found us? Why are they leaving us here?&rdquo; She cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it! Shut the hell up!&rdquo; Sarah yelled back. &ldquo;Being hysterical won&rsquo;t make them find us, and you&rsquo;ll upset Manami.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she alright? She&rsquo;s not awake yet,&rdquo; Josh said. The women turned towards Manami, and sure enough, the small Japanese woman was unconscious, breathing shallowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give her some water,&rdquo; said Sarah, grabbing the filter bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hãy cho tôi ?ó! Cô ?y s? ch?t và chúng ta c?n n??c!&rdquo; Pham Na said, as he grabbed the water filter. Sarah pulled it back towards her, but he punched her in the left temple. She fell back, knocked out. Josh swung into action and tried to grab him, but Pham Na was quicker and jumped off the raft, with the filter in his hands. Pham Na started swimming away, though there was nowhere to go. Josh prepared to jump in after him, but Jenna grabbed him by the neck of his shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josh wait!&rdquo; she said. Sure enough, a dorsal fin was stalking Pham Na in the water. He seemed unaware of the danger, until the shark tore his leg off. He screamed in pain, blood pouring from the wound. Josh and Jenna tried paddling the raft with their hands to get over to Pham Na, but before they could, the shark returned and bit again, taking a huge piece of his right rib cage, silencing his cries with a hideous gargling sound. Josh and Jenna kept paddling, hoping to recover the water filter, but they only found pieces of plastic. What meager drinkable water they&rsquo;d had was gone. Jenna sat back down and started crying. Josh moved over to Sarah and tried to wake her. Her temple was bruised, and she was out cold. He was afraid to move her, thinking that he could make whatever her injury was worse. So now there were two unconscious women, no water, no land in sight, and Jenna was having a breakdown, not that he was exactly calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; he yelled, punching the edge of the raft. He sat back down, holding his head in his hands. He didn&rsquo;t have any ideas, without help, they were done. It was just that simple.</p>
<p>Manami and Sarah never did regain consciousness, but that was merciful. Josh and Jenna had to endure the full effects of extreme dehydration. Over the next couple of days, their lips cracked, their mouths were horribly dry. Josh thought about drinking his own urine in desperation, but neither of them could produce any. Their rationing had slowed down their production, and now it had stopped. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I pee?&rdquo; Jenna finally asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think our kidneys have shut down,&rdquo; Josh replied. They both watched the sun set at the door of the raft, each having the feeling that they wouldn&rsquo;t see the dawn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Jenna, I couldn&rsquo;t save anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be sorry for anything,&rdquo; she reassured him. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t anyone&rsquo;s fault. You did what you could, we all did,&rdquo; she put her hand on his shoulder and forced a small smile onto her face. The last two conscious survivors shared a last moment, reassuring each other that even lost in the middle of the vast ocean, they would not die alone. Josh thought about everything that he hadn&rsquo;t done, and after he thought of his family, he drifted to the old fantasy, ever since he saw that movie as a child, the image of a mermaid, a creature that only existed in fantasy. In his desperate, nearly delirious state, he thought that a mermaid would be able to save them. But there was no such thing; there were no mermaids, no hope, and no escape save death. That was his last thought as he slipped away, to whatever afterlife greeted him.</p>
<p>Not so far away from the little raft, four shapes in diamond formation cruised at 20 knots though the deep, blue ocean. They undulated through the water in long, vertical strokes, their wide flukes powering them easily through the water. If an observer were to approach, the four shapes would resolve into three feminine and one masculine humanoid shapes above the waist. The &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; shapes of merfolk.</p>
<p>Trevor, Rose, Kate, and Ann were on the return leg to Mermaid Island when they detected the crash and the debris in the distance. They decided to check it out and see what could be done. The pod found a single survival raft that appeared to have people in it, and they paused underneath to discuss a game plan for their contact with the occupants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up first and check it out,&rdquo; Trevor said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if they&rsquo;re dead, if they&rsquo;re alive, then we can figure out how to help them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if they&rsquo;re not unconscious?&rdquo; asked Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll be going up slowly to check. Maybe we can tow the raft without them seeing us or something,&rdquo; replied Trevor. Trevor started to move up to the surface at the front of the raft, slowly inching his head over the edge of the door. He saw a big man and a pretty blonde girl lying down, eyes closed. They were close enough that he could reach them, so he checked their pulses and found them slow, but steady. He could see an older woman and a younger Asian girl with obvious head injuries whose breathing was pretty shallow. They were too far away to reach easily. He ducked back down to his mates. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all out cold, and look pretty dehydrated. We need to help them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose immediately spoke up. &ldquo;The atoll we found yesterday with a spring isn&rsquo;t too far from here, we can tow the raft there and get them some fresh water and food, and try to revive them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might not work,&rdquo; Trevor warned, &ldquo;They are pretty far gone, and we might have to-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can deal with that when we get there,&rdquo; Rose interrupted, &ldquo;But we will do whatever it takes to save them, right?&rdquo; She said forcefully, giving Trevor and her sister-wives a look that conveyed the message that this wasn&rsquo;t up for debate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sis,&rdquo; Kate replied quietly, as her identical blonde twin Ann floated next to her, &ldquo;whatever it takes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon pulling the raft to the atoll, the mers gently moved the four humans out of their raft and pulled the raft up the beach near the scrub on the largest island at the western edge of the atoll. The mers stopped to triage their charges. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re too far gone, and too beat up. I think you girls need to do your thing,&rdquo; Trevor decided. Rose nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These two are the worst off,&rdquo; said Rose, gesturing to Manami and Sarah. &ldquo;You two should take one each, and I&rsquo;ll feed the other two,&rdquo; The darkhaired mermaid moved to the first of her charges, a tall, pretty blonde girl. Rose gently laid Jenna across her lap, brushed back both her own and Jenna&rsquo;s hair, and brought her mouth to her left breast. Her milk started flowing, and Jenna instinctively swallowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a good idea to feed them Rose?&rdquo; Kate asked, once the older woman started feeding from her chest. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Rose stopped her. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t just leave them to die,&rdquo; she said as she shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this one&rsquo;s pretty, and I love her necklace!&rdquo; Ann said as she fed Manami, admiring her jewelry and the Japanese woman&rsquo;s delicate features, full lips, large eyes, and petite build.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wheel of Karma, nice!&rdquo; said Kate. &ldquo;Oh man, this feels really good&hellip;&rdquo; she trailed off, as the hormones released by feeding overtook the three mermaids.</p>
<p>Rose smiled at her sisters as she finished with Jenna, and Trevor moved her to a comfortable place in the sand. He turned and saw Rose struggling with the only man they&rsquo;d found. &ldquo;Give me a hand would you? He&rsquo;s a big dude,&rdquo; she grunted, trying to get Josh into position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry,&rdquo; Trevor said, he&rsquo;d been admiring Jenna&rsquo;s wholesome beauty for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you two like to be alone?&rdquo; Rose said, cocking an eyebrow as Trevor maneuvered Josh into position. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have four mermaids, she&rsquo;ll be with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could handle any more mermaids,&rdquo; he replied jokingly. &ldquo;Three is just fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just checking, dear,&rdquo; Rose replied, as she focused on feeding Josh.</p>
<p>Josh didn&rsquo;t know what was going on. He hadn&rsquo;t really regained consciousness until just then. Flashes and what seemed like dreams of moving at incredible speed on the water had come and gone, but he&rsquo;d quickly slipped away again. Josh felt himself being dragged over the beach, and a soft voice said, &ldquo;Give me a hand would you? He&rsquo;s a big dude,&rdquo; Then oblivion again. Now though, he felt a warm, sweet fluid trickling into his mouth, and he came closer to full wakefulness. There was something else in his mouth, something rubbery. He opened his eyes. I did something right, he thought, because I must be in heaven.</p>
<p>There was this gorgeous woman breastfeeding him. Her dark hair and violet eyes were breathtaking, and she looked like Elizabeth Taylor from one of the old movies his mother liked. She smiled at him and her jewellike eyes flashed brilliantly. Josh was immediately smitten, this woman was a vision men would walk over hot coals to be with, and finally, as she stroked his hair, she spoke: &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Rose, my pod and I found you floating in the ocean and brought you all to land. Just relax; you&rsquo;ll be fine, but you&rsquo;re going to go to sleep while our milk finishes healing you, and then we&rsquo;ll explain everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pod? He thought, What do you mean pod? I&rsquo;m alive? How? Wait&hellip; but before he could say anything, he started feeling tired, as if his limbs were made of lead and his eyelids were being pulled down like window shades, but as he drifted off, a powerful sensation began running through his body. What the hell is going on? was his last thought as he slipped into darkness again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do when they wake up?&rdquo; Trevor asked as Rose and her sisters finished feeding the four survivors. &ldquo;I mean, we just started them on the way to joining us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be fine, physically, better than fine, and everyone who has found out about mers has come to terms with it and has been able to deal with the change, including us. Once we explain everything, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be okay,&rdquo; Rose replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, what if they don&rsquo;t want to be mers?&rdquo; asked Ann. &ldquo;We wanted this, but we also isolated ourselves from the world. They may not want to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;ll be happy to be alive,&rdquo; offered Kate. &ldquo;Even with our tiaras, Ann and I needed two feedings and being in the Moonpool to trigger our change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the data Pat was getting from the Chesapeake suggests that they might not have a choice,&rdquo; Rose said. &ldquo;Even swimming through the Moon Pool was enough to start Mac and Joy on their journey towards joining us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll talk to them when they wake up, I&rsquo;ll go get some food,&rdquo; said Trevor said as he plunged into the water, his three wives looking worriedly after him, then back at their four sleeping charges, each hoping that they wouldn&rsquo;t completely lose their cool upon awaking and seeing their rescuers.</p>
<p>Several things occurred to Sarah as she came around. The first was that she was on dry land, instead of the floating raft. Secondly, her head wasn&rsquo;t throbbing from the injury she&rsquo;d sustained in the crash anymore. Thirdly, there wasn&rsquo;t a Vietnamese man punching her in the face over a water filter. She considered all of these things as positive developments, so as soon as she gathered her faculties, she sat up, brushing her short brown hair from her eyes, looked around and saw the three other survivors from the plane lying on either side of her. She saw some smoke from a campfire over a dune and headed in that direction, hoping the people who had rescued them were friendly. As she crested the dune she saw four shapes around the fire looking vaguely human. Shielding her eyes she stood up and walked forward towards the four figures, and saw that their silhouettes didn&rsquo;t look quite right below the waist, &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; she said, as she approached, hoping these people were friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh hi!&rdquo; said a blonde girl brightly as she approached. Then the sun went down far enough that that her four rescuers were no longer back lit, and she saw their true forms: Long, sinuous tails of red and black or green and gold extended for several feet below and behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like some dinner?&rdquo; offered the lone merman in a nonchalant voice, as he extended a fish roasted on a stick towards Sarah.</p>
<p>Sarah stood stock still; she couldn&rsquo;t believe what she was seeing! Real mermaids and a merman! There was no way these people were wearing costumes, their tails were bent at angles that were impossible for anyone with leg bones, and a dark haired mermaid was ambling up to her with her torso bent at a 90 degree angle up from her tail, as she supported her weight on 2 pelvic fins, 2 at her mid-tail, and her flukes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Rose, and these are my pod mates Trevor, Kate, and Ann. Please sit down, have some fish, and we can talk when the others wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 47-year old executive still wasn&rsquo;t moving, her chest was tightening up, she was short of breath, and she suddenly felt weak in the knees. She eventually sat down, bowled over by the sight of the wonders in front of her. &ldquo;Wha&ndash;, who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re mers,&rdquo; offered the merman. &ldquo;One pod of them anyway. When we found you, we towed your raft to this atoll because we knew it had water and plenty of food. So why don&rsquo;t you have some food, and we can talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, yeah, sure,&rdquo; Sarah agreed, still not quite believing what she was seeing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What exactly happened? I mean, we found you on a raft, but we didn&rsquo;t see if it was a plane or a boat sinking,&rdquo; Rose inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a plane, we were flying between Hong Kong and Fiji, and I guess a really bad storm or, something hit us, and I don&rsquo;t know why we didn&rsquo;t just fly around it, but the next thing I know I&rsquo;m floating on a raft in the ocean. I&rsquo;m really the wrong person to ask about this, I was out cold for&hellip; wait a minute, how do you know about planes, or, speak English-&rdquo; Sarah was interrupted by Kate&rsquo;s laughter, and Rose was chuckling too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We used to be normal humans like you,&rdquo; Rose said through her laughter. She stifled her giggling and continued, &ldquo;We used to be normal humans like you, I&rsquo;m sorry I didn&rsquo;t catch your name&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sarah, Sarah Mendelson,&rdquo; The older woman quickly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Sarah, nice to meet you! Anyway, we were changed on an island aways from here; there are actually quite a few of us. It all started with John and Pat&hellip; oh, hello there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She interrupted herself, as she could see the blonde girl, she didn&rsquo;t know her name yet, and the man she was with cresting the dune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Josh responded to the voice that had greeted him. Being on the opposite side of the fire, he couldn&rsquo;t see much of the four people talking to Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good to see you awake Sarah. You okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, I&rsquo;m feeling better, actually, why don&rsquo;t you come meet the people who saved us? You too Jenna,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your head Sarah? You got hit pretty hard by-&rdquo; Jenna stopped short when she saw their rescuers, as had Josh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re real, and yeah, we&rsquo;re mers,&rdquo; Trevor confirmed, curling his tail up sideways and twisting his flukes, demonstrating that he didn&rsquo;t have knees or regular ankles. Besides, his tail was far too long for those flukes to line up with normal ankles. An uncomfortable silence hung in the air for a short moment as Josh and Jenna processed the reality of their situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!&rdquo; Jenna exploded in glee and hurried over to where Kate and Ann lay. She slid onto her knees next to them, and then stopped herself as she reached for Ann&rsquo;s tail. &ldquo;Can I touch it? Please!&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, uh&hellip;&rdquo; Ann replied, a little taken aback, like everyone else, at Jenna&rsquo;s outburst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m Jenna. This is amazing, so beautiful!&rdquo; Jenna babbled as she ran her hand along the unnaturally smooth surface of Ann&rsquo;s tail, watching the firelight play along her Irish green scales and golden fringes. Jenna started peppering the twins with questions about mer life, while Rose turned to Josh. He was still standing, staring at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Rose. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; she asked. He just stood there, dumbstruck by the fact that he was staring at creatures that he&rsquo;d fantasized about since that night when he&rsquo;d seen a movie on late night TV. It had featured a mermaid who had legs when dry, and a tail when wet. He&rsquo;d seen that mermaid fill a bathtub and transform. As he&rsquo;d watched her beautiful tail unfurl, he was drawn to her in a way he still didn&rsquo;t understand. This mermaid looked dry, but still had her tail, and he realized that this was the woman who had fed him, who had brought him back to life. Afraid that if he moved, this dream would end, and the mermaid would disappear, he stood still, barely breathing. Rose shared a look with Sarah, unsure as to what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josh!&rdquo; Sarah said sharply, standing up and snapping her fingers in his face, getting between him and Rose. &ldquo;Snap out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noth-nothing,&rdquo; he sputtered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. My name is Josh Abramson. You&rsquo;re, Rose, I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and this is my mate, Trevor,&rdquo; she motioned to the merman behind her, who exchanged nods with Josh. &ldquo;Come on and sit down, and we&rsquo;ll talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re all mates with Trevor! So do you get jealous?&rdquo; Jenna asked Ann on the other side of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not really, we aren&rsquo;t just bonded with Trevor, but with each other too, so we never really have a problem of having to wait in line or anything,&rdquo; Ann replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo; Jenna blushed at the implications.</p>
<p>Josh sat down next to Rose. She sat with her tail straight out so that he could look at it. He stared at her red tail with black fringes; it was the most beautiful thing he&rsquo;d yet seen. He moved his gaze up her curvy body to her face, the firelight playing off of her shiny black hair, his heart pounding, he wanted to touch her, but he refrained because of what the merman she&rsquo;d introduced as her mate might think. Rose was simply trying to figure out this man. She could tell that his heart was pounding with her mer senses. The initial shock had worn off the other two quickly, but Josh was in this strange, almost trance-like state externally, with a heart rate that was through the roof. Taking a chance, she moved her hips and wrapped her tail around his waist, setting her flukes right in his lap. He started, but settled down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, touch it, its alright,&rdquo; she said gently, with a slight smile. Josh slowly reached out and ran his fingertips along the ribs that supported Rose&rsquo;s flukes, up to the root of her flukes where her ankles had been. He did not flinch, his heart rate slowed, and his breathing became more regular. Being able to touch her meant that she was real. She wasn&rsquo;t going to disappear into the fog of his subconscious like all of the other mermaids he&rsquo;d dreamt and thought of over the years. She felt him relax, and saw a smile creep across his face. So, we&rsquo;ve got a real sirenophile, interesting. Rose thought to herself.</p>
<p>For Josh, the experience of being this close to Rose was amazing. Touching her tail, listening to her beautiful voice, and her smell; well, she smelled delightfully&hellip; oceanic. A salty aroma tinged with something strangely like musk. It was just wonderful, and somehow fit with how a mermaid should smell. He felt himself getting aroused, and so did Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he whispered, incredibly embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; she whispered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go check on Manami, you two can keep getting to know our friends,&rdquo; Sarah said awkwardly as she got up, heading towards the only remaining survivor still asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. So, do you breathe underwater?&rdquo; Jenna asked, quickly dismissing Sarah&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, let me show you,&rdquo; said Ann. she turned away from her questioner and pulled her hair forward, showing Jenna the gills that went all the way down her back. &ldquo;They connect directly to our lungs, so when we&rsquo;re underwater, they exchange carbon dioxide from our lungs and oxygen from the sea water. One of the reasons our hair is so long is because our gills are sensitive to sunburn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awesome!&rdquo; Jenna gushed. She ran her hand down one of Ann&rsquo;s gills, she stopped at the dorsal ridge about midway down her back. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that ridge is one of the places our mer senses collect information,&rdquo; Rose said, still entangled with Josh. &ldquo;We can sense temperature, electrical activity, all sorts of things through special sensors and organs that grew within us as we changed into mers. We even think that our bonding is some sort of attenuation to each other&rsquo;s signals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? So you don&rsquo;t feel love so much as an enforced attachment?&rdquo; Josh asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the other way around. All of that bonding comes across as a deep, abiding, unconditional love that we can feel being transferred back to us from our pod mates. You have to really experience it to understand, but it&rsquo;s the greatest feeling you&rsquo;ll ever have,&rdquo; Rose replied.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sarah approached the prone body of the petite Japanese woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manami,&rdquo; Sarah said as she gently shook the younger woman&rsquo;s shoulder. Manami&rsquo;s physical wounds appeared to have healed. Sarah was amazed at the healing that had taken place among the four of them, and was determined to ask how the mers had accomplished it, but she also knew the emotional scars Manami harbored would take much longer to heal. Manmi slowly began to stir, mumbling as she started to come around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miki?&rdquo; she said sleepily as her eyes fluttered open. She saw a silhouette of a woman standing over her, and maybe, just maybe, the sight of her sister&rsquo;s body being torn apart by sharks had been a horrible nightmare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No dear,&rdquo; replied the woman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. I&rsquo;m Sarah, remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Manami started to hyperventilate. It hadn&rsquo;t been a dream, it was all real! Her sister was dead; she&rsquo;d watched as her body had been torn to shreds. She felt the sand under her and realized that they weren&rsquo;t on the raft anymore. She sat up and swiveled her head around quickly. &ldquo;Where are we? What happened?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on an island; we&rsquo;ve been rescued. They&rsquo;re&hellip; different, but they did get us here and healed us somehow,&rdquo; Sarah placed her hands on Manami&rsquo;s shoulders, forcing her to make eye contact. &ldquo;Now I need you promise me something: I need you to promise that you&rsquo;ll stay calm when you see the people who saved us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Manami asked confusedly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing&rsquo;s wrong, but they, well, you need to see this for yourself,&rdquo; Sarah reassured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami stood up and followed Sarah over the small dune towards the firelight. She didn&rsquo;t really have any other options. &ldquo;Wow, so you can paralyze people with that?&rdquo; she heard Jenna exclaim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s pretty handy. I&rsquo;ve never had to use it on a person though, just for fishing,&rdquo; Trevor replied as he showed off the stinger that each mer had at the base of their flukes. He retracted it as Manami came into view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; Ann said, smiling and moving away from Kate and Jenna towards the young woman she&rsquo;d fed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami&rsquo;s eyes went wide as saucers as she realized what she was looking at. &ldquo;Ningyo,&rdquo; the Japanese word for mermaid was all she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, exactly, ningyo,&rdquo; Rose said, still wrapped up with Josh, but all attention was on Manami, humans and mers waiting for some other reaction.</p>
<p>Manami found herself fixating on their tails, specifically their fins and scales. As she looked at them, she relived that horrible scene of a few days before, of watching other creatures that also had fins and scales and what they did to her sister&rsquo;s body, how merciless they&rsquo;d been. The mers sensed her heart rate jump, and could see her shrinking back. She gave a horrible, mournful cry and ran back to the raft up the beach, the only place she&rsquo;d been safe from the sharks on the ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Jenna said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go talk to her Sarah. We&rsquo;ll be right back everyone,&rdquo; she and Sarah moved off towards the raft, leaving Josh with the mers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be much help. Sarah and Jenna were the only ones she really talked to on the raft,&rdquo; said Josh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What exactly happened? She practically had a panic attack. I know we&rsquo;re a big shock when you first see us, but people usually don&rsquo;t run screaming,&rdquo; Rose asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many people have seen you?&rdquo; Josh asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good point,&rdquo; Rose said, with a grin. &ldquo;Nevertheless, something did happen to Manami, I can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Her sister, didn&rsquo;t survive the crash we were in,&rdquo; The three mermaids gasped. &ldquo;Secondly, we actually found her sister&rsquo;s body floating near our raft as we tried to fish. Her sister,&rdquo; Josh started choking up, &ldquo;her sister wore the same necklace she does. The sharks found us soon after we found the body, and we all watched them, watched them tear her body apart. I couldn&rsquo;t stop them, we had to hold her back from-&rdquo; Josh stopped a moment to collect himself. &ldquo;We had to keep her from jumping off the raft after the body,&rdquo; he paused; the three mermaids were wiping tears from their eyes. &ldquo;I should also tell you, there was a fifth person on the raft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened? I didn&rsquo;t see anyone else when I checked on you, and we didn&rsquo;t detect anyone else alive in the water,&rdquo; Trevor demanded.</p>
<p>Josh sighed, gathering himself. &ldquo;His name, I think, he didn&rsquo;t speak English, was Pham Na. We found him swimming in the water the morning after we crashed. He didn&rsquo;t want to give Manami water when she was still unconscious. I got the feeling that he didn&rsquo;t like me much. When the water filter that we had started becoming less effective, this all happened after Manami&rsquo;s sister Miki was eaten, Sarah went to give Manami some water, even though Manami was in shock. Well, Pham Na didn&rsquo;t approve and started fighting Sarah for the filter. Before I could do anything, he punched Sarah, jumped off the raft, and swam away,&rdquo; Josh sighed again. &ldquo;A huge shark tore him apart; Jenna and I tried to paddle the raft over to him. We tried&hellip; I tried to save him. I couldn&rsquo;t save anyone. I was completely useless. We&rsquo;d have all died if you hadn&rsquo;t shown up,&rdquo; Josh choked out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sarah and Jenna found Manami at the back of the raft, knees pulled up to her chest, sobbing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manami? Can you tell us what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Jenna said sympathetically as she sat down next to Manami and put her hand on her knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenna. I don&rsquo;t know, I just, I saw them, and, I know what they are, but, I, I just&hellip;&rdquo; the petite woman shuddered and started sobbing uncontrollably again.</p>
<p>Sarah and Jenna moved out of the raft to talk quietly among themselves. &ldquo;What are we going to do Sarah?&rdquo; Jenna asked the older woman, searching for answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She might have been in shock, but, it didn&rsquo;t look like she was in shock at the mers. She saw them, then had some reaction, then completely lost it. The only time I&rsquo;ve seen anything like that was&hellip;&rdquo; she drifted off, lost in her own thought as she worked it through in her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Sarah?&rdquo; Jenna insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a friend, in China when I was working there. He, he committed suicide, and his body was found by his son. I helped out the family, and for years afterward, every time his son heard music, it sounded, in his head, like sirens, like the sirens of the ambulances coming for his father. He was reliving the trauma from finding his father&rsquo;s body every time he heard music-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that have to do with her sister?' Jenna interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think about it, when Manami saw the mermaids, it caused her to relive seeing Miki dying, or more likely, being eaten by the sharks,&rdquo; Sarah snapped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m not a psychiatrist, but this sure looks like what happened with my friend&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what do we do?&rdquo; asked the younger woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-&rdquo; Sarah stopped short, as she saw Manami slowly coming out of the tent after hearing their conversation, they apparently hadn&rsquo;t been quiet enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, they, they really are mermaids?&rdquo; the petite woman asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are,&rdquo; Jenna responded, her excitement apparent in her voice. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very nice people, they saved our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami looked to Sarah for confirmation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sarah replied. &ldquo;It looks like they did. I don&rsquo;t know how though, I didn&rsquo;t wake up until I first met them, and we are all totally healed from head injuries, dehydration, and other injuries from the crash, in less than a day? I want to know how that happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want to know if I can be a mermaid too,&rdquo; Jenna declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it, you&rsquo;re signing up for the full package after meeting them for what, half an hour?&rdquo; Sarah wasn&rsquo;t completely shocked, she&rsquo;d seen how Jenna had reacted, but she was the consummate corporate manager, was trying to maintain control of the situation and get Jenna to use her head about their circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. They&rsquo;re beautiful, they&rsquo;re happy, they love each other, and they&rsquo;re mermaids!&rdquo; Jenna exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They also said that they&rsquo;re mated to each other and a merman, and it looks like the only option for a merman is a guy you barely know,&rdquo; Sarah retorted, trying to talk some sense into Jenna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can figure that out later,&rdquo; she turned to Manami: &ldquo;If we stay with you, do you think you can handle being around them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe if I don&rsquo;t look at them?&rdquo; Manami said shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right with you; you don&rsquo;t have to be afraid,&rdquo; Jenna reassured Manami as she put her arm around her. Manami smiled as Sarah put her arm around her other shoulder. Together, the three women walked back towards the fire, where the mers and Josh were waiting for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is everything okay?&rdquo; Josh asked. The mers were keeping silent out of deference for Manami&rsquo;s situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re working on it Josh, I&rsquo;ll explain more some other time, but for now, I&rsquo;d like to ask our friends some questions, if that&rsquo;s alright?&rdquo; Sarah replied as she and Manami took a seat on one side of the fire, and Jenna sat with Kate and Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, ask away,&rdquo; said Rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, how did you heal us, exactly? I don&rsquo;t have any injuries, and I don&rsquo;t think anyone else does either, and that&rsquo;s just not possible in such a short amount of time,&rdquo; Sarah enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was their milk,&rdquo; Josh replied before one of the mers could answer. &ldquo;I woke up and Rose was feeding me from her, her breast, and she told me that her milk would heal me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right: cells in our milk help with rebuilding and rearranging other cells,&rdquo; Rose admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rearranging, you told me how you changed into mers from normal humans before Josh and Jenna woke&hellip; I want to know exactly how you changed and why, right now,&rdquo; Sarah demanded, using her &ldquo;manager voice&rdquo; that she used to extract information and results from reluctant and underperforming employees.</p>
<p>Rose looked to the rest of her pod. Trevor shrugged his shoulders and said, &ldquo;We were going to have to tell them eventually; might as well do it now,&rdquo; Even Manami looked at him then, all of the survivors wanted to know what Rose was so reluctant to tell them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cells, we call them siren cells, that heal people, also start changing people. They stay in the body and can even reproduce themselves with the help of minerals and nutrients present in seawater. The long term effects of this are repairing of injuries, faster healing, a longer lifespan, bonding into a family unit of three females and a male, and of developing new organs and traits. Subsequent feedings can shorten the time it takes to effect a transformation, and we think that it takes concerted efforts from others who have been affected by the siren cells, to turn you into a-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;MERMAID!&rdquo; Jenna screamed gleefully, startling the seven other people around the fire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already started turning into a mermaid!&rdquo; She squealed like a little girl on Christmas day whose parents had just walked in with a pony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a way, you all have,&rdquo; Rose confirmed it. She could feel Josh&rsquo;s heart thundering in his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; she asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Was all he could say, looking into her eyes. She saw in those eyes the look of a man full of hope and anticipation for the future, and wanting to bring that future into being as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Sarah, however, was not as pleased: &ldquo;Did you even stop to consider that some of us might not want to become like you? Do you even know how long I had to fight to get where I am today in my business? What I had to give up? How&hellip; how can you take that from me?&rdquo; She stopped herself before she completely lost her composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did it to save you. You were all at death&rsquo;s door, terribly dehydrated, badly injured, and unconscious. We didn&rsquo;t have the option of waking you and asking your permission. I&rsquo;m sorry, but we didn&rsquo;t think we had any choice,&rdquo; Rose said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I don&rsquo;t want to be with him?&rdquo; Sarah said, pointing at Josh, and not caring if his feelings were hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the only other option is for you and someone else to form a second pod, but there must always be a merman and at least one mermaid, so one of you, whoever was most dominant, so I&rsquo;m guessing you, would become a male,&rdquo; Rose said, becoming annoyed at Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, that&rsquo;s if the four of you haven&rsquo;t already started to bond to each other, in which case you&rsquo;d have to challenge Josh for dominance and turn him into one of your mermaids,&rdquo; Rose felt Josh stiffen as he turned his head disbelievingly toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did that happen with your pod?&rdquo; Jenna asked. She was curious about being a mermaid and what that entailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of,&rdquo; Rose said apprehensively. &ldquo;I was originally Kate and Ann&rsquo;s older brother Robbie, but when it came time to form a pod, we had to decide. So Trevor and I each had a few feedings and fought for it, and Trevor pinned me, so I became a girl first, and then a mermaid when Trevor became a merman. My sisters joined us a few months later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh fully turned around; he looked straight into her eyes, then glancing at Trevor for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You gave up your manhood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave up nothing. Trevor could have been the mermaid, but it was worth the risk,&rdquo; Rose replied matter-of-factly. &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;d call it a risk, it actually worked out perfectly. My sisters and I wouldn&rsquo;t have mated if I was a guy, and they and Trevor had been attracted to each other for years, so it was all for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re cool with this?&rdquo; he asked Trevor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I mean, does she look or sound like a man to you?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I love her, and I always will. She&rsquo;s not Robbie any more, not really. It&rsquo;s hard to explain. The things that made Robbie a good friend are still there, but Rose&hellip;&rdquo; he furled his brow as he sought the words, &ldquo;Rose is what Robbie would have been if he&rsquo;d been born a girl, it&rsquo;s the only way I know how to say it, and she and her sisters mean everything to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, several of the first mermaids were men at some point, and the vast majority of the first mermaids to have babies were once men too. Even our dad changed into a woman so he could be in a pod with our mom, aunt, and uncle. You&rsquo;ll learn all about that when you meet the other mers,&rdquo; Rose concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So all mermaids can have children, including you?&rdquo; Josh asked for confirmation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can have children. I have two X chromosomes, ovaries, the whole package,&rdquo; Rose said, giving a sly look to her merman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean meet the other mers, are they coming here?&rdquo; Sarah asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we haven&rsquo;t yet decided what we&rsquo;re going to do about that, but now that you are all healed, we won&rsquo;t do anything without your permission,&rdquo; Trevor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s good, at least,&rdquo; Sarah said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could take you to our island first, and then you could transition in the Moon Pool like we did. You could stay here and transition here. It&rsquo;s been done away from the pool before, and frankly, I&rsquo;d like to not have to tow the raft all the way to the island,&rdquo; Trevor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can tow us to the island, change Jenna or whoever, and then tow me to Fiji. Whatever you want, my company can compensate you. I&rsquo;m too valuable to them to lose, and I value my career too much to just drop everything and be a mermaid,&rdquo; Sarah demanded derisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to change into anything either; I just want to go home!&rdquo; Manami pleaded. &ldquo;My sister is gone, and I just want to be home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain that we can just let you return to the world,&rdquo; Rose warned. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t exactly let anyone know about our existence yet. We will soon, but we can&rsquo;t simply take you back and let your company pay for our trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will do exactly that, or you will face a whole host of legal troubles that will make every mer you know miserable,&rdquo; Sarah snapped.</p>
<p>Trevor was tired of his pod being yelled at, and decided to shut down the conversation: &ldquo;Look, we won&rsquo;t solve any of these issues tonight. We need to get some sleep, and I imagine you do too. We can sort this out in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure, fine,&rdquo; Sarah responded. She moved off to sleep in the raft, and Manami slinked off after her.</p>
<p>Jenna stayed behind, looking over the mers again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead and go Jenna, I promise we&rsquo;ll be here tomorrow,&rdquo; Kate reassured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. I just wanted to say, thank you for saving our lives,&rdquo; Jenna said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m sorry no one said that before, I guess we just got caught up in, you know&hellip; So, thank you very much,&rdquo; Josh agreed.</p>
<p>That broke the foul mood that had fallen over the mers. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t just leave you, duh!&rdquo; Kate replied cheerfully.</p>
<p>Jenna smiled and retired to the raft. The mers started moving to lie in the star formation, with their tails facing out so that their sensory organs could let them know if there was anything coming. Josh watched them arrange themselves, kissing and whispering &ldquo;good night&rdquo; and &ldquo;love you&rdquo; to each other.</p>
<p>He decided to leave Jenna, Sarah and Manami alone, and dug out a cradle in the sand that was down far enough to get to the cooler subsurface sand and would also support his back and head. He lay down and tried to reconcile what had happened in his mind. He&rsquo;d been prepared to die, but instead he may be about to be reborn in a totally unexpected way, through beings that had only existed in myth until now. Please, please let this be real.</p>
<p>The morning light broke over the atoll, there were no birds on this small of an island group, so the sounds of the small waves on the shore of the lagoon and the distant roar of the surf against the other side of the island were the only sounds that greeted the dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been this dry,&rdquo; groaned Kate as she sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; responded Ann. The four mers all headed straight for the water, leaving the survivors still sleeping. Trevor clipped on the pod&rsquo;s utility belt and the mers slipped into their natural element and swam off looking for breakfast for all eight people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to get a nice sampling of food for them,&rdquo; Rose said before they split up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good sis,&rdquo; said Kate, but before she could start the search, Ann barreled through the water above her, slapping her backside with her fluke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tag you&rsquo;re it!&rdquo; Ann shouted as she went past. Kate smiled and started pursuing her sister through the lagoon. Beating their tails furiously, the twins giggled as they sped among the coral outcroppings and sandy stretches of the lagoon, playfully chasing each other through the three dimensional space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so much for their help,&rdquo; Rose sighed. She smiled at Trevor as he handed one of the collection bags from their utility belt to start collecting shellfish and other sea life for themselves and their new friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t take Sarah and Manami to Fiji, can we?&rdquo; Trevor asked.</p>
<p>Rose thought for a moment; &ldquo;No, even if we assume they can keep our secret. After all, look at all of the problems Mac and Joy had. Speaking of which, I hope they make it through their change. These guys will start changing, whether they like it or not, and if they are back in civilization, they won&rsquo;t have any way to contact us or get to the island. Never mind the fact that once they do start having problems and the inevitable blood tests happen, our secret will be out. I guess we could try talking to Pat long range through our tiaras,&rdquo; she tapped the headpiece that she had made for all of the mers. &ldquo;but I know what she&rsquo;ll say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just leave all four of them here and talk to Pat when we get home,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;That lets the Siren Cells work on them and allows time for their bonds to form. If Sarah and Manami make the decision to transition of their own accord, even though it&rsquo;s really the siren cells at work, Josh&rsquo;s pod will be much stronger and happier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Honey you&rsquo;re brilliant! We&rsquo;ll let that special &lsquo;mer magic&rsquo; work on Sarah and Manami, and they&rsquo;ll come around to Jenna and Josh&rsquo;s way of thinking,&rdquo; Rose gushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenna and Josh&rsquo;s way of thinking? What makes you think Josh wants to change too? He&rsquo;s barely said anything,&rdquo; he asked warily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you couldn&rsquo;t feel how excited Josh was? He was trying to hide it, but I think he REALLY likes mers,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he just REALLY likes you,&rdquo; Trevor came back, jealousy creeping into his voice. &ldquo;I could certainly feel that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re the only man for me. Didn&rsquo;t I prove that the other day when we completed our mission?&rdquo; She asked suggestively, putting her arms around her mate&rsquo;s neck and looking deeply into his eyes, pressing her hips into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you certainly did,&rdquo; he agreed, leaning in for a kiss. She pulled away at the last moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great, glad you agree, now let&rsquo;s get breakfast!&rdquo; She said brightly as she swam away to collect food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cruel woman,&rdquo; Trevor sighed, and he started to look for shellfish.</p>
<p>Josh awoke to an empty beach. Both the mers and the girls were gone. For a moment, he wondered if the whole thing wasn&rsquo;t just a mad dream, and he&rsquo;d somehow made up everyone as some kind of coping mechanism.</p>
<p>That thought died a quick death as two blonde mermaids rocketed out of the water about 50 yards out, laughing playfully as they chased each other. The mers were even more beautiful in daylight than by firelight. Their tails weren&rsquo;t just Irish green with gold highlights; they shimmered and refracted subtle colors. It was exquisitely beautiful, and their laughter as they played was a symphony of perfect pitch created without the slightest effort. Josh&rsquo;s heart jumped in his chest again. It was real, it was all real! He was going to be a merman.</p>
<p>His reverie was broken by the mermaids soaring out of the water one after the other, the colors flashing along their tails in the morning sun, and he realized that he could see them perfectly, even more clearly than he would have seen with his glasses or contacts, which were both at the bottom of the Pacific. It just confirmed what the mers had told him: The Siren Cells would continue working on their bodies. That would be the key. Jenna obviously wanted to be a mermaid, but would she want to be with him? On the surface, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be much of a choice, but with the mers' ability to change sexes, who knows what was possible. Maybe I&rsquo;m just overthinking it. Maybe I should just come out and say it. Could he make himself say it? How hard could it be? He&rsquo;d hidden this, fascination, with mermaids for years. Friends, family, no one knew. It just wasn&rsquo;t something you brought up in conversation with people.</p>
<p>The mermaids flew out of the water again as they played, and he heard a gasp next to him. Josh had been so lost in thought that he hadn&rsquo;t heard Jenna walking up next to him, and he started. &ldquo;Geez, don&rsquo;t sneak up on a guy like that!&rdquo; he said, settling down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did big, mean old me sneak up on y&rsquo;all?&rdquo; Jenna teased. She turned her attention back to the lagoon, hoping to see the mers again. When that didn&rsquo;t happen, she turned her attention back towards Josh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are beautiful, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; she asked, trying to gauge his interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; was his only reply. He said it with a great deal of tension in his voice, like she was probing a wound. What is it with him? She wondered. He&rsquo;s all over the map, like he&rsquo;s trying to hide something. She watched Josh&rsquo;s jaw clench, and his whole body seemed to tense up.</p>
<p>Jenna decided to just be direct: &ldquo;Look, y&rsquo;all can probably tell I want to be a mermaid; now do you want to be a merman?&rdquo; She asked, keeping her voice soft and putting her hand on his shoulder so it wouldn&rsquo;t sound like a harsh ultimatum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Josh stopped himself again. He was straining to stop himself from blurting out that he wanted to be a merman, especially with a beautiful woman like her as his mermaid. &ldquo;Look, can we talk about this later? Alone?&rdquo; He said as he nodded in the direction of the approaching Manami and Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about what?&rdquo; Sarah asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Family arrangements,&rdquo; Jenna replied. &ldquo;Or should I say pod? What do you say Josh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh wound up being saved from the uncomfortable situation by the mers emerging from the surf with breakfast. Manami practically hid behind Sarah to avoid looking at the mers in broad daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; Ann said brightly. &ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;re hungry, we got breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;we&rsquo; kemo sabe? You were off playing tag!&rdquo; Rose retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was beautiful, by the way. Watching y&rsquo;all play was wonderful, I can&rsquo;t wait to do it myself,&rdquo; Jenna said to Kate and Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, soon, but for now, gather round, we thought you&rsquo;d like a sample of what this place has to offer,&rdquo; Rose said as the feast of shellfish and sea grasses was laid out by her sisters and husband. &ldquo;I take it you&rsquo;re all okay with shellfish?&rdquo; She asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Jenna said enthusiastically. &ldquo;&lsquo;Bout the only thing I could eat in Korea was seafood. I didn&rsquo;t like the kimchee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you go, this is a sea cucumber,&rdquo; said Rose as she handed Jenna an oblong, green-grey object that only bore a slight resemblance to its terrestrial namesake. Jenna brought it up to her mouth, but just as she was about to bite down, the small animal wriggled in her grasp. She shrieked at the sudden movement and flung the creature back into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said that was a cucumber!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a SEA cucumber, you&rsquo;ve never heard of them? I thought you lived in Korea?&rdquo; Rose chuckled. Josh, Trevor, Kate, Ann, and Sarah were laughing uproariously. Even Manami had cracked a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just ate fish-seafood!&rdquo; Jenna protested. &ldquo;And shrimp and things like that. I really thought it was a vegetable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, that was just so funny,&rdquo; Josh apologized, still chuckling at Jenna&rsquo;s reaction.</p>
<p>Jenna eventually cracked a smile, though she did avoid the sea cucumbers for the time being. Manami went for the sea grasses and bi-valves, said a quiet &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; and retreated to the raft without further comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; Rose called after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check on her,&rdquo; Josh volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave her be, she&rsquo;s got enough to worry about without you drooling on her,&rdquo; Sarah said derisively as she struggled with an oyster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just trying to help,&rdquo; Josh said. &ldquo;Speaking of help, I can shuck that for you with a knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it,&rdquo; said Rose, holding out her hand. Sarah placed the oyster in her hand, and Rose easily popped it open with her finger, disconnected the muscle holding the animal in its shell, and handed it back to Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you do that?&rdquo; Jenna asked in awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working out,&rdquo; Rose replied with a wink of her eye. &ldquo;But seriously, we&rsquo;re stronger than the average human. It helps out quite a bit,&rdquo; she popped open another oyster and handed it to Josh, who popped it down, liquor and all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. He picked up another oyster. &ldquo;Mind if I borrow your knife Trevor? I&rsquo;d better learn to do this without cutting my fingers off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Trevor handed Josh the large fixed-blade. &ldquo;Just wiggle the knife edge in, yeah, like that. Now twist a little to open it, and cut that muscle there. Good job, now sweep under the oyster to disconnect it from the shell, there you are,&rdquo; he concluded as Josh finished dispatching the shellfish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you, lady,&rdquo; Josh said with a flourish as he handed the fresh oyster to Jenna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, thank you,&rdquo; she said with a smile as she took the offered food and slurped it down. Sarah rolled her eyes at the display, and began working through her own pile of sea grasses.</p>
<p>The rest of breakfast was uneventful, and after the debris was cleared away, Trevor and Josh went off to build a small lean-to for some extra shelter, while the three mermaids settled into a front-to-back line and began grooming each other&rsquo;s waist-length hair. Ann was in the front of the line, and she motioned for Jenna to sit in front of her. &ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ll brush out your hair, it needs it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Jenna replied. She hadn&rsquo;t been too conscientious about her hair during their ordeal, but now that she was safe and fed, she could relax a bit. Besides, she wanted to spend as much time as she could with the mermaids. &ldquo;Sarah, if you sit in front of me I&rsquo;ll do your hair,&rdquo; she said brightly to the older woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay Jenna,&rdquo; Sarah said &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t have long enough hair for it to do any good,&rdquo; Sarah said as she awkwardly smoothed her off the shoulder-length brown hair.</p>
<p>Josh was over with Trevor, trying to desperately remember his knot tying skills from Boy Scouts as they worked the vines and wood into a lean-to. He tried to focus on building a shelter that could stand up to whatever weather hit the island, and not staring at the mermaids whose mate was right there with him. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he finally said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I got so familiar last night with Rose, she&rsquo;s just-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it man. She&rsquo;s friendly, but I know she loves me,&rdquo; Trevor replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do it?&rdquo; asked Josh &ldquo;I mean, do you ever feel like you don&rsquo;t give enough attention to one of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trevor chuckled at that. &ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re pretty good at asserting themselves. Seriously though, it has never really been an issue with us, or any other pod, really. It actually helps that the mermaids are attracted to each other as well as their merman. Sometimes they want some mermaid only attention, sometimes it&rsquo;s one on one with you; sometimes it&rsquo;s all four of you at once. There&rsquo;s some things that a merman can do for all three of his girls. Just go with your gut and you&rsquo;ll do fine when the time comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All four, at once, you mean you&mdash;&rdquo; Josh was surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna to let you figure that out yourself, dude,&rdquo; Trevor said with a smile on his face that told Josh he would not be disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering,&rdquo; Jenna asked as she felt Ann&rsquo;s fingers go through her hair. &ldquo;I kind of got the idea last night that all y&rsquo;all have sex with each other, not just Trevor. You&rsquo;re all sisters though, so, I mean, isn&rsquo;t that a little&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really feel that way for us,&rdquo; Ann responded. &ldquo;It was a weird idea before we changed, but afterwards, I&rsquo;ve never had a problem making love to my sister wives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like that for all of the mermaids. Remember we aren&rsquo;t just bonded to our merman, but to each other, and that extends to sex too,&rdquo; Rose added. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll understand eventually Jenna. I really don&rsquo;t know any other way to explain how much I love my sisters,&rdquo; she ended her point by turning Ann&rsquo;s head and kissed her in a very un-sisterly way. Jenna blushed hard and looked at Sarah, who was very uncomfortable about the whole thing herself.</p>
<p>Jenna noticed Manami had emerged from the raft with the remains of her lunch, and was standing watching the scene before her. She&rsquo;d heard the word sister and saw Kate and Ann kiss, and that was just too much for her. There was an unmistakable look of anguish on her face. She dropped her refuse and went right back into the raft. Jenna and Sarah went after her to console her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t I feel like an ass,&rdquo; Rose said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Josh asked as he and Trevor returned from building the lean-to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were inconsiderate jerks,&rdquo; Kate said. &ldquo;We threw our sisterhood in Manami&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; Josh replied, as he struggled to think of something to say that.</p>
<p>Rose gestured for Josh to come closer. He kneeled down next to her. &ldquo;You need to be in there with them,&rdquo; she whispered. Josh looked puzzled. &ldquo;Whether you know it or not, whether they know it or not, you are bonded to them. Our milk started that process. You&rsquo;re a family, a pod, and Manami needs all of her pod mates to help her grieve for her sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh looked at Rose again; she was challenging him, seeing if he was ready to shoulder the burden of being a merman. Josh made his decision right then. He wanted it badly, but becoming a family with these women wouldn&rsquo;t be just a matter of Siren Cells and fantastic transformations, he would have to prove his mettle physically and emotionally to earn their trust. The big man took that first step as he walked up to the raft that held three women. He looked in and saw Sarah and Jenna holding Manami as she sobbed uncontrollably, tears running down the American women&rsquo;s faces. He kneeled inside the raft, enfolded them in his arms, and was simply there for one of them as they helped Manami pass through another stage of grief.</p>
<p>Rose regarded the situation thoughtfully and came to a decision. &ldquo;Trevor, let me have your knife, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trevor saw the look in his mate&rsquo;s eyes and knew that arguing with Rose would be useless. He quietly handed over the large survival knife. Rose dove into the lagoon and found a quiet place to work, within a horseshoe of lava covered with fan coral, which created a well-lit, though protected area the larger fish seemed to avoid. She&rsquo;d been able to create headpieces for each of the mers by polymerizing the metals in the seawater around her. Using the tip of the knife as her focus, she began creating tiaras for the mermaids-to-be and a headband for the future merman. When she got to the tiara for Manami, she decided to make it something special. Using considerable mental effort, she incorporated the intricate pattern she&rsquo;d seen on the small pendant Manami wore. It was in the shape of the Buddhist Wheel of Karma, and she interleaved that design into the front of Manami&rsquo;s tiara. It took considerable effort to deviate from the standard design that she gave the headpieces, and it took her over an hour, but once she had the final headpiece done, she swam back to the beach.</p>
<p>She arrived to find Jenna talking with Kate and Ann, Manami was in the water bathing now that the men were gone. &ldquo;Trevor went to show Josh where the spring is and to fill the canteen, and Sarah insisted on going with them,&rdquo; Kate reported. She saw what Rose had in her hand and her eyes went wide. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a big step. Are they ready for those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll need them to contact us, eventually,&rdquo; Rose replied. &ldquo;I also wanted to give Manami something nice. Maybe it will help her to not be so afraid of us,&rdquo; she said as she showed the specially-decorated tiara to her sister and a puzzled Jenna. &ldquo;Now Jenna, once you become mers, these will allow you to communicate with each other underwater. In addition, they act as a sort of focus for mer senses, they can enhance them even before you become mers. For instance, we used them with my sisters, and it helped cut down the time it took for them to change by hours,&rdquo; she concluded with a meaningful look at the human girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Jenna reacted with a knowing look as she took a tiara from Rose. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re beautiful. When do we start changing? I can&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo; She said hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are still a few things to figure out,&rdquo; Rose replied. She looked down the beach towards Manami, who was still bathing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about Sarah and Manami-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want to change,&rdquo; Jenna said flatly. &ldquo;Are you sure we have to wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should she wait Rose?&rdquo; Ann interjected. &ldquo;You and Trevor waited for us for months and it was fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was still a guy when you left, remember?&rdquo; Rose retorted. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had milk and been around each other; they&rsquo;ve bonded, or at least started to. Tuo bonded to Sandy with a few sips of milk and holding him in his arms, or so Pat told me.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: imagine if after you and Kate had drunk from the canteens, Trevor and I took off and left you for months. You would have bonded to us, or if we were separated from you now, how much you would miss us? Jenna and Josh need to stay with Manami and Sarah,&rdquo; Rose declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you are going to leave us,&rdquo; Jenna sighed dejectedly. &ldquo;How long until you come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;ve got a plan as to how you and Josh will be able to push forward to your own changes until we come back. It&rsquo;ll help with your bonding, and it&rsquo;ll be easier to change you once we, and maybe another pod or two, come back to finish changing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Josh even want to change? He was really weird with you last night,&rdquo; Jenna asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me, Josh will go for this. I&rsquo;d bet anything he wants to be a merman just as much as you want to be a mermaid,&rdquo; Rose answered. &ldquo;Now, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re going to do&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh and Sarah followed Trevor as he crashed through the bush, pushing the undergrowth aside as he salamandered along to remake the trail that had first been blazed when the mers had scouted the atoll. After the rescue of Harold Matthews, it had been decided that knowledge of which atolls and islands in the vicinity of Mermaid Island could support human life would be very useful information to have, so that anyone they might happen to pick up could be revived and questioned before being shown the location of the mers&rsquo; home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So how many mers are on this island?&rdquo; Sarah asked as she followed Trevor, Josh trailing behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About 40; why do you ask? You want to be towed to Fiji after all,&rdquo; Trevor responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just curious. I may not want to be a mermaid, but you&rsquo;re still not something I see every day,&rdquo; Sarah replied. &ldquo;Speaking of wanting to be a mer, you coming to with us Josh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Trevor interrupted as he crashed through the final bits of undergrowth. The spring ran out of a hill in the center of the large western island of the atoll, forming a pond that drained northeasterly towards the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay then, let&rsquo;s fill some canteens shall we?&rdquo; Josh breathed out. Relieved he didn&rsquo;t have to answer the question without first talking to the only woman on the island that wanted to be a mermaid that wasn&rsquo;t one already.</p>
<p>When they arrived back at the camp, Jenna and the mermaids were just finishing up a conversation, and Manami had dressed and returned to the raft. &ldquo;What are you four smiling about?&rdquo; Josh asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were just figuring a few things out,&rdquo; Jenna replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going back to their island, not immediately anyway. Sarah and Manami obviously don&rsquo;t want to go there, and you haven&rsquo;t said anything,&rdquo; she gave Josh a meaningful look, &ldquo;so the mers are going to talk to their leaders and figure out what to do with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, okay,&rdquo; Josh said uneasily.</p>
<p>Sarah had heard the conversation, &ldquo;You mean we&rsquo;re stuck here?&rdquo; she turned towards the mers: &ldquo;I told you my company would give you whatever you wanted. What&rsquo;s the hold up?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not up to us,&rdquo; Rose explained. &ldquo;We need to talk to Pat and John and figure out if there&rsquo;s a way to do it without you running into problems with our milk in your system. And there is the whole unanswered question if we can trust both of you to keep our secret. Even if you wanted to keep the secret, it would be hard. For example, how are you going to explain you and Manami just showing up off the coast of Fiji, having survived a plane crash and at least a week at sea, completely healed, the picture of health?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! I just want to get out of here,&rdquo; she retorted &ldquo;I have no interest in giving up my whole life to change into a mermaid, or be in his harem,&rdquo; she sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Josh, Jenna, Rose, Kate, Ann and Trevor said all at once. &ldquo;We are not a harem, we&rsquo;re a family! Trevor treats my sisters and I with nothing but love and respect. Have you been watching and listening to us at all?&rdquo; Rose retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said that&rsquo;s how I think of any of you three?&rdquo; Josh said. &ldquo;I want&hellip; I want to start a family as a merman, but if-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; Sarah cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just like all the men I had to deal with while I built a business in Asia. They were always trying to get me into bed, treating me like I was their property. Get this through your head: I don&rsquo;t want to be a mermaid. Not with you, not with anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me, lady,&rdquo; Josh said quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit I do want to be a merman, who wouldn&rsquo;t? To be younger, fitter, better looking&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to be alone all my life. I don&rsquo;t think of you and the other women as harem girls either. Besides..,&rdquo; His voice suddenly trailed off and he got an upset look on his face. Can I tell her the other part too? He thought. Hell, she&rsquo;ll just find out eventually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides what?&rdquo; Sarah asked angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought about mermaids since I was a kid, okay?&rdquo; He responded, daring her to ridicule him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought about them, fantasized, daydreamed, and now, here they are! I&rsquo;m fucking ecstatic that they exist, there is a whole damn island of them! Even better, they want us to join them! If someone had offered me this, to be good-looking, married to three beautiful mermaids, and to be a merman, I&rsquo;d have sold everything and asked when the boat left in a second. All the professional success I&rsquo;ve had means jack shit to me. All of my friends have families, and I&rsquo;m 35 and I&rsquo;m alone, okay, and now I not only won&rsquo;t be alone anymore, I&rsquo;ll be a merman, so yes, I&rsquo;m excited about it, and I want it to happen!&rdquo; He finished his rant. Sarah had actually taken a couple of steps back as he became more and more upset.</p>
<p>Rose crossed her arms and put a self-satisfied smile on her face. &ldquo;What did I tell you Jenna? You have a merman after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; she said quietly, and then smiled as she walked right up to Josh, &ldquo;I was beginning to wonder where y&rsquo;all stood on the question,&rdquo; she then stood on her toes and pecked him on the cheek. She turned and shared a smile with Kate and Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look Sarah, I&rsquo;m sorry I yelled, but you really pissed me off with that harem comment. If you knew me, you&rsquo;d know I&rsquo;m not like that,&rdquo; Josh said quietly. She said nothing; she just struck an angry look and walked back to the raft.</p>
<p>Josh turned to Jenna, who stood smiling at him. &ldquo;I know I don&rsquo;t look like much, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she can affect how you look, and you her, once you start changing. You can even pick your tail colors,&rdquo; Kate interrupted, stroking her green and gold tail for emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, you can make me look like anything you want,&rdquo; Josh told Jenna. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just lucky that I&rsquo;ll have a mermaid as beautiful as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to a person than how they look,&rdquo; Jenna replied. &ldquo;And it will be a while before we have to worry about tail color anyway,&rdquo; she said with a sigh.</p>
<p>Trevor and Rose shared a look, and finally, the merman spoke up: &ldquo;We need to go. Pat will rip us a new one as it is for being late and not contacting her. We&rsquo;ll do our best, but I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;ll say about you four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sounds like a treat,&rdquo; Jenna said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She just worries. She has a lot of good reasons. Once you meet her, see the society we&rsquo;re building, and hear the stories of some of the other mers, you&rsquo;ll understand,&rdquo; Rose assured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you&rsquo;ll need the tools,&rdquo; Trevor said as he salamandered over near the remains of the fire where he&rsquo;d left the pod&rsquo;s utility belt. He picked it up and handed it to Josh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours now. It has just about everything you should need: a knife, line, compass, signal mirror, even flint and steel. This is your pod, your atoll, you have to protect them,&rdquo; he said as he looked Josh in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, I promise,&rdquo; Josh said as he took the belt.</p>
<p>Jenna rolled her eyes. &ldquo;You want him to kneel so you can knight him?&rdquo; She asked with a crooked smile.</p>
<p>Kate, Ann, and Rose burst out laughing, and Josh&rsquo;s face turned a bright red. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m being serious,&rdquo; Trevor said. &ldquo;He has a duty to protect them. That&rsquo;s what mermen do, protect our pod;&rdquo; he looked Rose in the eye, &ldquo;and our pod&rsquo;s future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose smiled warmly at her mate. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go then, since the atoll is in such good hands. Just remember what we talked about Jenna. A pod should be around in a month or so. Whether it&rsquo;s us or another pod, we don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t worry, we won&rsquo;t forget you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenna cast a predatory smile towards Josh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t forget. It&rsquo;ll be nice getting to know him without worrying about impending death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you again, for everything,&rdquo; Josh said. Rose smiled warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome again. See you soon,&rdquo; The other mers waved and smiled, then turned and salamandered into the lagoon, they each flapped their tails and disappeared into the water, headed towards an opening in the reefs to begin their long journey home.</p>
<p>As they headed out into the open ocean and accelerated to their cruising speed, Kate thought along the mental communication channel enabled by their headpieces: [What do you think will happen?] she asked.</p>
<p>[That&rsquo;s up to them. If all goes well, we&rsquo;ll find a willing proto-pod. If not, it&rsquo;s up to Pat and John, I guess.] Rose answered.</p>
<p>[I hope they turn out okay, I liked Jenna, and I felt so bad for Manami. She lost&hellip;] Kate stopped.</p>
<p>[We know, dear sister.] Ann answered. [Let&rsquo;s just get home.] The mers cruised towards the northeast and their home island.</p>
<p>Josh and Jenna stood on the beach, looking out at the lagoon&rsquo;s pure blue waters. They stood silently, listening to the warm breeze rustle through the palms on the atoll. The departure of the mers had sucked the magic out of the place, at least for the two humans on the beach. The sun was now harsh and bright instead of warm and comforting, the sand hot and stinging, and the breeze brought no more comfort. Josh&rsquo;s shoulders sagged; he rested his head against his chest. A tear rolled down Jenna&rsquo;s cheek. She reached out and took Josh&rsquo;s hand, and he raised his head and looked her in the eye. She smiled sadly, and they looked into each others' eyes, comforting each other through touch and the knowledge that someday, they too would be one with the sea, bound to each other in perfect love. They embraced, and Josh leaned down to whisper in Jenna&rsquo;s ear: &ldquo;Has anything changed with you yet?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t feel any different. Why?&rdquo; she responded curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see perfectly, no glasses, no contacts,&rdquo; he revealed to her. She pulled back to look him in the eyes. Her smile widened, and she embraced him again, this news, along with Rose&rsquo;s plan, raised her hopes that she would be a mermaid sooner than Josh or the other women could imagine. Time would tell.</p>
<p>That night, Josh laid under the lean-to. The moon was new, leaving the atoll dark, the only sound being the roar from the surf hitting the outside of the islands. Josh couldn&rsquo;t sleep. The rest of the day had been very tense. Manami and Sarah wouldn&rsquo;t even look at him, barely acknowledging his presence at lunch or dinner. Looking up at the night sky, he realized that he&rsquo;d never seen so many stars at once. This was probably one of the few places on Earth where the sky was totally free of light pollution from population centers. The band of the Milky Way draped across the middle of the sky, he could pick out the Southern Cross, but he still didn&rsquo;t know too many of the southern hemisphere constellations. The uncountable twinkling lights were beautiful to see; it allowed his mind to start relaxing. He was so enamored by the night sky that he didn&rsquo;t hear Jenna leave the raft, or her approach as she walked quietly over the sand towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josh, you awake?&rdquo; She asked as she stepped into his field of vision.</p>
<p>He broke his reverie as her silhouette intruded into his view; &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I was just enjoying the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you&hellip; mind if I join you?&rdquo; she quietly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenna laid down next to Josh, and to his surprise, she cuddled up next to him with her head on his shoulder and an arm around his chest. She saw the surprise on his face. &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, yeah,&rdquo; he responded.</p>
<p>They settled down and stared at the universe for a bit. Jenna whispered to Josh, before they fell asleep: &ldquo;Pink. I want my tail to be pink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dark blue,&rdquo; Josh replied. They fell asleep there, entwined together.</p>
<p>Manami watched the lagoon, looking for any sign of Josh and Jenna. In their week and a half on the island, Josh and Jenna had struggled to find enough food to feed the four of them. It was as difficult for the humans to catch fish and stay down long enough to collect other food as easily as the mers had found breakfast that first morning. She saw a splash about 50 yards out into the lagoon, and heard yelling. &ldquo;Fuckjust go!&rdquo; came a male voice, as Josh stabbed away with a homemade spear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swim!&rdquo; a blonde woman yelled in a southern drawl. The two humans fought their way ashore as fins splashed all around them. Manami gasped and averted her eyes, not looking too closely at the reef sharks that were tearing at the large grouper Josh and Jenna had managed to kill. Unfortunately, killing the grouper has released quite a bit of blood, which had attracted the small local reef sharks. They had bitten chunk after chunk off of the fish as Josh had tried to fight them off, drag the fish, and tell Jenna to get away so she wouldn&rsquo;t get hurt. Jenna came up on shore, scraped up, wearing nothing but shorts and her bra, and sat panting as Josh trudged out of the water to the front of the raft with what remained of the fish. More than half of it had been shredded by the sharks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you to go!&rdquo; Josh yelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to just leave you!&rdquo; Jenna yelled back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a mess, look at you,&rdquo; she got up and started addressing Josh&rsquo;s wounds, many of which had broken the skin and were causing him to bleed. She plucked a small tooth out of his arm. &ldquo;Manami, hand me my shirt, it&rsquo;s in the raft,&rdquo; she said as she went to tear pieces of his shirt off for bandages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave my shirt, okay?&rdquo; He asked, backing away from Jenna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly; besides, you&rsquo;ve been losing weight,&rdquo; she retorted, and went to grab his shirt again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been losing weight because I can&rsquo;t fish for crap,&rdquo; he said dejectedly as he held her at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re losing weight because you leave too much of the food for us,&rdquo; Jenna retorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not noble of you, it&rsquo;s stupid. I need you to fish with me; I can&rsquo;t catch enough on my own to keep us going. So eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least we got something out of this one,&rdquo; Manami said as she came back. &ldquo;The collar and cheeks should be big enough to feed two of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave those to you and Josh,&rdquo; Jenna said. &ldquo;Sarah go for water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Manami replied. &ldquo;You know she doesn&rsquo;t want to be around you two anymore than necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, she thinks we&rsquo;ll jump her and change her into a mermaid on the spot,&rdquo; Jenna joked. Manami then finished retrieving Jenna&rsquo;s shirt, a thermal blanket, and the survival knife. Jenna and Josh tore up the shirt and bandaged each others' wounds. Josh then took the knife and began cleaning the remains of the fish and putting the meat on the thermal blanket to keep it off of the sand.</p>
<p>Sarah returned with the canteen and a couple of coconuts to add to the meal. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you guys get?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;And what the hell happened to you two?&rdquo; she demanded when she saw the rags tied around Josh and Jenna&rsquo;s arms and legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look upon what&rsquo;s left of a grouper. It was much bigger before the sharks took their share,&rdquo; Josh said ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice job though, good looking pieces of fish,&rdquo; she smiled and helped break down the coconuts. The four of them ate the fish and coconut quietly. Jenna watching Josh intently to make sure he got half the collar and one of the cheek muscles of the big fish. After the meal, The four of them sat around the blanket, the remains of the coconut shells and a few pin bones from the grouper the only remnants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here we are,&rdquo; Jenna to said to Josh with a predatory look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are here indeed,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>She laughed and moved over to sit sideways on his lap, her arms around his neck and her legs off to the left. he put his arms around her waist and looked longingly into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hair&rsquo;s coming back and getting longer too,&rdquo; she said as she ran her long, graceful fingers through his new growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you feel, um&hellip;&rdquo; he glanced downward at her chest as her left breast pressed into him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you like?&rdquo; she turned and pushed her chest into him, keeping eye contact and smiling at him. &ldquo;My bra is getting a little tight. Think I should take it off?&rdquo; Josh blushed hard. She laughed softly at his embarrassment and her ability to wrap him around her little finger. Manami just stared wide-eyed at Jenna&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a room you two,&rdquo; Sarah rolled her eyes, but didn&rsquo;t move away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? The mers do this in front of each other all the time. Care to join in?&rdquo; She cocked an eyebrow at Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m going back to civilization as soon as they get back. Don&rsquo;t try to get me into your orgy,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What orgy?&rdquo; Jenna said. &ldquo;I want to wait till we&rsquo;re mers to have sex. It&rsquo;ll be so special that way&hellip;&rdquo; she trailed off, looking into Josh&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting more aggressive, sleeping with me, trying to take my shirt off, tearing your shirt to pieces, this&hellip;what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to sleep in the lean-to as a way of getting to know you. As for this; I&rsquo;ve decided that I&rsquo;m not happy with how fast we&rsquo;re progressing. It&rsquo;s so frustrating. We spend a ton of time in the water, feeding the siren cells in our bodies, we sleep in the same place to bond to each other, and I don&rsquo;t know about y&rsquo;all, but I try to think about the things I want to change, getting slimmer, wider hips, bigger boobs, gills, but not much has happened. Maybe if we act like mers, with a mermaid in charge, no clothing, maybe we can make it go faster?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t get it; I&rsquo;m supposed to be the dominant male, but you&rsquo;re in charge. How does that work?&rdquo; Josh asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the male thing is more physical, more on a one to one basis, while I make more wide-ranging decisions. Besides, in some cultures, it&rsquo;s the job of the husband to provide sex to the wife when she wants. It doesn&rsquo;t make you any less of a man to give me what I want,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you wonder why I don&rsquo;t want to be in a harem. Dominant male, give me a break,&rdquo; Sarah snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t listen to the other half of that. The mermaids are in charge. You don&rsquo;t want to be in charge?&rdquo; Jenna answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to be in charge of my own destiny. Being put on the path to being a mermaid wasn&rsquo;t my choice. Maybe if I&rsquo;d had a chance to choose&hellip; but I won&rsquo;t have it forced on me by circumstance,&rdquo; Sarah concluded, getting up and walking away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manami?&rdquo; Jenna asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, I want to be part of a family, but, I want to go home too. I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she concluded, getting up and heading back into the raft herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no reason we can&rsquo;t enjoy each other,&rdquo; Jenna said, turning back to Josh and kissing him on the lips for the first time, running her hands over his wide shoulders and chest. Josh returned her kiss, and running his hands up and down her back, finally, hugging her close, his arms so long and her body so slim that he could cross his arms behind her back and rub the breast on the opposite side of her chest as he hugged her. Jenna broke the kiss, and leaned back, panting, letting him move his hands to undo the clasp of her bra and free her slowly expanding breasts. She shifted her left leg around to straddle him; locking her ankles together behind his back and ground her pelvis into his lap. She smiled and moaned as she felt Josh&rsquo;s hardness through their clothes. Josh pushed his pelvis up as much as he could, only a few layers of fabric separating him from the sex of this goddess that was moaning under his ministrations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be my beautiful pink mermaid. We&rsquo;ll wrap our tails around each other and make love in the water for hours. I&rsquo;ll love you forever, your merman. I&rsquo;ll be yours forever,&rdquo; he told her as he rubbed one of her breasts from base to nipple. Josh started running his hands all over the bare parts of her body. He slowly ran his hands up her legs from her knees, to the edge of her shorts, then up her sides, under and over her breasts, he kissed her long graceful neck and down along her clavicle. Jenna was panting in her passion. He finally reached down and began rubbing her sex through the fabric of her shorts. She moaned loudly again under his touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, make me your mermaid, a pink mermaid, a pretty pink mermaid! Make me look how you want me, pink all over, yes, YES!&rdquo; she yelled as she came, shuddering and clutching herself to him. He held her gently, as she came down, a drowsy, happy look on her face and put her head on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for the real thing,&rdquo; she said, enjoying the closeness with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; he replied as he gently kissed her bare shoulder. &ldquo;Pink all over?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a thought I had. Something I want to try, a surprise for when we change on the island,&rdquo; she replied, then yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was the one that was supposed to roll over and fall asleep,&rdquo; he joked. &ldquo;Actually, I think it&rsquo;s time for a siesta too,&rdquo; he stood and carried Jenna over to the lean-to and lay down with her. She never stopped clutching herself to him, and together, they took a nice afternoon nap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did she do that?&rdquo; Manami asked Sarah after the moaning died down outside the raft. She laid her head against the older woman&rsquo;s shoulder. Sarah had taken on a maternal role for Manami over the fortnight they&rsquo;d been on the atoll. It wasn&rsquo;t something Sarah was accustomed to, but strangely, she found herself falling into it easily. Manami&rsquo;s grief over the loss of her sister seemed to soften, though sometimes, late at night, Sarah still woke to the sounds of soft sobbing, and she&rsquo;d hug Manami to her and gently console her until she fell silent again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They think they&rsquo;re doing what&rsquo;s best for all of us,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not being very considerate of our feelings though, are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Manami agreed. &ldquo;But if what the mermaids said was right, we will be with them anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that. I don&rsquo;t believe you can make someone love someone else. You have to accept them on some level. Love has to come from the heart,&rdquo; she said gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you were a romantic,&rdquo; Manami was surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I am. Not for myself, mind you. I gave up on finding someone years ago; but it&rsquo;s nice to think that people like Josh and Jenna, who obviously share the same dream, can find each other,&rdquo; Sarah said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really not like Josh? You are very angry when you talk to him. He&rsquo;s been nice,&rdquo; Manami asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josh is&hellip; okay. When he came in and hugged us all that first day to help support you, that was very nice; but in my experience, men will do things like that just to get into bed with women,&rdquo; Sarah sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you just said&hellip;&rdquo; Manami responded, raising her head to look at Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but remember, my romanticism doesn&rsquo;t extend to men I actually know,&rdquo; Sarah said with a wry smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that why you were alone for so long?&rdquo; Manami asked. She immediately regretted asking the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess so,&rdquo; Sarah said, a tear coming to her eye. &ldquo;Like I said, romantic at heart, but I got cynical about the men around me. They always disappointed me, so I just stopped letting people in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay sweetie. You know that I&rsquo;ll support you, whether you come back with me or join them,&rdquo; Sarah said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does sound nice, doesn&rsquo;t it? Being loved all the time like that, being a family,&rdquo; Manami choked back tears. &ldquo;Swimming free, finding food easily. No job to worry about; doesn&rsquo;t it sound good Sarah?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re forgetting about the fact that people will be after you,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Remember what they said about their leaders worrying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess, but on their island, it sounds like there are lots of mers to protect each other,&rdquo; Manami responded. Sarah didn&rsquo;t respond, she seemed to shut down, not wanting to argue the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did join them, would you stay and be a mermaid with us?&rdquo; Manami asked timidly.</p>
<p>Sarah turned away, awash with emotion. The answer to the question whether or not to be a mermaid had always been an unequivocal &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but Manami&rsquo;s words and reflecting on her own loneliness had caused her to waiver for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Sarah responded. She got up to take a walk, leaving Manami alone, each woman lost in their own thoughts.</p>
<p>Jenna awoke from her nap mid-afternoon to the sound of Josh&rsquo;s soft snoring. She gently shook him awake. &ldquo;Hello there,&rdquo; she said when he finally regained consciousness. He smiled back at her, admiring her silently. &ldquo;I was serious about what I said before, I want to change faster. The mers could come back any time, and I want to be as close to changing as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the headpieces, didn&rsquo;t Rose say that they&rsquo;d help focus the change or something like that?&rdquo; Josh said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m such a blonde sometimes,&rdquo; she said. She raced to the scrub bush where they&rsquo;d hung the headpieces, and picked up her tiara and the headband Rose had made for Josh. She handed his head piece to him when she got back. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep these on, especially when we&rsquo;re in the water, and concentrate on what we want to look like as much a possible. Maybe it&rsquo;ll help,&rdquo; she said hopefully.</p>
<p>Josh put his headband on. &ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like you need to go for a swim,&rdquo; Jenna replied, slipping on her own tiara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that&rsquo;s your tiara, not Sarah&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It just felt right when I picked it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the lean to together and headed out into the lagoon, and spent the rest of the day seeing the reefs and collecting food.</p>
<p>Jenna awoke one morning to the sounds of loud splashing in the lagoon. In the two weeks since she and Josh had started wearing their headpieces, the changes had indeed accelerated. Her hair had grown down to her waist and developed a soft curl. She&rsquo;d discarded her bra a week before, since her breasts had gotten much too large for it. Walking around topless just didn&rsquo;t seem like that big a deal any more; Josh certainly didn&rsquo;t seem to mind, as she&rsquo;d caught him looking once, which made him blush furiously. She wasn&rsquo;t this aggressive with men usually, but she felt attracted to Josh more and more as time went by.</p>
<p>As she looked at him now, from her usual spot with her head pillowed on his shoulder, she marveled at the changes he&rsquo;d undergone. He still refused to take his shirt off, even though she could see that he now had a fit, muscular body. He now had to tie his belt around his waist to keep his shorts from falling down. Over the three weeks since they&rsquo;d started wearing their headpieces, his hair had filled in and grown down to near his shoulders. She kissed the tip of his nose and stroked his hair.</p>
<p>Josh woke up with the best view in the world. It just didn&rsquo;t get better than waking up to that face with those beautiful blue eyes smiling down at him. It never ceased to amaze Josh just how nice having someone curled up against him each night was. He had to admit, Jenna&rsquo;s idea about wearing the headpieces had proven right. Their changes had sped up considerably since they&rsquo;d put them on. He felt better than ever; old injuries had healed, he could swim the whole day collecting food and chasing her without getting tired.</p>
<p>A squeal followed by clicking noises from the lagoon drew his attention. He looked and saw a grey shape splash down into the water of the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dolphins,&rdquo; Jenna said. She got up and jogged down into the water, disappearing into the waves to play with their new visitors. Josh stood and watched. The dolphins were spinner dolphins. The largest adults were about eight feet long and they appeared to be traveling in a pod of about 20 individuals. They got their name from their tendency to come flying out of the water, barrel rolling in a social display. Josh saw Jenna swimming amongst them now, petting them as they circled her and laughing as a juvenile jumped and spun in the air, crashing into the water and splashing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey ladies, there are dolphins in the lagoon,&rdquo; he called towards the raft before joining Jenna in the water. He walked out and dove in. As he got into about four feet of water, three dolphins started circling him, checking him out to make sure that he wasn&rsquo;t a threat to their calves. He must have passed their test, because they quickly squeaked and swam off. Josh dived down once he got to deeper water and saw dolphins playing, and Jenna swimming among them. Her long legs and beautiful curves were shown off to great effect as she twisted and turned with the dolphins. He watched her playfully rub the belly of a passing infant as he clicked in happiness. He felt the pressure in his lungs building, and headed up for air, as he hit the surface, one of the females playfully rubbed up against him and squeaked what he supposed was a greeting. &ldquo;Hello there,&rdquo; he said as he pet her gently. &ldquo;Sorry, but I&rsquo;m spoken for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darn right you are!&rdquo; Jenna said from behind him, where she had resurfaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good grief!&rdquo; he practically jumped out of the water. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re good at sneaking up on people,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just keeping you on your toes&hellip; at least for as long as you have them,&rdquo; she grinned and grabbed at his shirt from the front. He reached up to take her hand when the female dolphin he&rsquo;d been petting grabbed the back of his shirt and pulled. The shirt had survived a plane crash, having pieces torn off for bandages, and being worn heavily for weeks, but the force of being pulled from two directions at once was too much for the seams, and they pulled apart with a loud rip. The front and back were now only attached by a few threads at the collar. Josh looked down in surprise. &ldquo;Oops!&rdquo; Jenna chuckled. &ldquo;Well, no reason for y&rsquo;all to keep it now,&rdquo; she smiled at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh funny girls,&rdquo; Josh kidded back. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t know better, I&rsquo;d say you two planned it, but I know you don&rsquo;t speak dolphin,&rdquo; he said as he pulled the remains of his shirt off, revealing a well-muscled chest and toned abs devoid of hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet; I don&rsquo;t speak dolphin yet,&rdquo; Jenna emphasized as she pressed herself against him. They stared into each other&rsquo;s eyes and took in the moment as the dolphins played around them in the warm, perfectly azure water of the lagoon.</p>
<p>Josh lifted his hand and gently caressed her face. &ldquo;Is this great or what?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost perfect,&rdquo; she said, and leaned in for a kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; came a call from the shore. &ldquo;Are they friendly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re dolphins!&rdquo; Jenna called back. &ldquo;Get in here and have some fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami took a few hesitant steps toward the water, but then she froze. She looked back at Sarah, trying to find confidence. Sarah was suspicious of Jenna&rsquo;s motives, but this looked like fun, and once wouldn&rsquo;t hurt. Sarah smiled at Manmi, &ldquo;Go ahead dear, you&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Sarah put her hand on Manami&rsquo;s shoulder, hoping that she&rsquo;d be able to handle encountering sea creatures that were a similar size, shape, and color to the sharks that had eaten her sister&rsquo;s corpse without causing a panic attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come with me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Sarah responded.</p>
<p>They walked out slowly into the water, Sarah&rsquo;s arm around Manami&rsquo;s shoulder. When they hit about waist depth, several dolphins began circling them. They kept walking until they were chest deep, when an infant began showing off for them by swimming around on his back. He splashed water at them with his flukes and made a sound not unlike laughter. Sarah actually laughed at the display as Manami flinched at the splashing and started backing away. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just a baby dear,&rdquo; Sarah reassured her.</p>
<p>Two adults seemed to sense Manami&rsquo;s unease, for they calmly and slowly approached her in the water, gently nuzzling, clicking and squeaking as they rubbed against her. One of the adults slowly passed in front of Manami and rolled onto her side. The dolphin looked Manami right in the eye and let out a low, sad series of sounds, almost as if it was consoling her. The young Japanese woman felt a tear roll down her cheek. She reached out and petted her new friend. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said quietly, and smiled for the first time in weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dolphin therapy: it&rsquo;s good for what ails you,&rdquo; Josh whispered to Jenna as they watched Manami and Sarah pet the visitors to their lagoon. Jenna nodded slightly.</p>
<p>The survivors stayed in the water and played with the dolphins for the rest of the morning, stopping only to collect food. The dolphins moved on at dusk that evening to hunt in the scattering layer of the deep ocean. It had been a wonderful break from their daily routine. It had also been exhausting though, and after dinner, the four of them watched the sun go down over their atoll, and fell asleep under the stars on the beach, Jenna curled around Josh and Sarah Manami lined up in a row next to them.</p>
<p>Jenna was frustrated, again. While the four survivors weren&rsquo;t really keeping track of the passage of days, she reckoned that it had to be at least three weeks since the mers had left them. The plan Rose had told her had been for a month, maybe six weeks of letting the siren cells grow in their bodies long enough for Manami and Sarah to come around and join them. Manami and Sarah didn&rsquo;t seem to be any more interested yet! The tiaras hadn&rsquo;t been part of the plan, she&rsquo;d made that up as she&rsquo;d gone along. Now here they were, she and Josh practically looked like mers minus tails and gills, ready to feed again on mermaid milk and finish changing, and the mers had abandoned them! She needed to talk to someone with a tail, because this frankly sucked.</p>
<p>Jenna was in about seven feet of water out in the lagoon. She was bobbing up and down, switching between breathing and concentrating on talking through the tiara, or whatever they did. No one seemed to be listening at the moment, or maybe she just wasn&rsquo;t talking right. The one thing that was happening was the tingling and twitching all over her body. It was weird, but she could handle that if it meant that a message would get through to the mers.</p>
<p>Josh woke up later than usual (One benefit of being marooned on a deserted atoll: no job to get up early for.), so he wasn&rsquo;t completely surprised that Jenna wasn&rsquo;t curled up with him, but he hadn&rsquo;t seen her in a couple of hours. &ldquo;Have either of you seen Jenna?&rdquo; he finally asked the other two women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sorry,&rdquo; Sarah replied. Manami just shook her head and went back to practicing weaving palm fronds to try to expand the lean-to and build other shelter if the raft ever became unusable. Josh headed out into the lagoon to look for her. What he didn&rsquo;t see was Sarah staring at him. Though she would never admit it out loud, the feelings of attraction she had when she looked at him, or Jenna or Manami for that matter, were undeniable. Where was this coming from? The, what had they called them, siren cells, or maybe just being around two people that were obviously heavily under the influence of them? Josh wasn&rsquo;t so bad, especially now that he had taken his shirt off and was showing off those pecs&hellip; dammit, she didn&rsquo;t want this! She tried running the last quarter&rsquo;s financials through her head again, maybe that would help.</p>
<p>Josh eventually found Jenna, still trying to communicate with the mers. &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; she said dejectedly. &ldquo;I feel kind of funny when I concentrate on the mers, but I&rsquo;m okay now,&rdquo; she pouted. She smiled languidly as she wrapped her arms around his shoulders. &ldquo;Maybe you can console me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, you were tingling?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Are you alright? Where were you tingling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of all over, but it seemed to be most intense on my back, and these,&rdquo; she pressed her chest into his.</p>
<p>He smiled. They seemed to be unable to keep their hands off each other. Not that he was complaining, mind you. Were her breasts even bigger? They were! He moved to chest deep water, and now that he had purchase, she wrapped her legs around his waist and leaned in to kiss him. He ran his hands up and down her back, which did feel a little different along two strips on either side of her spine. Jenna moaned and broke the kiss. He moved down her long neck to her clavicle, kissing all along the way. He kissed his way down her beautiful chest, slowly wrapping his tongue around her right nipple, drawing it to his mouth, and taking in as much of her breast as possible. Jenna was panting now. She ground her crotch into his abs. It was so hard to keep from stripping off her underwear and begging him to take her. Josh played with her other nipple with his right hand. Jenna felt her orgasm building as Josh lavished attention on her chest. She was going to cum just from him playing with her boobs! &ldquo;Oh! Josh! Yes!&rdquo; she clenched her legs around him and pulled his head down onto her breast as hard as she could as she came. As she came, she felt something in her breasts let down, and a feeling she&rsquo;d never had before as something actually came out of her nipples.</p>
<p>Josh was caught off guard by something spurting into his mouth. He sputtered and drew back from her breast. &ldquo;What the hell?!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Jenna finally came down from her orgasm and realized Josh had said something. She opened her eyes and saw Josh&rsquo;s wide-eyed, open-mouthed expression as he looked at her chest. She looked down and saw a white liquid running down from both of her nipples. Josh recognized the taste. It wasn&rsquo;t as strong as what he&rsquo;d tasted before, not as sweet, but it was unmistakable. &ldquo;Mermaid milk,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>It all made sense now to Jenna. A plan quickly formed in her head. &ldquo;Drink. I want you to drink from me now,&rdquo; she pulled his head down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said and pulled his head back. &ldquo;You really think we can-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;-change all the way? Yes,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Not right now, but if you keep drinking from me and I keep changing, we can be mers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh didn&rsquo;t say a word. They shared a moment of silence. &ldquo;This, feeding from you, is really weird isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He asked in a moment of trepidation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we want to be mers it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jenna replied. &ldquo;Go on dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh slowly lowered his head back down to her right breast and drew the nipple into his mouth. He gently sucked and felt her milk flow. Jenna moaned at the thought of what this would do to them, what it offered. She wanted to be one with the ocean, to dive deep, see its wonders, and feel its caress as she moved through the water. It was like the description of Hell in Dante&rsquo;s Inferno: She had had her life, then a fiery, horrible, painful death in the plane crash and on the raft. But the key to leaving Hell in the Inferno was to stop fighting, to stop doing the thing that kept you in Hell. She and Josh had never fought, and so were quickly passing through this purgatory and would embrace the heaven of a life in the sea. If only Sarah and Manami would stop fighting it, they could pass into the heaven of being a mer. Perfect love, perfectly suited to their situation, isn&rsquo;t that Heaven, or as close as we can get on Earth?</p>
<p>She looked down as Josh switched to her left breast. This certainly wasn&rsquo;t how she&rsquo;d expected to meet the man she would spend the rest of her life with. She stroked Josh&rsquo;s hair as he fed. What would her parents think of him, if she saw them again? Never mind him; what would they think of their only child the mermaid? She hoped to find out someday. Jenna supposed they&rsquo;d just be relieved she was alive; at least that&rsquo;s what she wanted to believe. They&rsquo;d gone to church, and been good, G-d fearing people, would they handle this? Breast feeding a full grown man would probably be a bit much, but if it meant they found her alive, with a grandchild to boot maybe, not lost in a plane crash&hellip; She shed a tear, thinking of how the news of her death would have hurt her parents and friends back home. Josh finished feeding and lifted his gaze to her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you okay?&rdquo; he asked when he saw her face. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong, did I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she shook her head. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;all were fine. I just started thinking of my parents towards the end there. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve been declared dead. I&rsquo;m an only child; my parents must have been devastated when they heard,&rdquo; she started really crying now. She laid her head on Josh&rsquo;s shoulder and he held her as she cried herself out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brought this on?&rdquo; he asked her once she settled down. &ldquo;Are you having second thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she lifted her head to face him. &ldquo;I thought about how I never thought I&rsquo;d meet a husband this way; that led to thinking of what Mom and Daddy would think of y&rsquo;all and our kids, and I realized that they think I&rsquo;m dead,&rdquo; she choked back fresh tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said, wiping her tears away. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know much about the mers' situation though. They aren&rsquo;t generally known, but, maybe there&rsquo;s a way we can send them a message&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to make me feel better, and I appreciate it, but we both know we can&rsquo;t go sending messages around to people the mers don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were really thinking about our kids?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was. I don&rsquo;t want kids right after we change, but some day. Is that okay with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would love to have children with you,&rdquo; he said, then looked at her thoughtfully for a moment. &ldquo;Do you think your parents will accept our unique situation?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Come to think of it, it might help if there were grandkids involved when we met them. All through college Mom was &lsquo;I hope you meet a nice young man and make me a gramma before I&rsquo;m too old to remember their names!&rsquo; all the time,&rdquo; Jenna rolled her eyes as she finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your Dad?&rdquo; Josh prodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about him, he only ever pulled his shotgun on one of my boyfriends,&rdquo; she smiled slyly and pushed away from him. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get lunch,&rdquo; she said as she swam away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were kidding about the shotgun, right?&rdquo; he called after her.</p>
<p>Josh was walking along the edge of the lagoon the next day. He&rsquo;d fed from Jenna that morning, and he could feel her milk coursing through him, building and changing him inside out. At low tide, the gaps between a couple of the islands that made up the atoll were no larger than a small creek, so he took the opportunity to take a long walk alone. Maybe he could work out some of the agitation he&rsquo;d felt since this morning. He pushed his now long hair out of his face, annoyed. His dark brown hair was halfway down his back now, just like Trevor&rsquo;s. How did women deal with this? It combined with the tingling and set him on edge. He stopped and sighed; he could say it was the hair, the changes going on his body, or even Sarah&rsquo;s intransigence, but he&rsquo;d be lying to himself. He wanted to be a merman, he was looking forward to being able to swim deep and stay under as long as he wanted.</p>
<p>He was still worried about the responsibility he was taking on. He looked across the ocean side of the island he found himself on, the deep blue of the ocean topped by the white caps, the roar of the surf hitting the outer reefs; the turmoil of the sea mirrored his mind. He and Jenna were stepping ever closer to their goal, and that scared the hell out of him. Are these the feelings people went through before their wedding day? This was even more momentous, considering that he wasn&rsquo;t just putting a ring on her finger, but changing species and biologically bonding to her for life. He&rsquo;d never been good with relationships; his last one had failed spectacularly when his girlfriend had refused to move to Singapore with him and had broken off contact. She wasn&rsquo;t to blame, Josh had asked too much from a woman who&rsquo;d never left her home state, who&rsquo;d never even gotten on a plane. He hadn&rsquo;t even thought of her for months, having thrown himself into his new job and new city. It seemed like a lifetime ago.</p>
<p>Maybe it had been a lifetime, after the harrowing experience they&rsquo;d gone through; the four of them had nearly died twice, and he&rsquo;d let Pham Na die by his own failure to react. The memory of that day came back. He knew consciously that it hadn&rsquo;t been his fault. Pham Na had chosen to try to swim off with the water filter. It was Pham Na&rsquo;s own damn fault that he&rsquo;d jumped out of the boat and swum away into an area filled with feeding sharks! No more; no more feeling sorry for himself, no more doubts. He had been given an opportunity only a few people on the planet ever got, and he would take it and not look back.</p>
<p>He turned from the ocean and walked back through the palms to the interior of the lagoon. It turned out that he stood opposite of their camp site. It was so clear he could see the bright orange raft from his vantage point. It was a two mile swim, but he felt up to it. Walking into the lagoon, he dove beneath the surface and started swimming.</p>
<p>Back at the beach, Jenna, Sarah, and Manami were enjoying a shellfish and coconut lunch. Jenna had brought the shellfish, while Manami had gathered coconuts and Sarah shucked and shelled the meal. They had started eating quietly, but Jenna eventually noticed the other two women stealing glances at her. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up girls?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long has Josh been drinking from you?&rdquo; Sarah demanded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deny it, I saw you this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we were having such a nice lunch; what do y&rsquo;all care? Y&rsquo;all are leaving once the mers come back, so what&rsquo;s the big deal what Josh and I do?&rdquo; Jenna replied angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters because what you two do affects us. You&rsquo;ve been pushing to change, and I think it&rsquo;s&hellip; I can&rsquo;t speak for Manami, but I think I&rsquo;ve been affected by being around you,&rdquo; Sarah said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; asked a concerned Jenna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel attracted to&hellip;&rdquo; Sarah started to appear upset. &ldquo;Josh mostly, but sometimes I think of you, and Manami too. I don&rsquo;t want you to go away, but you&rsquo;ve b-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could y&rsquo;all have been a big company executive and be so blind?&rdquo; Jenna replied, exasperated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think you are? You and Josh just drag us along into Mermaid Fantasy Land without asking and expect Manami and I to be okay with it?&rdquo; she shot back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect you to be rational. Y&rsquo;all were given milk the same way Josh and I were, it&rsquo;s only natural that it&rsquo;s affecting you,&rdquo; Jenna said firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarah,&rdquo; Manami said quietly. &ldquo;When we talked, you said you might become a mermaid if I did,&rdquo; The statement hung in the air for a moment. Manami looked back and forth at the two other women. Her culture valued harmony within the group, and she&rsquo;d tried to bring Sarah and Jenna together through Sarah&rsquo;s seemingly latent desire to be a mermaid and Jenna&rsquo;s obvious desire for it. It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I might want to,&rdquo; Sarah said through clenched teeth. She was furious; how dare Manami betray her confidence like that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do whatever, I don&rsquo;t care at this point. I won&rsquo;t let y&rsquo;all&rsquo;s shitty attitude bring down Josh and I. Manami, I hope you join us, I&rsquo;d love to call you a sister-wife,&rdquo; Jenna said, throwing her arms up in frustration.</p>
<p>The beach got very quiet then. The three women just cast looks at each other. Manami opened her mouth to say something she thought might be helpful, but an angry look from Sarah shut her down. Jenna looked toward the lagoon. She felt the need to wrap her arms around Josh and lay her head against his chest; that always made her feel better.</p>
<p>Josh was out in the lagoon. The eastern end of which was a very long sloping plain of sand. It was shallow enough that a great plain of sea grass grew on the bottom. He grabbed handfuls of the edible grass as he went eating on the go, kicking his way underwater across the lagoon. He loved being underwater. It was as close to flying without a plane as he could get. The only thing holding him back was the ungainly feel of his swimming motion. He just felt slow! That and having to breathe. That thought stopped him in his tracks. He floated vertically in the water. How long had he been down here?</p>
<p>He was at a point where the lagoon was getting too deep for the grass to grow. Josh floated in about 12 feet of water, fish swimming by, the sun rippled through the crystal blue water in rays that danced across the sea floor and the rocks and corals in the distant, deeper parts of the lagoon. This was peace, this was beauty; who wouldn&rsquo;t want to live in and be one with a place like this? All of the stress of worrying about who would or wouldn&rsquo;t be what fell away. He loved Jenna, with every bit of his soul. As long as she was with him, he didn&rsquo;t need to share this place with anyone else.</p>
<p>He awoke from his reverie. He hadn&rsquo;t been counting, but he knew he should have needed a breath of air by now. He felt fine; there was absolutely no tightness in his chest or urgency to take a gulp of air. So that was what all of that tingling on his back had been from: his gills had grown in. Well, how about that that? he thought as he smiled.</p>
<p>Jenna had to know about this! Full of exuberance, he kicked as hard as he could toward the western end of the lagoon. The water deepened under him to about 35 feet, and as he swam above the coral formations and the fish that swam in and around them, he spotted a strange sight: a horseshoe formation of rock, no more than 15 feet tall. A lattice of fan coral had formed over the top and sides, making it impossible to swim in through the top. Josh wanted to check it out, but this news was too important. He filed away the surrounding landmarks and headed up to the surface to check where he was.</p>
<p>When he broke the surface, he looked around and found that he was just about halfway across the lagoon. He could see the bright orange raft on the beach just ahead, and the side of the lagoon he&rsquo;d set off from on the other. The girls were still invisible to him, but he at least had his bearings. Ducking his head beneath the surface again, he sank to about ten feet and began swimming for the beach.</p>
<p>Lunch was long over, but the three women were experiencing a decided disadvantage of being stuck on a deserted island: there was nothing to distract them from each other. No books, TV, internet. Sure, you could leave, but what would you do, sulk somewhere else? They&rsquo;d been on the island for so long that they&rsquo;d shared their stories, twice sometimes, in the case of Sarah&rsquo;s one story about that casino in Macau and the conference of Japanese and Korean tech executives who&rsquo;d had an unfortunate incident with Tequila and a flock of flamingoes, but really, there was a limit to such things. The result was that Jenna and Sarah were avoiding looking each other in the eye, and Manami was furtively looking back and forth at the two Americans, trying to think of something to say.</p>
<p>Finally, relief came as, seemingly from nowhere, Josh broke the surface, standing up in the shallows near the water&rsquo;s edge. He had a huge smile on his face as he trudged up onto the beach. Jenna jumped up and ran to him. She hugged herself close to him and the two of them exchanged a kiss. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You too,&rdquo; she replied back as she ran her hand down the front of his chest. For a moment, it seemed strange to her that she was so relieved to see him again, but she let that feeling pass. It was just such a comforting feeling to be with him. &ldquo;I thought you went for a walk?&rdquo; she asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, but when I got to the other side of the atoll, I decided to try swimming back. I just kind of lost track of how long I was down there and noticed&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noticed what?&rdquo; Sarah asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I can breathe underwater,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see!&rdquo; Jenna exclaimed as she wiggled out of his grasp and moved around to his back. The young woman lifted his hair and saw the two long lines of gills that ran down either side of his spine. She noticed that his gills differed from the mermaids' in that the pink areas were concentrated in the upper half of his back, hidden by his hair, instead of running the full length of his backbone. She ran her finger down one of his gills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey now!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he shivered at her touch. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not exactly a restful sensation, if you take my meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh really?&rdquo; Jenna responded in sultry tone as she very slowly, very gently teased her hands up and down his back. &ldquo;Stroking a mer&rsquo;s gills feels good? That&rsquo;s nice to know,&rdquo; she kept stroking his back, watching his muscles flex, his broad shoulders shift, and feeling his breathing deepen as he grew aroused by her actions. &ldquo;Okay, that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; she said softly as she stopped; &ldquo;Show me,&rdquo; she said as she headed for the water.</p>
<p>Josh let out a growl as the feeling subsided. He was facing Sarah and Manami, who had been watching the whole time. He raised an eyebrow at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me like that; I&rsquo;m not stroking any part of you,&rdquo; Sarah said as she folded her arms. Manami just looked embarrassed and hid her face with her hair. Josh shrugged his shoulders and followed Jenna towards the surf. Jenna hit the water first and started freestyle swimming along the surface. Josh dove down and disappeared once he hit deep enough water.</p>
<p>Sarah let out a sigh and shuddered. It was taking all of her willpower to keep from giving into these feelings. She felt passion, love even, for Josh. There was no logical explanation for it, they had almost nothing in common, and he&rsquo;d done nothing to win her over, and he was just way too young for her. Why was this desire the only thing happening to her? She could have at least gotten younger looking or something. She looked up and saw Manami looking at her. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked the younger woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home just seems so far away right now,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;I keep thinking about how I can face my parents. I was supposed to look after Miki, but..,&rdquo; she sniffled. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to just stay here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get home if you really want to,&rdquo; Sarah said as she placed her hand on Manami&rsquo;s shoulder for support. She couldn&rsquo;t really blame Manami for feeling that way. She&rsquo;d come far in the time they&rsquo;d been on the island. From barely leaving the raft, she&rsquo;d progressed to helping prepare meals and weaving palm fronds. The &ldquo;dolphin therapy&rdquo; had been good for her as well. The pain of the loss of her sister had faded from a sharp knife to the heart, to a dull, aching emptiness. There simply wasn&rsquo;t a way to replace the loss of a close sibling. They just sat together for a while, each woman, once again, left with nothing but the inexorable pull of their old lives and the promises whispered by a life in the sea.</p>
<p>Jenna swam hard out into the lagoon. About 40 yards out, she stopped and looked around for Josh, and she didn&rsquo;t see him. Just as she was starting to get concerned, she was suddenly pulled underwater and kissed on her lips. It was Josh&rsquo;s turn to surprise her. They kissed passionately for about a minute, floating up to the surface, where they broke their kiss. &ldquo;See what I mean? I haven&rsquo;t had a breath of air since we left the beach,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo; Jenna exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so close I can almost feel my fins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found something else on the way back that I want to show you,&rdquo; Josh said. &ldquo;I think it could be important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Jenna asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember what the mers said about a ceremony that takes place when they changed?&rdquo; Jenna nodded in response. &ldquo;I think we need a safe place to do it underwater. Follow me, let me know if you need air,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He dove down, heading diagonally towards the middle of the lagoon, keeping a steady pace so that Jenna could keep up, he headed off diagonally, watching the bottom for the shape of the grotto he&rsquo;d found. Jenna stopped him about 20 feet down for a breath. He pulled her to him and breathed into her mouth, let her breath in again as his gills refilled his lungs, then gave her a second hit of air. She backed off and gave him a thumbs up, and they continued on down. Eventually, the coral-shrouded horseshoe loomed into view. Josh pulled up short and let her catch up, taking a moment to take in the beauty of the corals and sand along the bottom of the lagoon. The colors highlighted by the rippling sunlight. The fan coral that covered the horseshoe of rock as a lattice of color that was beautiful to behold.</p>
<p>Josh led the two of them around, looking for a way through the coral. Eventually, they found an opening between two fans of coral near the base of the dome. Swimming into the center of the rocky horseshoe, they stopped for a breath for Jenna, she pulled back and looked around, immediately seeing the possibilities of the space. It didn&rsquo;t appear to be popular for any of the reef sharks or larger fish, and the water was even calmer than the rest of the lagoon. The walls were sparsely populated with coral, leaving a large interior space. The fan coral that covered the opening was thinner, letting light filter down into the space. The sandy bottom was free of debris, the coral above being untouched over the years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what I mean?&rdquo; he asked Jenna. She nodded back to him. He caught her eyes and found himself lost in those big pools of ice blue. He could see the emotion in her eyes, the contemplation of their eventual change and new life together. Her long, honey blonde hair fanned out around her in a golden halo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said in a stream of bubbles. Why hadn&rsquo;t he ever said it before? They&rsquo;d had such a strange romance, a combination of biological mer-bonding and shared dreams forming into a strange mix of affection. Did they love each other, or were they in love with what they were about to become? Did that even matter?</p>
<p>Jenna didn&rsquo;t care how long it had taken him to say it; those words were music to her ears. She pulled him in for a kiss (that also gave her another breath), then raised her breast to him in an invitation to feed. He smiled and began feed from her again. Jenna&rsquo;s milk tasted stronger than ever, she was producing more and more Siren Cells. He felt her running her hand through the hair on the side of his head, then trace around his ear. He relaxed and concentrated on feeling the milk run down his throat; a warm rivulet of sweetness that filled him with feelings of love and contentment. After a while, he felt her milk start to run dry, he lifted his head and look up at her &ldquo;Need a breath?&rdquo; he asked. She shook her head, so he went to work on her other breast.</p>
<p>As he finished, he pulled back and went to give Jenna more air. She had to need air by now. She stopped him with a hand to his chest. &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; he bubbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she tested, releasing a bubble of her own. She paused, concentrating on something within her. Josh realized that she was trying to feel whether or not she needed more air. He saw her chest rise again, filling with, what, air?</p>
<p>He spun her around suddenly and moved her hair aside. Right there in front of him was the reason her back had been tingling. Two gills running the length of her spine connected to her lungs, pulling in oxygen and sloughing off carbon dioxide. He ran a finger up and down the length of her right gill. It was Jenna&rsquo;s turn to shiver in delight at the feelings caused by the stimulation of her sensitive new organs.</p>
<p>She spun herself back around in the water and pulled at his pants. This was it; they were going to do it. It was time to force the issue and change all the way. Josh was dumbfounded, but he went along with it. He helped undo the knot in his belt and undressed, then watched Jenna pull down her underwear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think about me as a mermaid,&rdquo; she said. He nodded and began to concentrate. He thought about Jenna as she was now, then concentrated on her legs merging together and erupting in pink scales. Her hair growing even longer, webbing growing on her hands. They grasped hands and concentrated as hard as they could on Jenna&rsquo;s tail. She felt power building inside her. It was like an engine starting in slow motion, all of the Siren Cells moving, she felt things grinding inside her, starting the process&hellip;</p>
<p>Except it didn&rsquo;t happen; there just weren&rsquo;t enough of the cells to affect such a radical change. They stopped for a moment to recover from the effort of concentration. &ldquo;Again,&rdquo; Jenna urged after a few minutes' break. They started concentrating again, trying to will her body to change. Jenna clenched Josh&rsquo;s hands so hard they went numb from lack of circulation. The power built, and built, and built, their bodies practically vibrating under the strain&hellip;but they simply could not push the cells into the full change. After an hour of trying, the strain was just too much; they stopped, their gills working overtime trying to pull in more oxygen for their tired bodies. Jenna heard Josh&rsquo;s stomach growl extremely loudly.</p>
<p>Josh looked into Jenna&rsquo;s eyes. She had the saddest, most tired look possible on her face. He reached down and gently kissed her, then found her underwear and gently pulled it up her legs. After finding his clothes and putting them back on, he gave Jenna a quick kiss. She was still floating upright in the water, looking very tired. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get some food, okay?&rdquo; She nodded back to him, and he swam off, leaving her to recover in the protected grotto.</p>
<p>Jenna waited, letting the water soothe her and trying to feel her new gills work. She released her air, letting it bubble up and away, and tried to concentrate on feeling her lungs fill. It just felt like taking a slow, deep breath, but without the effort of her diaphragm. She floated, looking up at the sun through the coral and water. She now felt more at home here, even if she wasn&rsquo;t yet a mermaid. She then noticed Josh returning through the opening in the coral, his arms loaded with sea grasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the knife, so no fish or shellfish, we&rsquo;re all veggie,&rdquo; he said as he separated the accumulated kelp and sea grasses and offered a pile to Jenna. He noticed the dreamy look on her face and stopped. &ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; he asked. Shifting the food to cradle it in his left arm, and cradled her face with his right hand. She snapped out of her reverie and smiled that sweet smile that he&rsquo;d come to know over the last couple of months. He ran his hand over the tiara that the mers gave her and her smile widened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just enjoying the scenery,&rdquo; she replied as she took her first handful of food. &ldquo;This looks good. Thank you, I&rsquo;m really hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ate leisurely, though eating underwater was an interesting experience logistically speaking. Both of them felt very tired, so they decided to head back to the beach and the lean-to to rest up. Josh led the way out of the grotto and set a straight diagonal course through the lagoon to the beach. Halfway there, he looked and saw Jenna falling behind, more floating than swimming. She looked dreadfully tired, so he went back, put his arm around her shoulders, and propelled them both back to the surface just at the edge of the shallows at their beach. Once there, he put his left arm under her knees and her left arm around his neck and stood up. She smiled once she realized what he was doing and nuzzled his neck with her nose.</p>
<p>He walked up the beach, right past Manami and Sarah. He could practically feel their eyes on them; they must have made quite a sight in the afternoon sunshine. He gently laid his love down on the palm fronds under the lean-to, laid down next to her, let her situate herself in her usual position, and then they both promptly fell asleep. They didn&rsquo;t wake up until the next morning.</p>
<p>Jenna stared at her hands. In the past few days, she&rsquo;d fed Josh twice a day, like clockwork. They&rsquo;d stayed in the water almost all day; they&rsquo;d even slept floating in the grotto one night, though they lacked the ability to control their depth. That had led to Josh bumping into the fan coral in the middle of the night. Now, the payoff had arrived. She had webbing in her hands. It was halfway up to her first knuckle. Not much, but it was there. Josh walked out from the tree line with several coconuts. He prepared one for Jenna and himself. She silently held up her hand to show him the webbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got ya beat,&rdquo; he said deadpan as he lifted his hand. He had webbing up to his lowest knuckle. &ldquo;I just noticed it this morning too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need more food than this,&rdquo; she said before she drank the milk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; Josh asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; she replied with a smile. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make it quick, before they wake up,&rdquo; Jenna urged as she grabbed the collection bag the mers had left them and headed for the water and slipped in quietly. Josh followed and together they were able to gather up enough shellfish to provide a sizable pile of protein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think we&rsquo;re ready?&rdquo; Josh whispered as they ate quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just, knew,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Even before I saw my hands, I just felt different when I woke up. I know that sounds dumb, but I just can&rsquo;t explain it any other way,&rdquo; she held up her hand. &ldquo;This just confirmed it. We should change now, I know it&rsquo;ll work,&rdquo; she said earnestly as she placed her hand on his. Josh could see the passion in her eyes. Whatever she was feeling, he reasoned, it wasn&rsquo;t something they should ignore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said, and smiled. They dug into their food, eating quickly. They became so engrossed they didn&rsquo;t hear Sarah leave the raft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaving any for the rest of us?&rdquo; she asked warily when she saw how voraciously they were eating. Josh and Jenna stopped and stared at each other. Sarah&rsquo;s eyes widened when she saw the webbing on their hands. She didn&rsquo;t know what that meant. Were they getting feral? Had something gone wrong with the siren cells that was affecting their minds?</p>
<p>Josh and Jenna stopped at the sound of her voice. &ldquo;We were just hungry,&rdquo; Josh said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My ass,&rdquo; Sarah said point-blank. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got webbing on your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do it Sarah. If you want to join us I&rsquo;ll feed you right now, then again after we&rsquo;re done changing,&rdquo; Jenna offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pass,&rdquo; The older woman replied as she crossed her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suit yourself,&rdquo; Jenna shrugged, and then popped another bit of shellfish into her mouth.</p>
<p>Josh and Jenna quickly finished and cleaned up their shells, and made their way to the water&rsquo;s edge. &ldquo;Any last words?&rdquo; Jenna asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never go home again,&rdquo; Sarah said with a hint of desperation in her voice. &ldquo;You will be freaks for the rest of your lives. Your instincts and emotions will rule your minds. People will pursue you and hunt you. You are throwing your lives away, and&hellip; pulling Manami and I down with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenna regarded Sarah for a moment, seeing the look of fear on her face. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be together, for however long that is. We will be rare, beautiful creatures empowered to live in a world people only dream about. Please stop fighting what is going to happen anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josh,&rdquo; Sarah said, imploring him; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve worked for your career for years, you really want to give it up for a fantasy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fantasy is about to be real,&rdquo; his excitement palpable, &ldquo;Everything that really matters, love, a family, is sitting right in front of me, and I&rsquo;m going to reach out and grab them,&rdquo; he reached down and pulled off his shorts and underwear. Jenna smiled and disrobed as well. When he reached down to carry her into the water, she backed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to walk one last time,&rdquo; she smiled and held out her hand to Josh. He took it, and together they turned and walked into the lagoon.</p>
<p>Sarah stood silently on the beach, looking towards where Josh and Jenna had entered the water. She quietly turned and walked back towards the raft, her face screwed into a look of worry. What would she tell Manami? What would she say?</p>
<p>Josh and Jenna swam down through the crystal blue waters of the lagoon, down to the grotto they&rsquo;d found. upon entering, they moved rocks in front of the entrance so that passing predators wouldn&rsquo;t be tempted to enter.</p>
<p>The two of them floated to the center of the enclosed space, staring into each others' eyes. &ldquo;Okay, we&rsquo;re going to do you first,&rdquo; Jenna said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been drinking every day,&rdquo; he nodded and they clasped hands. Josh and Jenna concentrated on his tail. His legs merging, into a single, dark blue limb that ended well below where his feet currently existed. They concentrated on his mer-sense, and the unique skin that would allow him to fly through the water at incredible speeds.</p>
<p>They both began to feel the Siren Cells build, a sense of movement and incredible power poured through their bodies, a rushing, near roaring sound in their ears. They were agonizingly close to getting Josh to change.</p>
<p>Jenna poured her will into changing Josh. It felt like she was sending energy from her body, channeled through her tiara, directly into Josh&rsquo;s body. It was incredibly draining, and she didn&rsquo;t know how long she could keep it up. She started to feel something welling up in her chest, influenced by the Siren Cells. It felt familiar, her eyes flew open, she knew what to do! She reached up and grabbed Josh behind his neck, pulling him down to her breasts. &ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Josh pulled milk from her nipple, feeling the power flowing within his body build to new heights with each spurt. When her first breast ran out, he switched to the second. He felt like he would burst from the energies pouring through him. He fought to hold the image of himself as a merman in his mind. Blue tail, dark blue tail. Kept going through his head.</p>
<p>As he finished with her second breast, the extra Siren Cells from Jenna&rsquo;s milk pushed him over the threshold. The engine of change finally kicked over. He was thrown back from Jenna, his arms spread wide as his head was thrown back. He floated in the center of their grotto, slowly spinning. He began to feel his legs ever so slowly merge into one limb. It seemed to take only minutes to him. Waves of the Siren Cells' power flowed up and down his body. A snapping sound accompanied a sharp pain through his new single limb. His new joints began forming as his leg bones broke and realigned. He felt stretched as his new tail lengthened. He felt a sudden urge to push downward in his abdomen, and he felt parts of him relocate downward as he pushed. As that happened, new, powerful swimming muscles wound their way up into his pelvis and back where they anchored themselves with thick and strong tendons and ligaments.</p>
<p>Jenna had felt immense pressure as energy flowed out of her body into Josh at an even faster rate as she&rsquo;d fed him. As Josh had pulled back, she&rsquo;d felt compelled to hum from deep in her chest. It was amazing to watch him change, but it took so long, his change had persisted throughout the day and into the night. She was at once tired and electrified, as his legs had ever so slowly merged and lengthened. She&rsquo;d winced when she&rsquo;d heard his leg bones break, worried for her love, but she saw that he&rsquo;d borne it and continued on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, within the whirlwind of the change Josh began feeling pressure at four points along his half-formed tail. His mid-tail and pectoral fins pushed their way out, and similar pressure signaled the arrival of his elbow fins.</p>
<p>Another change of direction in the energies flowing through him moved down to what had been his feet. They had merged together with his legs, but the bones hadn&rsquo;t really altered form until now. At this point, the bones that made up his feet and ankles began reshaping into the base of his tail. His heel bones melted away as his ankles changed, and his toes began to lengthen into the supports for his flukes.</p>
<p>As the night became day, a deep blue color began moving up his new tail. Black fringes developed along the tips of his flukes and fins. Slowly, he gained the coloring he&rsquo;d asked for that first night Jenna and he had slept together. Once his tail was done, one last rush went through his body as he felt his tail curl up behind him. A feeling of ecstasy passed through him, and it was over.</p>
<p>Josh the merman saw his new flukes hanging in front of his face, his eyes went wide and he reached out and touched the edge of his fluke. He could feel his hand touching his fluke! He exalted in the new feelings his body was sending him. Straightening himself out, he looked down at his new self. His hands now had blue webbing up to his last knuckle that matched his scales. He was nearly twelve feet long, and while the physique of his upper body had not appeared to have changed much, he was fascinated by the new feelings coming from the muscles in his tail and torso. He didn&rsquo;t really feel quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves anymore, just long, continuous pulls from groups of muscles running the length of his body.</p>
<p>He remembered that mers were supposed to have another sense, electromagnetic, if he remembered what Trevor and Rose had said. He concentrated on feeling the world around him. Stretch out with your feelings! He relaxed and tried to welcome in the information, and he realized that he could sense the fish, coral polyps, anemone, all forms of life in a wide area of the lagoon around him! It was amazing, being connected to every other living thing! It was truly special, feeling life. It was an epiphany, and extremely humbling in its grandeur.</p>
<p>He felt a hand on his left shoulder. He turned to see Jenna, her eyes wide in wonder. He focused on her and felt her awe, apprehension, and love. He was actually feeling her mood and emotions! Their eyes met and they smiled at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; she said. His eyes were beautiful to her. Instead of the brown they&rsquo;d been before, they were the deep navy blue of his tail, and sparkled with the jewel-like light that all of the mers' eyes possessed. She lost herself in them for a moment before Josh pulled her to him and kissed her hard. She broke the kiss and ran her hands along the smooth skin of his torso and the new scales of his tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is incredible. It&rsquo;s better than the mers ever said it was. I can feel everything!&rdquo; he told her as she played with a pelvic fin and moved around to his dorsal ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to change now!&rdquo; she exclaimed as she moved around in front of him, her hands on his chest. He concentrated on her and could tell just how tired she was, and his enhanced hearing could hear the rumbling of her stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need to eat. I&rsquo;ll go get food and you stay here and rest,&rdquo; he said. Jenna looked crestfallen. &ldquo;Fear not my love, you&rsquo;ll be a mermaid soon,&rdquo; he started trying to work out how he&rsquo;d maneuver himself down to the exit in the coral. He shifted to make himself horizontal in the water, which was surprisingly easy; then before he could consciously move downwards, he started to sink on his own until he was level with the exit. His eyes went wide and he looked at Jenna, who was equally impressed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll work,&rdquo; he shrugged. Once he cleared the rocks from in front of the exit, he prepared to propel himself for the first time. Okay, just a short, single stroke, just enough to get me out of here. He raised and lowered his tail with what he thought was a medium amount of force&hellip;</p>
<p>He shot out through the opening at incredible speed, startling Jenna and kicking up sand inside the grotto. Josh was just barely able to figure out how to turn before crashing into a coral outcropping. Now that he was out in the open water, he kept undulating to keep his speed and have some fun. This was what he had daydreamed, streaking through the water at immense speed, nearly effortlessly, just like he&rsquo;d seen marine mammals do for all of those years in nature documentaries. He noticed the nictitating membranes come across his eyes to protect them from the rushing water, and felt a dorsal fin stand up from his back, which seemed to make staying in control easier.</p>
<p>Pulling up in the center of the water column, he relished in the new feelings and this new world. His mer senses let him listen to the universe in a way he&rsquo;d never thought possible for a human. He had streaked through the water faster than a dolphin. He did a loop de loop in the water, laughing uproariously in the joy of his new existence. He stopped when he remembered what he was out here for: food so that Jenna could change! He facepalmed and set to work gathering their usual snack of grasses and protein in record time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jenna was waiting for the sand Josh had kicked up to settle. Her body felt so heavy she was surprised she was still floating. She smiled a lazy smile as she remembered the feeling of touching Josh&rsquo;s new tail. It had been just as smooth as she remembered Kate and Ann&rsquo;s tails being, but there was an electric feeling when she&rsquo;d run her hands over Josh. He was hers, her merman! They&rsquo;d done it! Well, half of it anyway. She wiggled her toes and realized that she likely wouldn&rsquo;t be doing that for very long, well, if Josh ever got back with the food. She was starving, and tired&hellip; but oddly, not as tired as she&rsquo;d been the first time they&rsquo;d tried to change. The Siren Cells must be sustaining them more than they were before.</p>
<p>Her reverie was broken by Josh&rsquo;s return. He appeared to have figured out how to better control his speed, since he slowly glided into the grotto with his arms full of food. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he said as he floated up to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; she said as she smiled with that broad grin that lit up her whole face. She took some sea grasses and got started eating while Josh popped open several shellfish for her and ate some himself.</p>
<p>Josh and Jenna watched each other as they ate. Josh watched her beautiful face in remembrance of the smile that she&rsquo;d just given him. He would truly do anything for this woman. Even though she wasn&rsquo;t yet a mermaid, he felt that their link had strengthened, even if it was just an effect of his added sense, this new insight into living things. He felt her heart beating, the electrical currents running through her nervous system. It had a beauty all its own, and seemed to fit her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked, he was worrying her a little bit with the way he was staring at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry,&rdquo; he replied. Jenna noted that no bubbles came out of his mouth. &ldquo;I was sort of looking at you with my mer senses. It was very interesting,&rdquo; he said before taking another bite of food.</p>
<p>Jenna polished off the last of her food, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell, show me!&rdquo; she demanded as she kissed him, &ldquo;Make me a mermaid,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I supposed to do that?&rdquo; Josh asked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to start squirting milk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just start trying to make me change, you being a mer might be enough,&rdquo; she replied. They were both in the unknown here, but they&rsquo;d managed to turn Josh into a merman. The two of them settled down in the center of the grotto and began concentrating again. They tightly held hands as they felt the same power that had remade Josh flow through their bodies, this time centering on Jenna. The power built and built, but stopped short of kicking into changing Jenna. Jenna opened her eyes as she felt the power plateau. Something else, we need something else&hellip; she thought. She had given something to Josh to trigger his change, what could he give her? She looked him up and down as he strained to change her. She made a realization, that the only way for her to change was to do something she wasn&rsquo;t really comfortable with. She steeled herself, and bent down.</p>
<p>Josh was pouring all of his will into changing Jenna, picturing her legs merging and reforming into a bright pink tail. He felt a gentle hand begin to paw and stoke up and down the front of his tail. Arousal built within him, and he felt himself becoming erect. Pain shot through his upper tail as he tried to figure out how to release his member. Finally, after trying seemingly every muscle, he could think of, his vent opened and his penis shot forth. Jenna steeled her resolve and took it into her mouth. Under the circumstances, Josh didn&rsquo;t last long, he felt his ejaculate well up from his relocated testicles through his tail and erupt into Jenna&rsquo;s mouth. She tried not to think about what she was swallowing and concentrated on the pink tail that she so desperately wanted to have. With each pulse from Josh, she felt the power within her build to new heights.</p>
<p>After the final pulse from Josh, she felt the change reach critical mass and pull her arms straight out away from her body and her head pulled away from Josh. She drifted to the center of the grotto as her final transition finally began. Through the rest of the day and night, her legs merged and lengthened, new organs grew within her while she felt the urge to push, signifying the reconfiguring of her pelvis and the relocation of her reproductive organs. What remained of her feet formed into the base of her tail and her flukes. As night turned back into day, her new tail&rsquo;s scales shifted from the color of her tanned skin to a dusky pink, with white fringes forming on her mid tail and pelvic fins, along with her dorsal fringe as it ran halfway up her back. Finally, pink highlights made their way all throughout her blonde hair, giving a subtle pink tint depending on the angle of the light.</p>
<p>Josh watched in awe as his love changed before his eyes. The compulsion to hum didn&rsquo;t leave him until she completed her transformation and her tail curled above her head. Jenna straightened out upon her release and looked down over herself. She smiled as she curled her flukes in front of her face and touched them. He swam up to her: &ldquo;You are..,&rdquo; he trailed off. He wanted to say that she was the most beautiful thing he&rsquo;d ever seen, but that didn&rsquo;t seem adequate to the task. Her figure had only slightly changed: her breasts were a bit larger, up to an E-cup, her waist ever so slightly cinched in, but her face was the same, save the sparkling light blue jewels that her eyes had become.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh wow!&rdquo; she responded, reveling in the feelings coming from her new form. Her tail was long and the muscles felt incredibly powerful, yet she had somehow never felt more feminine and graceful.</p>
<p>Josh put his arms around her waist and looked into her eyes. The two newest mers in the world began to feel the post-change passion build, the undeniable want that only one thing could satisfy. Josh and Jenna kissed passionately, their lips parting and tongues entwining. Josh worked the muscle that opened his vent as he felt his mate shudder in his arms. Jenna wrapped her tail around Josh&rsquo;s and squeezed in her instinctive need to be one with him. she felt herself open up for him, and he guided his member to her vent, ever so slowly pushing into her. He felt a barrier as he pushed into her and stopped. Their eyes met and he gave her a questioning look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Told you it would be special,&rdquo; she cooed at him.</p>
<p>He brought his hand up and gently stroked her face, marveling at this amazing woman. Their desire built again and he ever so slowly pushed further into her. She shuddered when he took her virginity, and the breaking of that literal barrier loosed the passions that had been building and they broke out in a wave. They made love earnestly, unleashing all the pent up passions of the month since they&rsquo;d landed on the island. The sun was high in the sky before they finally finished. Quietly they held each other as they recovered, with Josh still firmly inside of Jenna, the two of them basking in their connection that they had felt growing stronger with every orgasm.</p>
<p>Their reverie was broken by the sound of their stomachs grumbling in protest. A day without food along with the rigors of changing had emptied their reserves. Smiling at each other, they unwrapped their tails, Jenna moaning as Josh slowly withdrew from her. The new mates moved out of the grotto to explore their new forms and find lunch.</p>
<p>Manami sat on the beach, looking over the water, fretting terribly over the fate of Josh and Jenna. How long did it take to change into a mermaid? Did they have to spin a cocoon or something? They&rsquo;d been gone for two days now, and Manami was really worried. She was also very hungry. Josh and Jenna had always volunteered to go out and collect sea food from the lagoon, while Sarah and Manami stayed away from the water. This restricted their diet to coconuts, which got old VERY quickly. It also wasn&rsquo;t very nutritious, and so Manami held her rumbling stomach and looked at the water.</p>
<p>Sarah emerged from the raft, seeing Manami&rsquo;s long stare at the lagoon. She was worried sick about Josh and Jenna as well. It wasn&rsquo;t a feeling she understood. Josh and Jenna had made their choices, and those choices didn&rsquo;t affect her. That was what she kept telling herself anyway. The longing she felt for them hadn&rsquo;t abated. She fought it every moment, determined to maintain her independence and get off this damn island. Her stomach growled, and she cursed her own stupidity in not taking the initiative and getting food from the lagoon before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Sarah said as she approached Manami.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; came the sad reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m sorry about the food situation,&rdquo; Sarah said, steeling her composure. &ldquo;I feel responsible for you and I haven&rsquo;t been picking up the slack since they left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Manami replied. &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;ve been going through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but that&rsquo;s no excuse,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go out and get food in the lagoon. I know what Josh and Jenna were bringing back. Why don&rsquo;t you go get us some more water, and I&rsquo;ll get food, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Manami picked herself up and dusted the sand off of herself. Before she walked away, she turned back to Sarah. &ldquo;Do you think they did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Sarah replied, &ldquo;We may never find out if they decide to leave us. We just need to concentrate on us. We need food and water, we can worry about them later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami nodded sadly and headed off towards the spring with the canteen.</p>
<p>Sarah sighed and picked up the collection bag Josh and Jenna had used for their last meal. She had no idea where to go to get the grasses and shellfish Josh and Jenna had been getting, but she had no choice but to go looking. She grabbed the collection bag and headed off into the lagoon.</p>
<p>Josh and Jenna were out in the eastern edge of the lagoon testing their abilities. Jenna streaked through the water, not as quickly as Josh, but she was no slouch. With a smile on her face and belly full of food, she flipped her tail, rolled and twisted, throughly enjoying her new form. He mer senses showed her exactly where her mate was, even when he tried to hide in the sea grass meadow below to surprise her. Now they circled and swooped together, each time closer and closer. On one pass his pelvic fin stroked her side, then her fluke fringes trailed along his abs and chest. He would brush her breast ever so softly on a pass, then she would caress close to his vent with her pelvic fin. Over and over, slowly building their passions as they explored their bodies and improved their mastery of the power they now possessed. As their desire grew again, their electroluminescence kicked in, if one had been overhead in an aircraft, they would have seen a pink and blue light weaving around over the green sea grass field, crossing at different parts of the plain.</p>
<p>Josh opened his vent, and on their next close pass, he lined himself up and entered Jenna. She gasped, hugging her arms and wrapping her tail around her mate. Josh kissed her deeply as he thrust and let their momentum stop, rolling suspended in the water as they once again expressed their love. Their first orgasm exploded simultaneously, Josh growled his passion as Jenna called his name. Their rhythm hardly abated as they slowly sank down to the grass bed below. Over and over again they reached their climax as they rolled around on their giant undersea bed.</p>
<p>Sarah was swimming her way through the lagoon. Between hauling the collection bag and looking down for food. When she did find food, it was a chore to stay down long enough to actually get a useful amount. No wonder they&rsquo;d gone hungry so often before Josh and Jenna&rsquo;s gills had started coming in and they&rsquo;d gotten the hang of fishing. She was determined not to give up, she&rsquo;d prove that she didn&rsquo;t need to be a mermaid to take care of Manami and herself. She&rsquo;d force the mers to get them off this damn atoll and send her home. She was so determined and focused on her task, that she didn&rsquo;t realize that she was being hunted.</p>
<p>Josh and Jenna laid together in the grass, basking the dappled sunlight. They were only about eight feet down, so the water was warm and the light bright. They laid together, tails still wrapped, on their sides on a particularly thick bed of grass, foreheads pressed together enjoying their closeness and relaxing after their activities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what everyone was so excited about,&rdquo; Jenna finally said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has sex like that,&rdquo; Josh replied. &ldquo;That was amazing, like&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trashy romance novel sex!&rdquo; Jenna said with a playful raise of her eyebrows.</p>
<p>Josh laughed at that. &ldquo;If you say so dearest,&rdquo; he said before leaning in and softly kissing her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you think we should wait until we go back to them?&rdquo; Jenna asked when they parted. &ldquo;They must be getting hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Josh said, resigned to the fact that they would have to take substantial food supplies back to Sarah and Manami.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if.,&rdquo; she trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did we make a baby?&rdquo; Jenna finally asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would think so,&rdquo; Josh said with a sly grin. &ldquo;I mean, how could we have not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if the mers are having sex all the time, does that mean they have tons of kids?&rdquo; Jenna asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to hold off until we see them again?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, even if I get pregnant, I want a child with you anyway. If I&rsquo;m not pregnant already, there must be something stopping it,&rdquo; Jenna figured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josh?&rdquo; she asked when she saw the look on his face.</p>
<p>Josh had stiffened up, and looked like he was trying to concentrate on something with his mer senses. There was something big in the lagoon. Not a dolphin, it was too big. He also felt something else in the water, something familiar&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big shark in the lagoon!&rdquo; He said hurriedly as he pulled himself away from Jenna and sped towards where he felt the shark was. Adrenaline poured through his body as he sped through the water, ready for a fight.</p>
<p>Sarah had given up on the shellfish and was going for small fish that she could bag in the net. As she whipped around, going for a small school of fish, she saw what had been following her, and her blood ran cold. She was being stalked by a tiger shark.</p>
<p>Tigers didn&rsquo;t normally come into the lagoon, and the small reef sharks would usually leave people alone, but tigers were big, aggressive, curious ocean-going fish that would experimentally bite almost anything. Even one bite from what appeared to be an eight or nine foot long shark would likely cause her to bleed out, and even if it decided she didn&rsquo;t taste good, she&rsquo;d be too weak to swim back to their island. The shark approached closer and closer, and Sarah began splashing at it and yelling, trying to keep it away as it came close to the surface and closed in on what appeared to be a soft, slow-moving morsel. Easy pickings for a predator of the shark&rsquo;s caliber.</p>
<p>Sarah saw it coming and was trying to think of something else to do. Before she could kick or punch at it, a blue streak came up from below, smashing into the shark and sending it flying into the air with a huge eruption of water. Sarah covered her face until the lagoon settled, and she saw Josh, poised with his hands clenched into fists, watching the shark, now upside-down in the water several feet away. She saw that he was high in the water, his skin transitioning into blue scales at his waist, with two fins to either side. Sarah floated, mouth agape at the sight of Josh&rsquo;s new form.</p>
<p>Sure that the shark was dead, Josh turned to Sarah, put his hands on his hips in a heroic pose and smiled a cocky smile. &ldquo;Ta da!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Sarah was still looking for words, when she felt something lifting her in the water. It was Jenna, she&rsquo;d swum after Josh and had seen him hit the shark in the left gill with his right shoulder at full speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Jenna asked. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t get you at all did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No..,&rdquo; Sarah answered after a moment, then trailed off as she saw the pink highlights in Jenna&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;all like it?&rdquo; she asked, holding out a lock to show it off.</p>
<p>Sarah didn&rsquo;t have an answer, she just fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that was a bit much for her,&rdquo; Jenna said as she cradled Sarah, keeping her head above water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you get her back to the beach?&rdquo; Josh asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll clean this shark and we can butcher it on the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t bring that thing onto the beach, you&rsquo;ll put Manami in a coma!&rdquo; Jenna retorted. &ldquo;Just get it out of the lagoon, and find some of our regular shellfish and grasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Josh said, feeling a little stupid about it. &ldquo;See you in a few hun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenna moved Sarah around and held her in the the standard rescue swimming position, then slowly made her way back to shore.</p>
<p>Josh grabbed the shark&rsquo;s tail just above the fin in one hand and the collection bag in the other and swam hard, pulling the bleeding body to a gap between islands, out beyond the surf, and let it go into the open ocean. Hopefully other predators would be drawn to it rather than the atoll. It seemed like a waste of good meat, but nothing would truly go to waste in the ocean. Something would eat that shark, even if it wasn&rsquo;t them. He turned back towards the lagoon and set about collecting food for the four of them.</p>
<p>Manami was worried sick about Sarah. The more time that went by, the more and more worried she felt. She was pacing back and forth, seriously considering going in after her. She saw what could be a person swimming towards her on the surface. &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; she called out. As the shape drew closer, she could see that the swimmer was blonde. It was Jenna! &ldquo;Jenna!&rdquo; she yelled out into the lagoon. Jenna turned her head, and Manami saw what she thought were flashes of pink in Jenna&rsquo;s hair. She also saw Sarah&rsquo;s brown hair against Jenna&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>Jenna finally drew up close to the shore, &ldquo;Manami, can you help me get her under the lean-to?&rdquo; Manami wondered for a moment why Jenna wasn&rsquo;t standing up, then the small waves in the lagoon pulled back, and Manami saw Jenna&rsquo;s pink tail. She stopped in her tracks. Jenna looked back from holding Sarah&rsquo;s head out of the water and saw Manami staring at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweetie, I know this is hard, but I haven&rsquo;t figured out how to walk like the other mers did, so, I need you to help move Sarah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami saw that Sarah was asleep, maybe hurt. She&rsquo;d been so strong for Manami, how could Manami fail her? She slowly took steps forward, and felt the panic start to build. It was the hardest thing Manami had ever done, but ever so slowly she walked to the water and pulled Sarah from Jenna&rsquo;s grasp, dragging her a few feet up the beach to keep her head out of the water. Jenna rolled onto her front, then found that she was able to bend back at the waist, putting her torso perpendicular to her tail. so she was sitting up, but would her fins and flukes really hold up her weight?</p>
<p>Only one way to find out: she concentrated on pulling her new pelvic and mid-tail fins beneath her and positioning them to support her tail. That got her most of the way up, and once she felt stable, she pulled her fluke beneath her to get the very end of her tail off the sand. Now that she was up, she started working out that slithering gait the mers had, eventually she got it and was able to &ldquo;salamander&rdquo; just like the she&rsquo;d seen Rose and her sisters do. She then helped Manami pull Sarah to the lean-to so that she was out of the sun, and they placed Sarah&rsquo;s head in Jenna&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to her?&rdquo; Manami asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a big shark after her, but Josh killed it!&rdquo; she said quickly in response to Manami&rsquo;s gasp. &ldquo;He was awesome, he killed it with one shoulder to the gill at full speed,&rdquo; she said, proud of her mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out in the lagoon, getting food,&rdquo; Jenna replied.</p>
<p>It became quiet around the lean-to, Manami slowly worked up the courage to make some sort of contact with Jenna. This familiar face was now this creature&hellip; the last mermaids she&rsquo;d seen had caused panic attacks, but, for some reason, maybe it was time, maybe familiarity, or just Jenna&rsquo;s friendly spirit, but the panic wasn&rsquo;t coming so quickly anymore.</p>
<p>Manami slowly moved her eyes from Jenna&rsquo;s smiling face, down her chest and belly, to her waist. She steeled herself and moved her eyes down to where her skin transitioned to her pink scales. Maybe, maybe it was just that her tail was a soft, friendly pink. She moved past Sarah&rsquo;s calm face, down past the two sets of fins, down her long tail to the area just above the base of Jenna&rsquo;s flukes. Slowly, she finally reached her hand out and felt the incredibly smooth surface of Jenna&rsquo;s tail. It wasn&rsquo;t harsh at all like sharkskin could be.</p>
<p>Jenna watched her friend carefully, not moving so as not to startle her. She marveled at how her mer senses picked told her about Manami&rsquo;s emotional state, even her heart rate. She let Manami take her time, getting her used to touching a mermaid&rsquo;s tail without it calling up the horrible memories of her sister. Finally, she spoke: &ldquo;Did it hurt, to change?&rdquo; she asked, looking up into Jenna&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little, and not for very long. My leg bones changing was the worst part. Mostly it was just this feeling of something powerful running through me, pushing one place and pulling another. then at the end it just whooshed out of me and I was done!&rdquo; she finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you and Josh&hellip;&rdquo; Manami trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah. Lots of times&rdquo; she said with an impish grin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re bonded now, mates, like husband and wife, but stronger. I can feel his love for me, it&rsquo;s just wonderful,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Being a mermaid is so much fun! We can swim really fast, and feel all the life in the ocean around us with new senses. I could swim the lagoon with my eyes closed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami took that in and quietly processed it for a moment. Finally she spoke: &ldquo;Miki would have loved to be a mermaid,&rdquo; Manami finally said. &ldquo;She was like you. Happy all the time..,&rdquo; she trailed off as she looked sadly at Jenna&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a sister before,&rdquo; Jenna said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an only child. It would be nice to have a sister mermaid,&rdquo; she let that hang in the air, and saw Manami&rsquo;s eyes move back up her body towards her breasts. To where the milk that could push Manami towards becoming her sister mermaid, to joining her family. For just a moment, Jenna allowed herself to believe that Manami would take milk from her right then and there. Then Manami&rsquo;s eyes moved to Sarah. The friend that had been like a mother to her, and she remembered her real mother back home in Kobe. How could she deprive her and her father of their only remaining daughter by giving up her legs and choosing a life in the sea? It became very quiet. Jenna&rsquo;s spell broken, the mermaid and her friend waited for the sleeping woman on Jenna&rsquo;s lap to awaken.</p>
<p>It seemed that Sarah Mendelson had consistently fallen unconscious at the worst possible times. The plane crash, the raft, now when Josh had suddenly appeared to save her from another horrible death, she&rsquo;d fainted. Fainted like a little girl. That was just embarrassing. Now she opened her eyes and looked up into two very large breasts, with Jenna&rsquo;s face beyond. She gasped and sat up suddenly, her eyes wide as she checked for the taste of milk in her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright. I didn&rsquo;t pour milk down your throat while you were sleeping,&rdquo; Jenna said. Sarah looked Jenna up and down, noting the pink tinted blonde hair that fell in soft curls to the sand and the jewellike eyes, she skipped the chest, but went down to her waist, down to the pink scales and fins, down to her flukes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he do to you?&rdquo; she finally asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did nothing to me, well, he helped me change, but this was my choice,&rdquo; Jenna said, patting her tail. &ldquo;LIke I was telling Manami, this is wonderful, the best feeling I&rsquo;ve ever had, why won&rsquo;t you believe me?&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay Sarah. I saw the whole time. Jenna just held your head out of the sand,&rdquo; Manami comforted her.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath and calming herself, Sarah tried looking at the situation logically. Josh and Jenna were mermaids. Fine, good for them, they can do musical numbers with crabs all day long if they want. She and Manami were still human, and now, more than ever, needed to get off of this atoll.</p>
<p>Josh had finished gathering food for lunch and powered his way back to the beach. As the water got more shallow, he burst up short of the water line, his long body sticking in the sand much the same way Jenna&rsquo;s had. He bent back at the waist and found that he could raise himself vertically , but he was still stuck in the sand. He looked around and saw Jenna with Manami and Sarah under the lean-to. &ldquo;How did you get up there?&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>Jenna smiled at her stuck merman. Her heart rose upon seeing him again. &ldquo;Hang on, I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; she shifted her tail beneath herself and to the amazement of Sarah, she easily salamandered down to the water&rsquo;s edge and exchanged a quick kiss with Josh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty easy honey. Just put your fins beneath you and push up, they&rsquo;ll hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh gave her a somewhat sceptical look, but this woman hadn&rsquo;t led him astray yet. He pulled both pelvic fins beneath him (he didn&rsquo;t know that he&rsquo;d ever get used to the feeling of four extra limbs down his front), then got his mid-tail fins beneath. Finally, his meter and a half long flukes pushed down and his heavy tail rose off of the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, just sort of push-pull with each side of your tail, yeah, like that,&rdquo; Jenna watched as her student slowly waddled his way up the beach, his gait becoming smoother as he went. He turned and headed back to her. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve got it baby!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you dearest,&rdquo; he said as he salamandered up to her and embraced her with a kiss. He turned and looked back at the two human women still under the lean-to watching them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get them their food. They must be pretty hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh grabbed the collection bag in one hand and Jenna&rsquo;s hand in another and they headed up to Sarah and Manami together. There was a moment of tension between them. Sarah looked like she might be getting ready to bolt at the first sign of and sudden moves from Josh. Manami just stared, still trying to reconcile her feelings between fear of sea creatures and the beautiful sights before her. People that she knew to be friendly were pulling her towards this momentous change. Yanked hard from both directions, her mind was a storm. She decided to concentrate on something simple: her hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Josh, Did you get lunch?&rdquo; she asked, nodding at the bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he replied, his deep blue eyes seemingly looking right into her. &ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; he pulled the collection bag open and dumped their now-familiar assortment of shellfish and grasses. He turned to Sarah, still concerned with how fast her heart was racing. &ldquo;Are you alright Sarah? I didn&rsquo;t mean to scare you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, and I didn&rsquo;t think you were trying to scare me. Thank you for saving me though, and for bringing food,&rdquo; she tried to sound businesslike, but she was just barely holding back feelings toward Josh that were stronger than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome. I couldn&rsquo;t do anything else,&rdquo; he looked her dead in the eye. &ldquo;My pod mate was in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your-&rdquo; she started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as my instincts are concerned you are,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;When I was swimming at that shark, the only thought going through my mind was that my mate was in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been Jenna,&rdquo; Sarah replied quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Josh shook his head. &ldquo;I knew Jenna was safe. I&rsquo;ll bet she could have swum circles around that shark, and I left Jenna to come after you. What I felt was my bonding to you. You haven&rsquo;t felt anything yourself?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said weakly. It was a horrible lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true and you know it,&rdquo; Jenna challenged. &ldquo;We can feel your emotions and your body&rsquo;s reactions through our mer senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The siren cells are affecting me, I admit it,&rdquo; she sighed and turned away. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to surrender and give up everything just because I&rsquo;m horny. The effects of these things will wear off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenna rolled her eyes. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t &lsquo;wear off&rsquo;! They stay in your body and get stronger. You heard Rose when she was here: more feeding just speeds up the change, it is unstoppable, and the siren cells will never totally leave your body. I don&rsquo;t think we could have ever been the same people once those cells entered our bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah had run out of energy to argue, she just turned back and looked at Josh. &ldquo;Thank you for saving me, but I still don&rsquo;t want to be your mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. I get it, but I hope you change your mind,&rdquo; Josh replied with a nod. &ldquo;Manami,&rdquo; he turned to the smaller woman. &ldquo;Will you join us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami looked between Josh and Jenna, seriously considering the offer, she looked like she might be leaning towards a tail, but when she got to Sarah, her loyalty to the older woman finally caused her to silently shake her head.</p>
<p>Josh sighed, and turned to his mermaid mate &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go for a swim, check to see if there are any other big nasties in the lagoon and maybe have some fun. Would you like to join me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenna nodded. &ldquo;Sure sweetie pie, I&rsquo;ll meet you in a minute, we need some girl time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh smiled at her pet name for him. &ldquo;Okay snugglepot, see you in a bit!&rdquo; He turned and salamandered down to the water, disappearing into the lagoon.</p>
<p>Jenna turned to Sarah. &ldquo;You know, he&rsquo;s a good man.Y&rsquo;all put work ahead of love for your whole life, and here, now, when love is literally right in front of your face, you pull back,&rdquo; she left before Sarah could respond.</p>
<p>Manami was lost in thought. Seeing Jenna and Josh as mers had made an enormous impact on her. They seemed so happy. Why shouldn&rsquo;t she be happy like that too? Jenna&rsquo;s words to Sarah weren&rsquo;t lost on her either. As the dutiful, responsible daughter, she&rsquo;d done her best to keep Miki out of trouble, until troubles so big not even the bonds between sisters could protect her. Maybe it was time for a new family. Manami settled down to think on it as she silently dug into the lunch Josh had provided.</p>
<p>Jenna swam after Josh, he was easy to find, his signal like a bright spotlight among candles to her mer senses. He was cruising around the south edge of the lagoon, sweeping the gaps in the atoll and the surrounding waters for any large predators. She sped up, smiling at the incredible feeling of water rushing over her body. What would her friend Karen say now, or her high school friend Aylah? That would be fun, pulling up on the beach in Pass Christian in front of all her old high school friends (and some &ldquo;enemies&rdquo;, this was high school after all), showing off her merman in front of all the boys who&rsquo;d dumped her in for &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; cheerleaders. She entertained the thought for a minute, but then realized that rubbing noses in it would be counter-productive and impractical. She got a visual on Josh, cruising along about eight feet down. She decided to buzz by him at high speed and kicked hard.</p>
<p>Josh sensed Jenna&rsquo;s approach from a far distance, he even noticed when she accelerated in an attempt to take him by surprise. He decided, just this once, he told himself, to let her do it this time. He kept a steady speed and watched as she streaked past him at high speed, feeling the buffeting from her wake. He could watch her beautiful body swim all day. She circled around and slowed as she pulled up next to him and gave him a long kiss that he returned in kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I get ya?&rdquo; she asked excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, you got me,&rdquo; he said sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a terrible liar you are,&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I think. I can&rsquo;t help it that I can detect you wherever you are in the water!&rdquo; he came back. They held hands as they swum, a couple in love out for a stroll. Josh started thinking about their situation and Jenna saw his serious mein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny for your thoughts,&rdquo; she queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to say something, and I don&rsquo;t know that you&rsquo;ll like it,&rdquo; Josh said cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you want to go off with that female dolphin that helped tear your shirt off!&rdquo; Jenna said with mock surprise. &ldquo;I knew she was a tramp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh laughed. &ldquo;No, though it does involve a woman, two, to be exact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just before we started changing, the day I discovered my gills, I decided on my walk that you were the only mermaid I&rsquo;d ever need; if Sarah and Manami didn&rsquo;t want this, then fine, you were just perfect,&rdquo; Josh gathered himself. &ldquo;I was deathly afraid when I was going after that shark. All of a sudden, I realized that Sarah is important to me. I mean,she&rsquo;s a pain in the ass, she&rsquo;s constantly hostile, treats me like I&rsquo;m going to rape her at any moment, all I wanted to do was throw her in the raft and tow her to Australia myself once I got my tail, and yet I care about her deeply. I want to be her merman,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We bonded. We all bonded after that first drink of milk. It&rsquo;s the only answer I can think of,&rdquo; his mate replied. &ldquo;What about Manami?&rdquo; she asked tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manami. I just want to wrap my arms around her, look her right in those big brown eyes, tell her that everything will be alright, and keep her safe from the world. I have two brothers, and I can&rsquo;t imagine losing one of them like that,&rdquo; he pulled up. &ldquo;I think we need to be a complete pod,&rdquo; he finally declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean. I think we&rsquo;ll be better off with more mermaids in the pod. I love you, but I can feel myself being pulled to Manami and Sarah too,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;That and, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m much of a leader, we need a good decision maker to lead the pod. Sarah is perfect for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, though I will say that you did a great job getting us this far. I wouldn&rsquo;t be swimming here without you. You are an amazing woman, and an even more amazing mermaid,&rdquo; Josh said.</p>
<p>Jenna kissed him again. He would never get tired of the feeling of those perfect lips on his. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think Manami is really close to joining us, and Sarah will come soon after. Let&rsquo;s stay out here until dinner time, then we&rsquo;ll head back. I&rsquo;ve got an idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenna sped off again, looking to play and get away from all the sturm und drang of their conversation. Josh smiled and chased after her. They powered through the canyons and tunnels at the bottom of the lagoon, then pulled straight up together and burst from the water into the warm afternoon sun. At the top of their jump, their eyes met. Two people perfectly in love, perfectly at peace with themselves.</p>
<p>Sarah and Manami ate quietly, neither wanting to talk about the storm of emotions inside them. They cleaned up their food silently as well, tidying up their campsite after the excitement of the day. They heard a splash out in the lagoon, but neither was able to see anything. As the afternoon wore on towards the evening and the sun hung low in the sky, Josh and Jenna appeared with a freshly killed and cleaned grouper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a fire going,&rdquo; Sarah said matter of factly as she trudged off to get wood while Manami brought out a thermal survival blanket for the fish once it was cooked, and Jenna and Josh rigged up a skewer and two large sticks to turn the fish over the fire so that it would cook evenly. As the fish cooked, Jenna started up a conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we should go looking for the mers island?&rdquo; She asked aloud to the group. &ldquo;Josh and and I can cover tons of ocean, we might get lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more likely that you&rsquo;ll get lost,&rdquo; Sarah replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, maybe not,&rdquo; Josh said, following Jenna&rsquo;s lead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be good for you Sarah, the faster we find them, the faster you go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah rolled her eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how fast you swim, you won&rsquo;t find their island if you swim for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a better idea?&rdquo; Jenna asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to wait, be patient. You&rsquo;re a mermaid, you have ready food and shelter, you stay put and wait for them to come get you,&rdquo; Sarah said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, thanks, good idea,&rdquo; Jenna said with a small smile.</p>
<p>The fish cooked quickly, and they polished off most of it even more quickly, wrapping what was left for tomorrow in the thermal blanket. They sat around the fire, Josh and Jenna snuggled together while Manami and Sarah sat opposite, Manami stealing glances at them, Sarah trying to look at anything but the mers. Finally she decided to head to bed. &ldquo;Well, good night. You coming Manami?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Manami said quietly and slinked back towards the raft with Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, whatever will we do with ourselves?&rdquo; Jenna said suggestively once they were alone. She rolled over on top of Josh, moaning as he ran his hands along her body, gripping her powerful muscles where her rump used to be. He could feel her arousal build and he released his vent, their electroluminescence beginning to dance along their tails, pink and blue light mingling with the light of the fire. Jenna gasped as he entered her, and she pulled her upper body up vertically, holding Josh&rsquo;s hands as they made love. They both moaned their ecstasy as they built toward orgasm.</p>
<p>Jenna&rsquo;s head fell back as she moaned, she looked to her left and opened her eyes and saw Manami staring wide-eyed from the raft. She couldn&rsquo;t see Sarah, but did feel some familiar, passionate feelings coming from within the raft. She smiled slightly, eyes lidded, firelight and the light of her and Josh&rsquo;s passions dancing in her unreal jewel-like eyes as she locked her stare with Manami&rsquo;s own. She thrust out her chest in offering, and beckoned with her left hand, her arm stretched out, fingers curling in turn one after the other, offering Manami a love that simply didn&rsquo;t exist in the human world.</p>
<p>Manami had never seen a more erotic display. These two souls shared themselves unconditionally, purely. Now they wanted her to join them. Her old life was over, her sister was gone, and she didn&rsquo;t know how to face her parents. It was time for a new type of reincarnation, one not imagined by Buddha himself. She found herself leaving the raft, as if in a dream, walking towards Jenna, eyes never parting between the mermaid and the young woman. When she reached them, she knelt down and gently cradled Jenna&rsquo;s large breast with her hands, the nipples standing attention, leaking a small amount of milk that would change her. This was her last chance to back out, but that thought was washed away as she took the nipple into her mouth and sucked, feeling the milk flow into her mouth and down her gullet. The sucking triggered Jenna&rsquo;s orgasm, she screamed her pleasure, milk erupting from her other nipple splattering on her merman as she clenched down on Josh, whose own orgasm fired off into Jenna. Jenna felt her orgasm rise yet again as she was thoroughly pleasured by her mate and suckled by Manami, who didn&rsquo;t stop until she&rsquo;d finally drained Jenna&rsquo;s breast. Jenna didn&rsquo;t dismount from Josh as Manami switched around and took what little milk remained in Jenna&rsquo;s right breast after the double climaxes.</p>
<p>The mers' internal light show dimmed as their passions ebbed, and the unattended fire began to flicker down as well. Josh and Jenna settled under the lean-to, Jenna pillowing her head on Josh&rsquo;s shoulder. Josh and Jenna turned to Manami and smiled in invitation. The young Japanese woman leaned forward and kissed Jenna quickly on the lips, then kissed Josh as well. She held the kiss for a few seconds and then, to Josh&rsquo;s surprise, opened her mouth and pushed her tongue into Josh&rsquo;s mouth. Josh smiled as she pulled back, and he turned and kissed Jenna goodnight as well. Manami pillowed her head against Josh&rsquo;s free shoulder and cuddled as she&rsquo;d seen Jenna do for months. The three of them dozed off quickly as the fire died.</p>
<p>Off in the raft, a lone figure lay with her back to the opening. Even though there hadn&rsquo;t been any more vocalization than the sounds of passionate lovemaking, she&rsquo;d felt Manami leave the raft, and try though she might, the sounds and smells of lovemaking had coupled with her own siren-cell caused feelings to bring her own passions to the fore. Sarah quietly cried herself to sleep, her hand down the front of her underwear as she tried desperately to relieve the passions she felt.</p>
<p>In the early morning hours, with only the barest hint of dawn on the horizon, Josh found himself waking up. He kept his eyes closed for just a moment, feeling not only the sensations his tail and mer senses were feeding him, but just the sensations of now two women sleeping against him. Jenna&rsquo;s tail and Manami&rsquo;s legs and feet had wrapped themselves around his tail in the night. All in all, there were far worse places to be stuck. His eyes opened and he took in the night sky. It was the same sky, more or less, that he&rsquo;d seen three months ago when Jenna had first asked to sleep with him. The circumstances had changed dramatically though. He and Jenna weren&rsquo;t even the same species anymore, and a woman who he didn&rsquo;t think would ever willingly be with him was curled up against his left side.</p>
<p>He turned left and studied Manami&rsquo;s face. He&rsquo;d been so focused on Jenna and so worried about further traumatizing her that he&rsquo;d barely spoken to her in their time on the island. He did notice that her hair seemed a bit thicker and shinier, and her face wasn&rsquo;t so twisted with pain and stress. Perhaps the bonding was affecting her already? She stirred slowly and opened her eyes, meeting his. Her eyes were beautiful, big and brown, and now without the awful sadness that had consumed her since the crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she replied with a peck on the lips. She looked across his chest at the still-sleeping mermaid. &ldquo;How did you sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just fine,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;How could I not with two beautiful women like you and Jenna with me. This is pretty much the male fantasy right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty fantastical yourself,&rdquo; Jenna said. She&rsquo;d been playing possum for the last few minutes, letting Josh and Manami be together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Josh and Manami said almost simultaneously. Josh and Jenna shared a quick kiss, then Jenna leaned in for a kiss from Manami, who only hesitated for a second before returning the greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am really, I guess, dry, so I&rsquo;m gonna take a quick dip. Coming?&rdquo; she asked Josh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be along in a minute. I need a dip too but I can wait a minute,&rdquo; he said. Jenna smiled and headed off into the water. Josh and Manami sat up and stretched, she watched his fins and flukes flex and fan. It was strange to see a mer tail behave in such an organic way. Even the best costumes were static, the flukes were always cloth, foam rubber, or a monofin covered in fabric, so seeing a live tail, bending and flexing in front of her was novel, to say the least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, I know Jenna is spectacular, but what made you decide that it was time to join us?&rdquo; Josh asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had thought about it for a while now,&rdquo; Manami admitted. &ldquo;But when I saw you and Jenna there, so in love, I wanted to be part of that. Jenna also told me about wanting a sister mermaid. Also, I thought that..,&rdquo; she choked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? I promise that whatever it is, you can tell me,&rdquo; Josh reassured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in reincarnation, that our souls pass between lives, with karma affecting what we go to next,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I was thinking that if I was a mermaid, and I had a baby with you, that Miki would be reincarnated as a mermaid, in our daughter. You probably don&rsquo;t believe that at all. I wasn&rsquo;t even sure you liked me,&rdquo; she said dejectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First off, I think that would be wonderful if we had a child. Jenna wants a family too, so they&rsquo;d be siblings. Maybe immediately isn&rsquo;t a good idea, maybe we should wait until we get to the mer&rsquo;s island, but yes, I would love to be a father,&rdquo; he took a breath. &ldquo;Secondly, I&rsquo;m sorry if you got the idea that I didn&rsquo;t like you. I thought that with all of the grieving you were going through, the last thing you would want would be a guy hanging all over you. I think that you are beautiful, and I can&rsquo;t wait to get to know you better and to spend my life being a good man for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami smiled an electric smile, her beautiful brown eyes lighting up with the love she felt towards this man. She wiped a tear from her eye, and Josh reached out and hugged her. Jenna emerged from the water, refreshed after her morning dip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;d I miss?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josh and I are going to have a baby!&rdquo; Manami said excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great! But you need to be a mermaid first,&rdquo; Jenna got herself situated in the sand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for your morning feeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we forgetting something?&rdquo; Josh asked. The two women looked at him with puzzled faces. He responded by tapping the silver headband he wore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Manami said and ran to the two remaining tiaras. Her&rsquo;s was easily picked out by the Wheel of Karma additions Rose had made at the temples. Manami picked up the beautiful silver headpiece and carried it back to Josh and Jenna. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, handing it to Josh. &ldquo;Put it on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t my choice. You made the choice to join us, you should put that on yourself,&rdquo; Josh said. Manami smiled at him, lifted her tiara and placed it on her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a real princess of the sea,&rdquo; Jenna replied with a smile. &ldquo;Now come on,&rdquo; she said and patted her scaly lap.</p>
<p>Manami laid her head down, still smiling as Jenna moved her left nipple into her mouth. She began sucking, and felt the sweet milk flowing into her mouth and down her throat, continuing to change her. She looked up at Jenna&rsquo;s face, her eyes half-closed with the pleasure of feeding. It seemed that being a mermaid was all about being loved and feeling pleasure. That worked for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wet my gills now. You ladies have fun,&rdquo; Josh said with a rueful smile. He salamandered into the water and splashed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okie dokie, you do that,&rdquo; Jenna moaned after he&rsquo;d already gone.</p>
<p>Sarah woke as the first rays of sunshine broke through the raft&rsquo;s opening. She quickly put herself together, making sure the bra and underwear she&rsquo;d been wearing was in place and putting on the slip she&rsquo;d worn originally under her discarded business suit. When she got up and left the raft, she was greeted with the sight of Manami switching to feed from Jenna&rsquo;s other breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; she said with a tear in her eye. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; she said to Manami. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really doing this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami was still feeding from Jenna&rsquo;s breast, and didn&rsquo;t respond. Jenna was roused from her stupor with an annoyed look on her face. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s made her choice. You know, being stubborn can be a good thing, but y&rsquo;all just take it to a whole new level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Sarah said angrily. &ldquo;I hope you have all kinds of fun!&rdquo; she said with a strained, exasperated voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we will,&rdquo; Jenna retorted. She looked down at Manami. &ldquo;Wanna go for a swim when you&rsquo;re done?&rdquo; Manami nodded as she finished off the last of Jenna&rsquo;s milk.</p>
<p>Manami stood up and she and Jenna headed out into the lagoon to find Josh, leaving Sarah alone. She fixed herself a coconut breakfast and sat dejectedly in front of the raft. Alone, with no one to talk to. She huffed and thought about her options. It had been about a month, she reckoned, the mers should be back any day now. If she could keep it together for a little bit longer, she could force them to take her to Fiji. It seemed so simple, but could she hold out that long? She felt stretched thin, ready to snap. She kept trying to tell herself that she had a life to go back to, but what kind of life was it? Constant meetings, travel, stress, and all for what? Stock options and a gold watch in another twenty years if she wasn&rsquo;t just shown the door?</p>
<p>She stood up and went over to where the utility belt was hung on the end of the lean-to. Sarah rummaged around until she found the signal mirror. It wasn&rsquo;t very big, but when she looked into it, it showed her a ragged, run-down woman. Her makeup was long gone, and the constant fight against the need she felt from the siren cells had also taken a toll. Deep crows' feet ran from her eyes, which had dark circles beneath them. Her lips were thinner than she remembered, and her eyes themselves seemed lifeless. Age had dulled her skin. She just felt awful.</p>
<p>Was an empty apartment worth all this? She&rsquo;d always told herself that she didn&rsquo;t need anyone, her work would fulfill her, romance was for other people. Yeah, right. Money in the bank didn&rsquo;t keep her bed warm at night. Her 401k wouldn&rsquo;t take care of her when she was sick, and she was damn sure her secretary wasn&rsquo;t her gal pal that she could talk about her problems with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; she said to no one in particular, tossing the mirror to the ground. She turned and looked at the last tiara hanging in the bush. It gleamed in the dawn sunlight, promising so much, and all she had to do was stop fighting and let go.</p>
<p>Josh swam on his back along the surface, Manami lying across his chest as Jenna swam alongside. Manami hadn&rsquo;t felt this healthy in years. Her skin glowed and tingled with the changes going on inside her. Her hair had grown in the night, nearly reaching her hips. She felt tingling along her back too. &ldquo;You guys hungry?&rdquo; Jenna called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please!&rdquo; Manami called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; came the reply from Josh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll grab some food, you head for that beach,&rdquo; Jenna said as she pointed to a smaller island along the southern end of the atoll, then dove down into the deeper parts of the lagoon for food.</p>
<p>Josh lazily turned and headed for the island. He put his arms around Manami and she smiled at him and laid her head on his broad chest, letting him propel them along. Josh slowed once the water got too shallow to swim, and Manami reluctantly stood and let him salamander up the beach. The island wasn&rsquo;t really much more than a sandbar, with only a few shrubs and small palm trees for vegetation. They settled in to wait for Jenna. Quietly entwining and enjoying their newfound attraction to each other.</p>
<p>Jenna didn&rsquo;t take long to come back with breakfast, and they set upon it and quickly decimated it. Jenna thought for a moment, and decided to breach a subject she thought might speed things along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, I don&rsquo;t think I can feed you again for a little while, but I know where you can get more siren cells,&rdquo; she said carefully, eyes moving over to Josh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Manami answered, then she followed Jenna&rsquo;s eyes; &ldquo;Wait, don&rsquo;t tell me Josh gives milk,&rdquo; she said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenna..,&rdquo; Josh said with an uncertain tone. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re thinking what I think you&rsquo;re thinking, that really isn&rsquo;t necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be! I had to do it when I changed, it can only make things easier for her,&rdquo; Jenna protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did it once, at the very end. You only needed it to jumpstart the change,&rdquo; Josh responded. &ldquo;Manami, you don&rsquo;t have to do this, I will never ask or expect you to do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sweet Josh, but we need to get serious here,&rdquo; Jenna said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?!&rdquo; Manami asked, still not getting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only way you can get any meaningful amount of siren cells from me is in my&hellip; reproductive fluids,&rdquo; Josh tried to put it delicately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh..,&rdquo; Manami&rsquo;s eyes went wide. &ldquo;Jenna, why would you want me to do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to help you change faster, really. I just don&rsquo;t want you to have to wait as long as we did, so more siren cells could only help, right?&rdquo; she reasoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s doing fine. She&rsquo;s got real mermaid milk to go on, her hair is already longer. Manami, do you feel any different?&rdquo; Josh asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been kind of tingling since I fed, especially when we were in the water together, along my back mostly,&rdquo; Manami said as she tried to reach around to feel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemme see,&rdquo; Jenna said as she parted Manami&rsquo;s hair, then smiled as she saw two red streaks down her back. The beginnings of gills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow. Your gills are coming in already!&rdquo; Jenna squealed.</p>
<p>Josh moved around behind Manami. &ldquo;Great! Told you it wouldn&rsquo;t be long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, so you get to be right. Once,&rdquo; Jenna said with mock seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will happen to me, exactly, when I turn into a mermaid,&rdquo; Manami asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we started concentrating, trying to get the cells to change us, but we found that we needed another injection of siren cells from our partner to really get the process going,&rdquo; Jenna replied, smiling slightly. &ldquo;Like I said before, there&rsquo;s a huge amount of power that flows through you, you feel like you need to push down, and your legs fuse together..,&rdquo; Jenna trailed off as she remembered her change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, where does it happen? You just left the beach and showed up two days later,&rdquo; Manami asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found a protected area underwater,&rdquo; Josh explained. &ldquo;Stone walls surrounded with coral so sunlight could get in and we could keep anything else out. We&rsquo;ll show you when your gills come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to it!&rdquo; Manami exclaimed.</p>
<p>The three of them spent the rest of the day on the different beaches of the island, swimming the lagoon, showing Manami the seagrass plain, and stopping to feed her at lunch.</p>
<p>The sun hung low in the sky before they returned to Sarah. They came bearing food for the evening meal, and found a woman deep in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manami, you look, different,&rdquo; Sarah said with wide eyes upon seeing her friend. Manami&rsquo;s hair had grown to her waist, and her breasts had grown to the point where she&rsquo;d abandoned her bra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to be as big as her?&rdquo; Sarah said somewhat derisively, pointing to Jenna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she giggled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard you laugh like that,&rdquo; Sarah said quietly. Manami quietly smiled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for your evening feeding,&rdquo; Jenna said. Manami laid down and took Jenna&rsquo;s nipple into her mouth in their routine. They sat quietly together, and Josh salamandered over and quietly stroked Manami&rsquo;s hair as she fed. She smiled at his affection, her growing bond manifesting as feelings of love and trust in these two mers.</p>
<p>Sarah watched Jenna and Josh with Manami. It took all of her willpower to stop herself from joining them. Half of her wanted to get home, go back to work, run a sales meeting, close the next big deal. The other half wanted to drink mermaid milk, play with dolphins, swim in the deep depths and be held in the arms of a big, strong merman as he made love to her over and over again on the beach. Rather than fight her inner war in front of her three fellow survivors, she grabbed a couple of handfuls of food and practically ran back to the raft. The three mers barely noticed, as they fed Manami and settled in for their own dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can feel it,&rdquo; Manami said as they ate. &ldquo;Your milk moving around inside me. There&rsquo;s this pressure I can feel too. Is that you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; Josh said. &ldquo;The mers told us that we could affect how our pod mates look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to look like someone else?&rdquo; Manami asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you should be yourself,&rdquo; Josh said said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re changing fast,&rdquo; Jenna said. &ldquo;I bet you&rsquo;ll be ready to go to our grotto tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo; Manami gushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to bed, we may very well have a big day tomorrow,&rdquo; Josh suggested. The two women agreed and they laid under the lean-to, quickly falling asleep after their busy day.</p>
<p>Jenna woke up early the next morning, though not before the dawn had broken and the sun was fully over the eastern horizon. Excited, she lifted her head up and looked at the hand Manami had laying over Josh&rsquo;s chest. There was a miniscule amount of webbing on those hands. Jenna smiled to herself as she quietly disentangled herself from Josh and headed to the water. Today might very well be the big day.</p>
<p>When Manami woke, she felt like she was almost vibrating with the power of the siren cells. Her back felt a little funny, and as she looked down at herself, she saw that her breasts were probably a B-cup, and she was a bit curvier than she remembered. As she looked down at her legs, it was strange to think that she would not have them much longer. They would merge together and reform into something strange and beautiful. She&rsquo;d become ningyo. a mermaid. She couldn&rsquo;t wait, but what would her tail color be? She&rsquo;d liked the color purple growing up, as well as the look of silver jewelry on her fair skin. Maybe&hellip; she&rsquo;d have to see.</p>
<p>Josh had awoken by the time Jenna returned from her dip and food gathering. The three of them ate, then Manami settled down to feed again.</p>
<p>Jenna tried to figure things out as she fed Manami. &ldquo;This is your fifth, well, fourth and a half, if we&rsquo;re honest, feeding from me. I think we should test out your gills. You seem to be changing pretty quickly, but how well your gills work should tell us a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we could definitely start changing her today,&rdquo; Josh said. &ldquo;Look at her hands, the webbing was the last thing that appeared before we changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami smiled as she drank. It looked like she&rsquo;d be losing her legs soon. That prospect had scared her for the past month, but now, now she welcomed it and the new love and life that came with it. She finished feeding and stood up, turning back to her pod mates. &ldquo;I think I will be ready very soon,&rdquo; she said as she held her stomach, feeling the fresh siren cells move out inside her. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s swim, I&rsquo;d like you to show me where you changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh and Jenna exchanged knowing looks. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Josh said. &ldquo;When do you want to leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami took off her shirt. She&rsquo;d discarded her too-small bra the day before, then steeled herself to take off her underwear in front of Josh. She took a deep breath and pulled down her underwear, tossing them aside. &ldquo;Now, please,&rdquo; she asked politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright then,&rdquo; Jenna said with a smile. The three of them headed towards the water.</p>
<p>Sarah woke up later that morning and made her way out of the raft. She stopped short and gasped when she saw Manami&rsquo;s clothing lying near the lean-to. Even with her fast changes, she hadn&rsquo;t thought Manami would become a mermaid so quickly! She picked up Manami&rsquo;s shirt and sat in the sand. She cried for the friend who had seemingly lost herself in the siren song of these creatures. The war within her kindled anew. Was this loss, or the finding of something important and beautiful? She couldn&rsquo;t tell yet.</p>
<p>Josh, Jenna, and Manami swam out into the lagoon. This time though, they charted a course diagonally down to the grotto rather than along the surface. About fifteen feet down, they stopped. &ldquo;Do you need air?&rdquo; Josh asked Manami. Manami thought for a moment, then, feeling no pressure in her lungs, shook her head &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Jenna parted her hair in back and saw the two vertical strips of her gills, their fronds exchanging carbon dioxide for oxygen from the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got her full gills!&rdquo; Jenna exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go then,&rdquo; Josh said, taking Manami by the hand and continuing to swim down into the depths. Finally, they saw the grotto. Josh and Jenna hadn&rsquo;t been back since they&rsquo;d finished changing a few days before. They swam around to the entrance and guided Manami through before entering themselves. They saw Manami floating under the light filtered by the fan coral overhanging. She looked up and smiled in the light, then turned to the two mers before her. She looked them over, their beautiful graceful tails flashing with color in the sunlight. She wanted that power and beauty, she wanted their love. She looked down at her legs and imagined them merging together into a tail. A feeling of power, very much like the feeling she got from the milk began coursing through her. Josh and Jenna&rsquo;s eyes went wide when they felt it.</p>
<p>Josh had felt this before, it was the feeling they had gotten when they&rsquo;d been concentrating on their changes. Josh turned to Jenna with a look of concern. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s trying to do it herself!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s help!&rdquo; Jenna said. She swam up to Manami and offered what milk she had. Manami only drank briefly, Jenna not having much milk after having fed her after breakfast. Josh and Jenna took positions on opposite sides of Manami and started concentrating on her tail. The power built and built as it had during their changes, pushing agonizingly close to the tipping point, but wasn&rsquo;t quite there yet. Jenna realized this and took action. She moved from her position to Josh and began rubbing along his vent.</p>
<p>Josh felt his own arousal build. He looked down at Jenna with a furrowed brow. He didn&rsquo;t want this, it seemed so, unworthy, of the love that was part of being a mer. Jenna looked up and saw the look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must. We need more!&rdquo; She was really improvising now. Manami had started the change before either of them were ready and now they had to really hustle to sustain it. Josh trusted in Jenna&rsquo;s instinct and opened his vent, allowing his member to extend out into the water. Jenna grabbed Manami and pulled her down into position to take Josh&rsquo;s seed before going back to her position across from Josh.</p>
<p>Manami only hesitated for a moment before she took Josh into her mouth. She was fully committed now, and was going to see this through. She didn&rsquo;t have to wait long as Josh erupted into her quickly. Upon taking in the last pulse, she felt the change kick over, her arms pulled out from her sides and she floated back to the middle of the grotto. She felt the power of the change moving through her body, pushing and pulling. She felt her legs fuse together slowly, breaking painfully, then lengthen as the light around her dwindled when the sun sank in the sky. The sudden urge to push down Jenna had told her about came over her and she pushed. Her feet changed, slowly becoming her flukes as muscles wove up through her torso and tail. New fins grew in along her tail and at the elbows. Finally, in the near darkness of the moonlit lagoon, a metallic silver color began running up her tail. The bright, metallic color contrasted beautifully with her jet black hair. The fringes on her new fins, along with the full webbing of her hands, turned a deep purple in color. She felt the feeling of change push up and out, curling her tail behind her head before leaving her body completely, releasing her from the change.</p>
<p>Her tail uncurled from above her head. She was immediately bombarded by feelings from her new senses. She felt the life around her, including the bright signals of her two mates. The darkness would make no difference in her ability to navigate. Manami smiled brightly, it was done, she was a mermaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty cool, isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; Jenna said, hugging Manami and planting a kiss on her cheek. &ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; she groaned as the desire from the change began to manifest. The electroluminescence of the three mers kicked in as they became aroused, filling the dark water with pink, blue, and now silver light visible to any who might have been watching in the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amazing,&rdquo; Manami said through lidded eyes as she felt the same desire. Josh waited for them, his vent open, ready for his newest mermaid. Jenna and Manami swam to him. Manami stopped short. &ldquo;You should go first, you were a mermaid first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just changed, besides, you&rsquo;re the older sister,&rdquo; Jenna replied as she rested against Josh&rsquo;s side. Manami smiled at that and maneuvered herself in front of her new mate. Jenna guided her in by gently tugging on Manami&rsquo;s pelvic fin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you are alright with this?&rdquo; Manami asked as she was brought closer to Josh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; Jenna said incredulously. &ldquo;He is your mate too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manami wrapped her tail around Josh&rsquo;s as he settled his arms around her waist. He looked into her eyes as he guided himself in. She gasped as he entered her, and he gently kept going until their bellies met. Manami felt him inside of her, and it was unlike anything she&rsquo;d ever felt before. The only experience she&rsquo;d had with sex had been fumbling, cramped, and not enjoyable. This was different. Not just the physical differences, but the bonding between her and Josh, the genuine love she felt from him, made it truly special. For the first time in her life, she was making love, not just having sex.</p>
<p>Josh pulled out, and then moved back in, establishing a rhythm, holding hands in their love. Jenna smiled as she felt the bonds between her pod mates grow and solidify. She also noticed Josh&rsquo;s pelvic fins were vibrating in the water, his left one was very close to her vent, she felt the titillation of the water from the fin, and she decided to experiment. She pushed her vent closer to his fin and her eyes widened as she felt pleasure well up within her. It wasn&rsquo;t as good as what Manami was experiencing, but it sure beat just watching! She wrapped her tail around Josh and Manami&rsquo;s and pressed herself against him, moaning as her pleasure built ever higher.</p>
<p>Josh felt Jenna press herself against him, and turned his head and glanced at Jenna as she moaned on his fin. He didn&rsquo;t really have time to ponder that, he was&hellip; busy. He felt the first of many orgasms rip through himself and his podmates. The three mers had orgasms together several more times. Their bonds grew with their new mate. Finally, they calmed down enough for Jenna and Manami to switch positions. Manami pressed herself into Josh&rsquo;s fin as Jenna had done, and luxuriated in the feelings her mate continued to give her. After two and a half solid hours of lovemaking, the mers finally settled down to sleep. In one of his last conscious thoughts, Josh reflected on what Trevor had told him in that first full day on the island: So THAT&rsquo;S what he meant about all at once! He smiled slightly as he lightly kissed the tops of the two heads nestled against his chest, then fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>The three mers didn&rsquo;t wake until mid morning. Manami was the first to awake, and she found herself on Josh&rsquo;s right fin, wrapped up with Jenna and Josh. There&rsquo;s one more spot left. she thought to herself as she looked upon her two mates. She kept her head nestled against Josh&rsquo;s chest, mere inches from Jenna&rsquo;s face. She studied the beautiful, sleeping visage of her new mate and felt love and desire she&rsquo;d never felt for another woman within her. She thought on that for a moment, and decided that the feelings she&rsquo;d had since coming to the island had never led her astray, that she could feel their love and care of her pod mates, and that she should just go with this love for the other mermaid. She gently kissed Jenna on the nose.</p>
<p>Jenna opened her eyes and smiled at her new sister mermaid. &ldquo;Hello beautiful,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Manami replied quietly, then kissed Jenna full on the lips. The two mermaids slowly disengaged from their sleeping mate and wrapped their tails around each other. Gently exploring their new bodies and new bond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; Jenna said. Coming to terms with the feelings that had been foreign to her until now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you too, sister,&rdquo; Manami replied.</p>
<p>Josh woke up to a strange feeling: there was no one curled up against him. For the past month, whether human or merman, he&rsquo;d at least had Jenna curled up with him. His moment of concern stopped short when his mer senses picked up Jenna and Manami just in front of him. He opened his eyes to see Jenna and Manami embracing in front of him. How lucky was he? He saw these two very different, but very beautiful women embracing in front of him. Manami&rsquo;s silver tail entwined with Jenna&rsquo;s pink. His mates, his family. He would gladly lay down his life for them, but that was only half of his bond to them. He also had to be strong enough to live for them. He had to be there for them in every way. To support, protect, to ensure that they and their children lived on and thrived, for these two wouldn&rsquo;t just be his mates and lovers, but would ensure his legacy through the children they bore. He floated, in awe of them. He was only broken from his revelry by Jenna turning that electric smile towards him, followed by Manami and her deep, soulful eyes.</p>
<p>He pushed himself forward and wrapped his arms around both of his mermaids in a great hug, trying to project the depth of his feelings to them. To somehow let them know what they meant to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, don&rsquo;t crush us with a bear hug!&rdquo; Jenna said. Josh unwrapped his arms with a sheepish look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just woke up, and you weren&rsquo;t there, and then I saw you both there and I just knew I had to hold you in my arms again,&rdquo; Josh said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were just having some girl time,&rdquo; Jenna admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I think I had that dream when I was 13!&rdquo; Josh said with crooked smile. He turned to Manami and looked her up and down. &ldquo;Silver with purple. Beautiful! Let&rsquo;s get you out in the open water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds fun,&rdquo; Manami replied. &ldquo;But we should get food too and take it to Sarah. I want to see how she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; Jenna said. The three mers slowly headed out of the grotto to spend the morning playing in the reefs.</p>
<p>Sarah had awoken with the dawn. She was sick to death of coconuts, but with her luck, the Loch Ness Monster would be waiting for her in the lagoon. She settled down to a terrestrial breakfast again when she saw a mermaid come flying out of the lagoon, shrieking in joy as she did a backflip in the air and straightened out to reenter the water with no splash. The mermaid obviously wasn&rsquo;t Jenna. This mermaid had a silver tail and black hair. So they&rsquo;d done it. Manami was a mermaid. She felt like she&rsquo;d failed somehow. One of her goals had always been to get Manami home. She wasn&rsquo;t going back to Japan looking like that!</p>
<p>Manami giggled as she came down from her jump. Josh and Jenna just smiled at her infectious enthusiasm. Manami&rsquo;s face fell quickly as she saw one of the small white tipped reef sharks working its way among the rocks and coral, likely looking for a meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manami,&rdquo; Josh cautioned. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t hurt you. I won&rsquo;t let it,&rdquo; he set off to chase the shark away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Manami said. &ldquo;Thank you, but I can&rsquo;t be afraid forever,&rdquo; she swam off towards the shark. Josh fought every instinct he had to barge in and rip the shark&rsquo;s heart out right there, but he knew that a mermaid that was afraid to swim in her own lagoon just wouldn&rsquo;t be right.</p>
<p>Manami sped off towards the shark. Just as she was about to run into it head-on, she pulled up and smacked the shark in the head with her tail fin, a sharp thwack reverberating through the water. The shark sped off, not willing to stick around this strange creature that could have been trying to eat it for all it knew.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Manami knew that that wasn&rsquo;t one of the sharks that had torn her sister&rsquo;s body apart. Sharks hadn&rsquo;t even killed Miki, the plane crash had. But for some reason, chasing that shark off gave her her power back. She loved Josh, and understood his need to protect her, but she needed to prove to herself that she was more than a victim.</p>
<p>Josh and Jenna sensed the change in their mate, they shared a smile and swam up to either side of her, kissing her on each cheek. &ldquo;Nice one dear,&rdquo; Jenna said.</p>
<p>Manami blushed at the attention. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see Sarah. I think it&rsquo;s time we talked about a few things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah sat whittling a piece of palm tree with the knife. She knew that they should keep it sharp, but she didn&rsquo;t give a damn at the moment. She didn&rsquo;t hear Josh, Jenna, and Manami emerge from the surf. Only the gentle rustling of the sand alerted her to their presence. She looked up and started. She&rsquo;d been so lost in thought that they had gotten within six feet of her before she noticed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t startle me like that!&rdquo; she chided them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m old, remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Manami said with a bright smile. &ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; she asked as she turned to the side and stretched out her silver tail. It refracted every color in the rainbow, sparkling beautifully in the sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very pretty,&rdquo; Sarah said matter-of-factly as she continued whittling, trying to put up a cool front. She couldn&rsquo;t fool the mers though. The storm of emotions raging within her was well-known even if it didn&rsquo;t light up their mer senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarah, we&rsquo;ve been talking, and, we want to ask you-&rdquo; Jenna started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to ask me to be his mermaid. To give up everything and submit. I won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; she practically growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to submit,&rdquo; Josh said. &ldquo;I never have. Loving someone isn&rsquo;t submission, not really. It&rsquo;s a mutual respect and understanding that can&rsquo;t be equaled. I want to be your husband, your pod mate. Will you please join us and-&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what?&rdquo; Sarah almost yelled. Both parts of her fully at war. Half of her screaming &ldquo;YES!&rdquo; to the heavens and the other half wanting to run away to the ocean to escape the fate that stood before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead our pod,&rdquo; Jenna finished Josh&rsquo;s sentence. &ldquo;We need a pod leader. I&rsquo;m not much of a leader, and Manami doesn&rsquo;t want the job either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Josh was the big dominant pod-leading man,&rdquo; Sarah said mockingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mermaids are in charge,&rdquo; Josh said. &ldquo;I know that I&rsquo;m a blunt instrument. I feel instincts inside me that I know make me unsuitable to lead the pod. I want to take out anything bigger than a bait fish that comes near Jenna and Manami. We need someone to strategize, to keep a cool head in a bad situation. We need you. I need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I need you. Sarah had heard that one before, but never with the earnestness that Josh had said it, nor with two other women nodding their heads in agreement. She turned away to think, weighing the pros and cons. Work, stress, loneliness, indoor plumbing, internet, chocolate. Love, paradise, freedom, predators, exploitation, isolation. In the end, what was most important to her?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you expect from me,&rdquo; she said with her back turned to the mers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expect you to be yourself. The best you you can be, actually,&rdquo; Manami replied. &ldquo;We need that to survive here. It&rsquo;s just us, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah shut her eyes, letting one tear flow down her cheek. She took a deep, racking breath, and in her exhalation she let out all of her fear and stress. She let go of all the baggage from her old life. She embraced the pod, the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay. I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; Jenna and Manami cheered and Josh broke into a smile. Sarah smiled at Manami. &ldquo;I owe you anyway,&rdquo; she walked up to her tiara as it hung on the bush and picked up the light silver metal object. Sarah placed it on her head, pushing the bands through her short hair until it sat firmly against her forehead. &ldquo;So what now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need milk. I can help with that,&rdquo; Jenna said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all the same Jenna, I&rsquo;d like to feed her first,&rdquo; Manami asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Jenna agreed.</p>
<p>Manami brushed her thick black hair back over her shoulders, fully baring her breasts. Sarah laid her head down on Manami&rsquo;s lap, and took one of her C-cup breasts into her hand. She only hesitated for a moment before she began to suckle, tasting Manami&rsquo;s sweet, rich mermaid milk. Almost immediately, she began to feel the siren cells spreading out through her body, beginning the work of healing and youthening her body. Manami moaned in the pleasure and hormone rush that accompanied feeding. Sarah eventually drained the first breast and switched to the second. She felt hands on her lower legs, and moved her eyes to see Josh and Jenna each place a hand on one of her legs, looking into her eyes with smiles, not of triumph, but of love and welcoming. Sarah allowed herself to smile back. She was going to be a mermaid, the leader and glue of a pod.</p>
<p>Josh went and got lunch, leaving the three women alone on the beach. Sarah sat admiring Manami&rsquo;s tail, while Jenna sat behind Manami and began combing her hair the way Rose and her sisters had done for her on the beach a month ago. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d have thought?&rdquo; Manami mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought what?&rdquo; Jenna said as she continued to comb out Manami&rsquo;s long hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;d be a mermaid, and that Sarah would be on the way to joining us,&rdquo; Manami said. &ldquo;I was so sure a month ago that I just wanted to get out of here. I think&hellip; I think it was seeing you and Josh so happy together, even before you changed, that really convinced me to do it. I couldn&rsquo;t go home, go back, not really. I guess I had to go forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did,&rdquo; Jenna said. &ldquo;You know, Josh and I felt bonded to you two. Especially after we changed. It was wonderful, but, I think we bonded to you from the first time we fed from Rose&rsquo;s pod. We just weren&rsquo;t complete without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah sat up. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, then, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, she leaned in and gave Manami a quick peck on the lips, blushing the whole time. &ldquo;Actually, that explains what I felt. I felt constant desire for Josh. I figured the siren cells had affected me, but I didn&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;d affected you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could tell, there was only one reason why you would be that openly hostile to Josh: you liked him, but didn&rsquo;t want to like him,&rdquo; Jenna said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is okay, but like I told Manami, I didn&rsquo;t like that I was forced to feel that way,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I guess what pushed me over the edge was you asking me to lead you. You gave me the choice, or at least the illusion of it. I appreciate that. I also meant what I said about owing Manami. She saved my life, and I guess, I feel responsible for her. Remember what I told you that first night on the island, Jenna, that story about my friend&rsquo;s son whose father died and couldn&rsquo;t hear music without reliving that?&rdquo; Jenna nodded. Sarah went on. &ldquo;I wanted to help him, but the family wouldn&rsquo;t let me in. I think, by taking care of Manami, it will make up for not being able to help my friend&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenna and Manami smiled. &ldquo;We may not have to take care of Manami, she chased off a shark before we came ashore, kicked its ass! Called off Josh all &lsquo;I got this dude!'&rdquo; she said with a mockingly false deep voice and an arm extended as if she was barring someone else&rsquo;s way..</p>
<p>Sarah laughed, both at Jenna&rsquo;s impression and Manami&rsquo;s embarrassed blushing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s great, but I have two questions: Is it still kicking ass when you don&rsquo;t have feet, and since when do sharks have asses?&rdquo; she said with a sarcastic tone of voice.</p>
<p>The three of them had a great belly laugh. As they finished up, Josh returned with lunch, mostly shellfish, to help build up protein in Sarah for the changes she&rsquo;d be undergoing and to keep Manami and Jenna fed as they produced milk to feed her. The four of them ate on the beach, Manami enjoyed popping open the oysters herself instead of waiting for Josh or Sarah to pop them open with a knife. It was funny how in becoming a mermaid, tightly bound to two mates, she&rsquo;d gained a measure of independence she hadn&rsquo;t had since they&rsquo;d crashed. It felt good to be strong and independent again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Sarah asked as she finished off the last of her oysters, &ldquo;When do I feed again?&rdquo; she asked the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;all excited for boobs now?&rdquo; Jenna teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very funny. I&rsquo;m just curious about it,&rdquo; Sarah replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give Manami&rsquo;s milk a chance to work, Jenna can feed you before dinner,&rdquo; Josh suggested. &ldquo;When your gills come in, we&rsquo;ll show you some of the deeper parts of the lagoon, though I think we&rsquo;ll save the grotto where we changed until we&rsquo;re all actually ready to change you,&rdquo; he added with a meaningful look at Manami.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Sarah asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She jumped the gun a bit on her change,&rdquo; Josh explained. &ldquo;We were going to wait a few hours until Jenna was full of milk again, but I guess Manami got excited thinking about her change and started the process. We had to scramble a bit, but it still worked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you complaining?&rdquo; Manami asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mermaid and we all had sex at the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not complaining. I&rsquo;m just stating that I think we should be prepared when we go to change Sarah,&rdquo; Josh retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a swim,&rdquo; Jenna suggested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just stay on the surface, maybe go to the grass field and play in the shallows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three other pod members agreed and they headed out. Josh swam on the surface, supporting Sarah on his chest just as he had Manami a couple of days before. Sarah relaxed and let Josh do the work, feeling his smooth skin against her body. She felt even more desire for him than before, if that was even possible. She even wondered at the feeling of his long swimming muscles pulling his tail up and down. She looked up at his face and saw his confident, calm visage looking ahead to the horizon. He seemed perfectly at ease with his new form, even though he&rsquo;d had it for only a few days. Would she take to her tail that easily?</p>
<p>Josh felt Sarah&rsquo;s gaze and looked back at her, thinking she already looked a little younger, at least in his eyes. Knowing that she was joining them made him much less stressed than before. He hoped to make her happy, whatever that meant to her. He locked eyes with her and smiled. She smiled back, warmly. There were times he honestly thought he&rsquo;d never see that, but he was thrilled to see it now. He looked back toward where he was swimming. Sarah laid her head down on his chest and enjoyed feeling his muscles flex as he swam.</p>
<p>Soon enough, and far faster than any human could have done it, the pod arrived in the shallowest part of the sea grass plain on the eastern edge of the atoll. Sarah paddled along as best she could, with no hope of keeping up with Jenna and Manami as they streaked along the bottom, occasionally stroking her with their tail flukes as they passed by. They played until their passions got the better of them, and Jenna tackled Josh into the shallow water, kissing him deeply and pawing at his vent. He released his vent and entered her, eliciting a mutual moan.</p>
<p>Manami felt herself become aroused as she watched her mates make love in the shallows. She pulled up next to Sarah, who was blushing as she watched Josh and Jenna unleash their passions on each other. Manami sidled up to Sarah as she floated in the water and put her arm around her waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you flirting with me?&rdquo; Sarah asked as she looked into Manami&rsquo;s dreamy bedroom eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came Manami&rsquo;s sensual reply.</p>
<p>Sarah was taken aback. For the time that she&rsquo;d known Manami, the young Japanese woman had seemed so vulnerable, so emotionally fragile. Becoming a mermaid had imbued her with a strength Sarah hadn&rsquo;t seen before. Had something happened in the transition to cause such a change, or was it a result of the love and support that the mer bonds gave? She&rsquo;d find out soon enough.</p>
<p>Manami leaned in and kissed Sarah gently, and Sarah felt herself returning it. She&rsquo;d been straight all of her life, even if she&rsquo;d hardly had time for sex and had never really had a meaningful relationship. Just as their kiss deepened, Josh and Jenna screamed their second orgasm; or was it third? Josh rolled off Jenna and lay half in and half out of the water, his member straight up in the air and a smile on his face as he held Jenna&rsquo;s hand. Manami kept hold of Sarah and headed in towards Josh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My turn,&rdquo; Manami said when they reached the relaxing couple. Josh had stayed ready, his body seemed to know on its own that he had another mermaid to satisfy. Manami moved in and kissed him, laying herself on him as she&rsquo;d seen Jenna do the night she&rsquo;d decided to become a mermaid. Josh entered her and she raised herself up, holding hands with Josh as he made love to her.</p>
<p>Sarah sat down in shallow water, marveling at the intensely erotic scene playing out in front of her. Suddenly, she felt Jenna&rsquo;s hand trace up her back. She&rsquo;d taken her slip off to go swimming, so there was nothing but underwear between her and Jenna. The pink mermaid put her arm around her waist, and pulled her away from the shallows out into water she could float in. The two of them floated together upright, Jenna gently kissing Sarah&rsquo;s neck, trying to get the older woman to relax a little. Jenna&rsquo;s right hand slowly moved down Sarah&rsquo;s back, around her waist to the front of her lower stomach, gently probing, trying to to startle her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha..,&rdquo; Sarah started to say, then she moaned as Jenna&rsquo;s hand slipped downward and began pleasuring her. Jenna smiled as Sarah panted in her passion, quickly rising to a moaning orgasm that drained her. Sarah&rsquo;s whole body relaxed and she went almost limp, laying her head on Jenna&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Jenna let herself lay back in the water, not moving her hand from Sarah&rsquo;s underwear. She thrust out her beautiful breasts, inviting Sarah to drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Sarah panted &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a little early?&rdquo; It was only about 4 o&rsquo;clock, they had planned the feeding for before dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s late enough,&rdquo; Jenna cooed.</p>
<p>Sarah was in no shape to argue, she took Jenna&rsquo;s nipple into her mouth and suckled, the milk flowed into her mouth, and she moaned into the nipple as Jenna kept gently massaging her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You already look younger,&rdquo; Jenna whispered. &ldquo;Your hair is getting longer too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah just surrendered to the dual feelings of the siren cells moving through her body and Jenna&rsquo;s ministrations, Sarah felt orgasms roll over her again and again as she fed from first the right, then the left orb in front of her. Once Jenna&rsquo;s milk finally ran out, she swam them both back to shore, washing up next to a cuddling Manami and Josh, they themselves having finished their multiple orgasm session. The four of them lay exhausted on the beach, watching the sun sink in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner may be delayed on account of awesome sex,&rdquo; Jenna finally quipped before falling asleep, no reply came forth from her three pod mates, they were already out like a light.</p>
<p>The four pod mates awoke after sundown. The moon was full in a cloudless sky, so there was enough light even for Sarah after her eyes adjusted. The three mers were even better off. The extra cones and rods in their eyes picked up every scrap of light in the area, making the moonlight almost as bright as day, even if it wasn&rsquo;t quite as sharp. It was almost like wearing light intensification night vision goggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, now I&rsquo;m hungry,&rdquo; Jenna said as her stomach rumbled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go get dinner Manami.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good,&rdquo; Sarah chimed in as Manami nodded. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you meet us back at the raft? I&rsquo;d still like to sleep under some cover tonight, if that&rsquo;s okay. Josh, would you swim me back over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he agreed. The two mermaids slipped off into the water and headed out to find food, while Josh ferried Sarah back across the surface of the lagoon. Ordinarily, Sarah would have been terrified, being out in the water at night, in a lagoon where a predator had already taken a swipe at her, but she just felt, safe, with Josh. When did that happen? She&rsquo;d been contemptuous, sometimes downright mean to him in the month they&rsquo;d been marooned together, but now, he felt like the safest person in the world. Maybe it was because he was the apex predator in this whole lagoon? She looked up at his face again as he swam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said to him as he let her go so she could stand up once they reached their home beach. He looked up, taken aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For being a bitch,&rdquo; she replied, shoulders slumped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were doing what you thought was best for Manami and yourself,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Nothing wrong with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you just forgive like that?&rdquo; Sarah asked, exasperated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the right thing to do. Look, I admit I was mad at you too for a while, I was ready to just change with Jenna and tow you to California if need be, but then I sensed you in the water and that shark after you, and I realize now just how deep these mer bonds are. I love you,&rdquo; he said with a shrug.</p>
<p>They moved up onto the beach to wait for Jenna and Manami. As they sat with each other, Sarah leaned over on impulse, and kissed him on the mouth. He returned the kiss gently. She pulled back with a smile on her face, and they lay together hugging until dinner arrived.</p>
<p>Dinner was quiet, the four of them concentrating on filling their bellies. After dinner, Sarah fed from Manami, and the four of them curled up inside the raft to keep Sarah warm, the three mer tails hanging out the front of the raft.</p>
<p>No one woke up until mid-morning, when the raft got a little too warm and the mers too dry to stand being in there. As they untangled, Sarah noticed that she felt, lighter, somehow, and more flexible than she had in years. Jenna turned and looked at Sarah, and her eyes bulged wide. Manami looked to see what she was staring at, and her mouth gaped open. Josh was equally agog as he looked at Sarah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Did I grow a horn, I&rsquo;m not going to be a mermaid, but a unicorn?&rdquo; she joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder all those men chased after you for so many years,&rdquo; Manami said with a smile.</p>
<p>Sarah got a puzzled look on her face and stood up. She noticed immediately that her center of gravity was off, her hips were wider and she felt constricted around her chest. She walked over, picked up the signal mirror and gasped. It was her face, age no more than 25, but not. It was as if someone had gone over it with an airbrush, every little detail improved just a little bit. She had fuller lips than she&rsquo;d had in her prime, slightly more almond-shaped eyes, her cheekbones were a hair more prominent. It was herself, carried to the nth degree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&hellip; I never looked like this,&rdquo; she said, holding a lock of her hair that was now halfway down her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;all look hot,&rdquo; Jenna said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, this&rsquo;ll work!&rdquo; Sarah said. &ldquo;Ow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Josh asked, concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My bra&rsquo;s tight,&rdquo; Sarah admitted. Slowly, she took it off, symbolically shedding yet another piece of her old life in the process. She blushed, still a little embarrassed at being topless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get breakfast and let Sarah get used to things,&rdquo; Josh suggested, and the three mers headed off into the water to gather food again.</p>
<p>Sarah kept looking herself over, amazed at the changes. She hadn&rsquo;t felt this good in years. Her hair was long, thick and silky. She&rsquo;d have killed for hair like this when she was in college. She looked down again. Her breasts had to be at least a c-cup, same size as Manami, though she figured it would go up again. Her stomach was smooth and flat, beautifully toned, and her legs were world class. Victoria&rsquo;s Secret models eat your heart out!</p>
<p>The mers returned quickly with food, and the four of them ate heartily, before Sarah once again drained Jenna&rsquo;s breasts. Now, she could really feel the power building in her. Her back tingled, and she could feel the pressure from her mates&rsquo; desires pushing in on her.</p>
<p>By the time lunch rolled around, Sarah&rsquo;s hair was down to her waist, and by dinner, she&rsquo;d grown webbing on her hands and had full gills on her back. She was close, very close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you want to change?&rdquo; Josh asked as she marveled at the webbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we, can we do it in the morning? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;m excited to change, but, can I have just one more night with legs?&rdquo; Sarah asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure,&rdquo; Jenna answered.</p>
<p>The four of them spent one more night snuggled in the raft. As she lay there, curled up amongst the scaly tails, Sarah stroked her legs. She took a moment to think things over one last time, and again came to the same decision: she&rsquo;d lead this pod. Be their manager, field general, and team captain. It was a big responsibility, but she felt that she was up for it. It sure beat sales meetings and quarterly numbers. She smiled slightly at what her old secretary or her subordinates would say if they could see her now. She looked like she could blend in with the junior sales force. She drifted off to sleep to the sound of the breathing of her pod mates and the waves lapping over the sand.</p>
<p>Sarah woke up that morning, finding herself alone in the raft. The air was dead still, she couldn&rsquo;t even hear the sea. It was as if the world around her paused, waiting for something momentous to happen. She rose and checked herself. She was still young and beautiful, but she also noticed her hair had continued growing in the night, reaching down to her waist, far longer than she&rsquo;d ever worn it. She looked at her hands and saw the webbing reaching to her lowest knuckle. It was definitely time, but where were the others? She picked herself up and headed out of the raft. She saw them arranged in a semi-circle, sitting up on their fins, with a pile of shellfish sitting in front of them, waiting for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big day,&rdquo; Manami replied, Josh and Jenna nodding in agreement. &ldquo;Eat up, you&rsquo;ll need your strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah sat and picked up one of the carefully arrayed pre-shucked oysters that had been laid out for her. After she gulped it down, she noticed that no one else was eating. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not hungry?&rdquo; she asked the three mers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We already ate. We&rsquo;re ready, we just need you,&rdquo; Jenna replied.</p>
<p>Sarah finished eating quickly, and it was time to go. Jenna and Josh parted, making a path to the lagoon. Sarah took off her underwear, her last bit of clothes. Sarah felt silly walking between them, and rolled her eyes. The mers followed her to the water as Sarah savored the last steps she&rsquo;d take on two legs. Once the water was too deep to walk, Manami supported her as they began to swim out. The water deepened, and the mers prepared to dive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you need air, just tap my shoulder,&rdquo; Manami said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re far enough along that your gills should be working, but remember just in case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Sarah said. &ldquo;Do I need to do anything to use my gills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Josh said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll just start working. But if you feel short of air, do as Manami said and we&rsquo;ll give you fresh air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah nodded, and the four of them dove. Deeper and deeper into the blue waters of the lagoon they dove, down to the grotto 35 feet down where Josh, Jenna, and Manami had all become mers. Sarah concentrated on her breathing, trying to feel for any shortness of breath. They quickly arrived at the entrance to the grotto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you need air?&rdquo; Manami asked Sarah, who noticed that no bubbles came from Manami&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>Sarah realized that she didn&rsquo;t and shook her head. The mers smiled, her gills must be working. She didn&rsquo;t really feel any different, she was just 35 feet down and didn&rsquo;t need to breathe.</p>
<p>Manami pulled her into the grotto, following Josh and Jenna, placing Sarah in the center of the grotto, surrounded at three points by her pod mates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need to concentrate on your tail. Think about changing, becoming a mermaid. We&rsquo;ll feed you if it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s going to happen,&rdquo; Josh said.</p>
<p>Sarah nodded and closed her eyes, concentrating on her tail. She felt the siren cells within her awaken, racing around, the power building and building. She felt pressure coming from three directions around her, the concentration of her pod mates making itself known. The same power that Josh, Jenna and Manami had experienced roared through her, it was almost enough, but as she approached the tip over, it stopped and went no further.</p>
<p>Jenna sensed this and knew just what to do. She floated up to Sarah with a serene look on her face, and held her breasts up. &ldquo;Drink. You&rsquo;re almost there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah leaned forward and took the proffered nipple into her mouth, sucking down milk. She drained Jenna&rsquo;s breasts, then instinctively moved to Manami&rsquo;s breasts and took even more milk. She was so very close, but there was no more milk to be had. She looked at Jenna frantically. Jenna smiled and guided her over to Josh. Sarah looked puzzled, but her eyes went wide when Jenna started rubbing Josh&rsquo;s vent. Josh pulled on his vent muscle and his member emerged. Sarah was about to refuse, but she realized that this was necessary to fully bond with her entire pod, as well as give her the siren cells necessary to change. She looked up at Josh&rsquo;s face and saw that he didn&rsquo;t have a licentious look on his face, but a loving and apologetic expression. She steeled herself and took him into her mouth, sucking gently. Josh quickly erupted into her mouth, and she concentrated on the mermaid that she wanted to be. She finally felt the power of the cells tip over for her final transformation, throwing her arms out and her head back as the changes began kicking in fully and she floated back to the center of the grotto.</p>
<p>The mers began humming, concentrating on their podmate, pushing her through each step of the change. First, her legs lost definition, merging together, eventually becoming one. Sarah felt the urge to push down and went with it, her internal organs, muscles, and skeleton shifting into a decidedly mermaid configuration. Her mer organs formed, and her mer senses began to feed her information, and completing her bond to her pod mates. What she had only experienced as lust before, poured into her as the perfect, unconditional, completely requited love of the mer bonding. The feeling overwhelmed her. She&rsquo;d never know how empty her heart and soul had been until they&rsquo;d been filled by this perfection. She shed tears at the beauty of it. She&rsquo;d fought this? What an utter fool she had been. This was bliss, this was love. In her heart of hearts, she gave herself to her pod mates. She would be their glue, their lover, the unifier of their pod.</p>
<p>Sarah felt what had been her legs crack, the bones separating as the mass from her waist down came ever closer to becoming a tail. She winced, but the change&rsquo;s healing powers took her pain away. She grew longer and longer in the water, then felt her feet stretch and contort, ankles melting into the base of her fluke stretching out below her, bringing her to Jenna&rsquo;s nine feet. Fins grew out of her tail where her knees had been, along with her pelvic fins and fins at her elbow</p>
<p>The color of her tail began to shift, becoming a mixture of Josh&rsquo;s blue and Manami&rsquo;s silver, with the fringes of her fins from Jenna&rsquo;s pink tail, signifying her role as the leader and uniter of the pod. Her own strong personality melded the equally strong personalities of her pod into a single purpose, while maintaining the individuality of each member. She felt the last waves of changes roll through her, the final ecstatic rushes as her tail curled up behind her head, her change complete as they released her. Finally completed and able to recognize her surroundings, she realized that the grotto was darker than it had been when they&rsquo;d started. The sun was low in the sky, her change had taken the entire morning and afternoon. She straightened out and looked down at herself. Her breasts had grown to a D-cup, her waist had cinched in slightly. She luxuriated in the feeling of her new muscles as they rippled through her tail and torso. It was so alien, but it felt so good. Her attention turned, finally, to her pod mates. The three of them floated around her, smiling as she took in her new form.</p>
<p>Jenna and Manami swam up to her, hugging her in joy. &ldquo;The bonding is amazing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Jenna asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cried when it started, I can&rsquo;t believe I was so afraid of this. It&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; she gushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gets better,&rdquo; Manami said with a sultry voice, as the post-change lust began to overtake the mermaids. Manami&rsquo;s silver tail began to flash, along with Jenna&rsquo;s pink light. Sarah felt her lust come on as well. Her tail began flashing, but not with any single light. Her tail flashed with the colors of all three pod mates, mixing with their colors to create a symphony of light.</p>
<p>Josh watched as his three mates turned toward him. Their love and desire evident on their faces. He realized now, just how much trouble he was in. These three mermaids had him wrapped around their little fingers, and they had no intention of ever letting him go. Then again, what was wrong with that? Devotion was hardly a high price to pay for being mated to the amazing beauties in front of him. His three mates swam up to him slowly, with predatory smiles on their faces. he was being stalked, but this was the good kind of stalking. He felt his own ardor rise, and he released his vent.</p>
<p>First Jenna, then Manami arrived on each side, then Sarah pulled up and wrapped her tail around his. She confidently aligned herself with him, and he thrust to meet her movement. The mutual movement brought them together quickly, both gasping at the pleasure of filling and being filled. Jenna and Manami wrapped their tails around the mating couple and pressed themselves into Josh&rsquo;s vibrating pelvic fins, groaning their pleasure as the pod made love.</p>
<p>Josh and Sarah kissed as they mated for the first time. Their bonds deepened as they had their first orgasm together. Their eyes met as they continued pumping. For the first time in her life, Sarah had a lover that she knew for certain wasn&rsquo;t out for some business advantage, or to aggrandize himself, or prove his manhood or racial superiority. He just loved her, and wanted to show it. For just a fleeting moment, she thought that, maybe, children were in the cards, would they have some mix of tail colors from the pod? As Josh thrust into her, she wondered at his big blue eyes, would a baby have those, or her brown eyes?</p>
<p>Suddenly, a muscle she&rsquo;d never felt before, had a spasm in her tail, and it squeezed down uncontrollably on Josh and started pumping him on its own. An orgasm bigger than any she&rsquo;d ever felt tore through her body, causing her to scream out in the most incredible pleasure she&rsquo;d ever felt. It overwhelmed her, and lost consciousness. Josh was literally twitching in pleasure, but when he saw Sarah&rsquo;s eyes roll back, he nearly panicked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josh, calm down,&rdquo; Jenna panted as she disengaged from his pelvic fin. &ldquo;Use your mer senses, she&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; he did calm down, Sarah was indeed fine. After a few moments, Sarah woke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh, what happened?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mermaid now and I still can&rsquo;t keep from fainting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you had fun this time!&rdquo; Manami teased. &ldquo;You could still have some,&rdquo; she pointed down. Josh was still fully inside Sarah, and didn&rsquo;t seem to be budging. After a moment, Josh was finally able to pull out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s never happened before,&rdquo; Josh said with a concerned voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s over now,&rdquo; Jenna said. &ldquo;We still need that too,&rdquo; she declared as she wrapped her tail around Josh&rsquo;s and moved to take him inside her. Manami followed her lead and returned to Josh&rsquo;s pelvic fin to bide her time. Sarah thought for a moment about what had happened, but, ultimately, it had been wonderful, and so she decided that figuring things out could wait until tomorrow. There was still plenty of enjoyment to be had tonight. She pressed herself against Josh&rsquo;s available pelvic fin as she&rsquo;d seen her pod mates do and settled in for another few orgasms.</p>
<p>The four new mers, the completed pod, continued expressing their love deep into the night. They finally collapsed into a deep sleep in the wee hours of the morning. Sated and deeply bonded. A family united in the sea.</p>
<p>Sarah laid out on the beach near the raft, her tail sparkling in the sunlight as she waited for her mates to return. They had insisted that they get the food for some reason. She wasn&rsquo;t complaining, she just wanted them to come back soon. She ran her hands up and down her sides, around the transition between skin and scales, and up over her breasts and tweaked her nipples in joy. She felt so wonderful in this new body. Being a mermaid was awesome! She just couldn&rsquo;t wait to get another opportunity to show her lovers how much she appreciated them.</p>
<p>Josh, Jenna, and Manami emerged from the water soon after, carrying lunch. Sarah felt ravenous, and dug in quickly after thanking them. &ldquo;What, are you pregnant or something?&rdquo; Jenna teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, just hungry,&rdquo; Sarah said as she continued to munch on sea grasses.</p>
<p>The four of them ate, then stretched out on the beach to let the food in their tummies settle. They lounged about, happy, content and loved. As she dozed off, Jenna caught something moving in the sky, it was a glint of sunlight off of a metallic object in the sky. When she opened her eyes fully, the object resolved into an aircraft, flying high over their atoll, the first they&rsquo;d seen in the five weeks they&rsquo;d been there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy are they lost!&rdquo; she said out loud.</p>
<p>The other mers opened their eyes and looked up, quickly spotting the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; Josh guffawed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you&rsquo;re kidding me!&rdquo; Sarah said with a shake of your head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we should invite them for a visit?&rdquo; Manami joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d enjoy hanging around you three,&rdquo; Josh said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;d enjoy,&rdquo; Sarah said as she sat up. &ldquo;You three. In the water, right now,&rdquo; she said suggestively as she headed for the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got it Fearless Leader!&rdquo; Jenna said as she splashed into the water after her.</p>
<p>Manami smiled as she silently headed in.</p>
<p>Josh watched the plane for a moment longer, thinking of how far they&rsquo;d come, how much had changed in just a short month. As he felt his tail, he wondered what else could possibly happen that could be more incredible than this. The future would take care of itself though. For now, there was the wonderful present, and the love of these amazing women. He headed down to the water and splashed in, ready to express just how much he cared for his mates, his wives, his loves.</p>
