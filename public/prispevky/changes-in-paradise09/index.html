            <p>New mers bond with their new pod-mates, the Connors finally make landfall and discover the changes and more, but they cannot stay, at least not all of them. The story continues.</p>
<p>Alexis sat on a low rock near Rocky Cove, her tail mostly in the water as she raised her breasts toward the morning sun, enjoying the warmth on her face and upper torso. Liga floated in the water next to her, her head resting on Alexis' lap, keeping her growing belly in the water where it was more comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Liga exclaimed, pointing out to sea. &ldquo;Watch how high they can go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alexis turned her face away from the sun and focused on the water closer to the rocks on which she sat. She saw two royal blue mertails slice into the water from what must have been a vertical re-entry, barely a splash raised by their broad and strong flukes. A few seconds later, both Eric and Sally erupted from the water a few meters further out, arching high into the air, topping out at nearly four meters above the surface of the water.</p>
<p>Their tails were gleaming in the morning sun, the water cascading off of their strong and sinewy bodies, and their torsos facing towards the sky. They twisted in unison, turning over onto their backs as they pointed their hands back towards the water. Their bodies followed the perfect line of their hands, straightening back out as they passed through the top of the arc, their pelvic and mid-tail fins at perfect forty-five degree angles out from their tails, and their flukes were parallel to their shoulders. They both sliced back into the waves, arrow straight, with no splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our new mates are strong,&rdquo; Alexis observed, stroking Liga&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And beautiful,&rdquo; Liga said wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And much bigger than Ag—&rdquo; Alexis said, remembering the previous evening with a lusty smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Liga interrupted. &ldquo;No talk of Agba and Angara. It&rsquo;s &hellip; it&rsquo;s &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Alexis said, caressing the petite mermaid&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I am sorry. We should not compare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Liga said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because we are &hellip; they are &hellip; we haven&rsquo;t &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Alexis said, putting her hand on Liga&rsquo;s forehead. &ldquo;It has to be done, and we must bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t have to like it,&rdquo; Liga sighed.</p>
<p>Together, they watched their new pod-mates play and tried not to think about why Eric and Sally had suggested that the pod go to the eastern caves this morning. Their former pod mates were undergoing an autopsy.</p>
<p>Malaki straightened up from the table, set down the magnifying glass he had been using, and rubbed his temples. The last radio report from Tumibay indicated that he had come within a few kilometers of the signal &gt;from Alberto&rsquo;s boat, and he would be going after them that night. That message was four days ago. Three days ago, a second message was sent, but it wasn&rsquo;t Tumibay, and whoever was talking wasn&rsquo;t making much sense, raving about sea monsters that were destroying the boat, ripping it apart. The signal had been lost, but Malaki&rsquo;s operator, who had spoken to the raving man, thought Tumibay&rsquo;s crew had been drinking.</p>
<p>Sea monsters? Impossible! Ripping apart a boat? Tumibay&rsquo;s boat was one of Malaki&rsquo;s finest yachts. Alberto must have cooked up something unexpected. Malaki sighed as he picked the magnifying glass again. There were several small islands and atolls within 20 kilometers of Tumibay&rsquo;s last reported position. Some were barely a sand bar in the ocean, while others were more substantial, their volcano cores still smoldering. He identified ten islands that could hide Alberto and his men, but he could find no sign of Alberto&rsquo;s boats. He needed more information before he sent another team out in search of his problematic minion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Chin,&rdquo; he barked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>The pretty, Chinese secretary walked carefully into his large office. She was rarely called into his office, and when she was, she knew that her next task would involve something illegal. Shen Chin had always been a bright child, the best in her small, rural school outside of Guangzhou, and had won a scholarship, through relatives in Hong Kong, to go to college at Oxford. She had brought great honor to her family, and when she graduated, she hoped to work for a multi-national company. Dimaunahan Industries had seemed, at first, a great start. Two years ago, when she was first hired, she tried to know as much as possible about Malaki&rsquo;s business, but he kept nearly everything hidden.</p>
<p>Once her sister was kidnapped, that all changed. Malaki did his homework; Shen loved her family and her older sister. Once he kidnapped Lin, he forced Shen &ldquo;into the fold&rdquo; as his trustworthy executive assistant by threatening both Lin&rsquo;s life and the honor of her family. Now, she tried to know as little as possible and only came into his office when ordered. Only the knowledge that her good behavior here kept Lin alive allowed Shen to do the things Malaki ordered her to do.</p>
<p>Malaki found that such &ldquo;recruitment&rdquo; techniques worked very well for a few years before a new secretary was necessary. Men or women, it didn&rsquo;t matter. After two or three years, they were killed or sent to the brothels. Malaki liked the system because the one person who knew the most about his empire was also the most temporary. It made secrets easier to keep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Manalo to get me all the information on our current business arrangements with Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, and any other governments in this area,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;I want to know every detail of every transaction that we might have had for the last year in these locations,&rdquo; he pointed at the map, indicating that she should take notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get me a list of all the government officials we have under our influence or who owe me a favor in the surrounding areas,&rdquo; he said as he strolled back to his large window overlooking the city. &ldquo;I want both reports back to me by the end of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His oldest son, Manalo, had been clamoring for more responsibilities in his business for some time. Well, it was time to see what kind of backbone the boy had.</p>
<p>The lab cave was one of the largest caves that the mers inhabited. The expansive floor of the brightly lit cave was littered with equipment, wires, and storage racks. Most of the larger equipment had been moved to the edges of the cave, and two long steel tables were in the center of the room. The tables, which were some of the largest pieces of equipment in the room, were three meters long and one meter wide, and were perched on gurneys that the mers had cut down to 30 cm (one foot) high. Equipment much longer or thicker than these examination tables could not be brought to the cave, because there was a bend in the tunnel that prevented anything longer from making that turn.</p>
<p>A sweet and sour smell filled the room. A stranger might have remarked that the smell seemed like an odd combination of a &ldquo;Saturday morning fish market&rdquo; and a &ldquo;high school locker room:&rdquo; fish, smelly socks, and Lysol. The four mermaids in the room, however, had long since grown used to the smell, though an occasional wave of nausea swept through Phoebe and Emma. All four of them were hunched over one table, turning a small, lifeless mermaid over onto her stomach.</p>
<p>On the other table, a long merman&rsquo;s body stretched a few centimeters over the end of the table, the ends of his wide flukes drooping lifelessly towards the floor of the cave. A large plastic bag with Russian lettering held the majority of his internal organs, and his entire body cavity, from his face to the base of his tail, was exposed to view. On a small metal tray nearby, two thin metal spears gleamed in the blue-white light of the LED&rsquo;s, each one topped by small, pointed barb. Each tip was hollow, and the small cavities were still stained with the bluish residue of the organophosphate poison that killed Agba and Angara.</p>
<p>After they succeeded in turning Angara&rsquo;s smaller body onto her stomach, they all stretched. Agba&rsquo;s autopsy had taken most of the morning, but the mermaids had learned a great deal. After their stretch, Pat and Galina began making incisions along the sides of her dorsal ridge. Emma and Phoebe, both trying to maintain their composure and their lunch, settled in front of nearby computers, typing furiously as Pat and Galina dictated their findings to them. Several electrodes ran from Angara&rsquo;s body to Phoebe&rsquo;s computer, and data scrolled across her screen.</p>
<p>Pat stopped talking and arched her back, trying to get more comfortable, but her growing belly made the long hours at the operating table difficult. Phoebe was struggling as well, but neither wanted to stop because of the joy of pure scientific discovery. With nearly each pass of the scalpel, they were discovering new facts and possibilities about themselves and their mermaid bodies. Agba&rsquo;s lifeless body caught Pat&rsquo;s eye, and she suddenly thought that John or Gabriel would not fit on those tables. She shuddered at this unbidden thought of her pod-mate lying on that table, dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you OK? Do you want to take a break?&rdquo; Galina asked, sensing a change in her friend. &ldquo;Emma and I can certainly handle the next hour or so. Why don&rsquo;t you two take a break?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Pat said recovering, &ldquo;I was just imagining John lying there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Galina agreed. &ldquo;I had a vision of Gabriel earlier. Awful. I can only imagine what Alexis and Liga are going through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do Petra or Xing talk much about Michael?&rdquo; Phoebe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Galina said, carefully lifting the membrane that formed the barrier around Angara&rsquo;s electrical organs that lay under her dorsal ridge. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Pat warned as Galina exposed the long, thin, gray organs that ran from just below their shoulder blades all the way down to their mid-tail fins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Galina said, smiling ruefully.</p>
<p>The first time they had probed the series of three long, gray organs on Agba, Galina had gotten a nasty shock that knocked her back several feet. The lesson learned, she approached Angara&rsquo;s set of organs with greater care. Pat lifted back each section of membrane as Galania carefully avoided touching the gray organ itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that this array of nerves and cones might actually do more than create the luminescence our tails generate during sex,&rdquo; Pat observed. &ldquo;These cones in the middle are very similar to the cones found in skates and eels, and it would also explain why Agba knocked Galina down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skates can shock victims?&rdquo; Emma asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; Pat answered. &ldquo;They can generate enough electricity to stun large predators, even a human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a mermaid,&rdquo; Galina said ironically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think this organ is the same one that gives us our mer-senses?&rdquo; Emma speculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eels have three electrical organs,&rdquo; Pat said, remembering her graduate marine biology classes. &ldquo;One of which is used for electrolocation, which seems to be similar to what our mer-senses do. My guess is that our top organ, here at top of the dorsal ridge, is our mer-sense organ. Come here, and take a look.&rdquo; She pointed with a wooden probe at the small grey mass that rested on the spinal column just below the top of Angara&rsquo;s exposed dorsal ridge. &ldquo;And this middle one, don&rsquo;t touch it, Phoebe, is one that generates electricity, and the bottom one, see how it is connected right there,&rdquo; she said pointing with a wooden probe. &ldquo;May do something else or it may also generate electricity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we can tap into it some how?&rdquo; Emma said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean now?&rdquo; Galina asked. &ldquo;Do you want to get shocked too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;I mean we could try to generate electricity ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too dangerous to experiment on ourselves,&rdquo; Galina warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phoebe,&rdquo; Pat asked. &ldquo;Are you ready for me to discharge Angara&rsquo;s organ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, moving back to her computer. &ldquo;Emma, maybe we can do this same thing with ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay attention, please,&rdquo; Pat said. She waited until Phoebe nodded, and then she pushed the metal probe they had rigged into a ground wire into Angara&rsquo;s middle organ. The computer whirled and a crackle filled the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;500 watts just zapped through to the ground,&rdquo; Phoebe reported. &ldquo;That is enough to stun most anything. Wow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, wow indeed,&rdquo; Pat agreed. &ldquo;Is the current fully discharged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Phoebe said, checking her computer screen, the Cyrillic letters glowing softly on the screen. &ldquo;What I meant was, I think we can do the same experiment on ourselves with electrodes and bio-feedback programs on the computer,&rdquo; Phoebe continued. &ldquo;We can run it through the same circuit we did just now, with Angara, so that we don&rsquo;t fry the computer if we actually generate an electrical charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We already are generating an electrical charge,&rdquo; Galina observed. &ldquo;And storing it too, even after we die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Pat agreed. &ldquo;The question isn&rsquo;t how to generate the charge, but how to use it. We can&rsquo;t do those experiments now! No one should even think of trying to use your electrical charge, you could hurt yourself or others without meaning to. Remember, all we have to do is think of our child&rsquo;s eyes to become pregnant. So, no thinking! Got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thinking until AFTER we get done with these autopsies,&rdquo; Galina added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; Phoebe agreed, rubbing her lower back. &ldquo;The sooner we get done, the sooner we can rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could rest now. We&rsquo;re done with Agba,&rdquo; Galina offered. &ldquo;Emma and I can finish Angara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or we could finish more quickly together,&rdquo; Pat said with a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, just uncomfortable, but together we can finish the endocrine system, which seems to be the most complex, as far as human versus mer anatomy is concerned. We can decide on names for the two new organs we&rsquo;ve found later, and we need to finish the circulatory and lymphatic systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; Galina agreed. &ldquo;The respiratory systems seem to be identical in males and females, though we still have to name the three new organs in that system: our so-called gills, the new fibers that connect the gill fronds to the bronchial clusters in our lungs, and the vocal nodule that allows us to speak under water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could just call them gills,&rdquo; Phoebe suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No we can&rsquo;t, we are a different phyla,&rdquo; Emma teased. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re mammals, not Osteichthyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oooooh, someone has been studying her biology notes,&rdquo; Phoebe said. &ldquo;So, they aren&rsquo;t technically gills. What should we call them, Miss Smartypants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could wear pants, I would tell you,&rdquo; Emma said, sticking her tongue out at Phoebe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can decide later,&rdquo; Galina said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s finish charting the gender differences in the remaining systems. Emma, which ones are left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The muscular, skeletal, reproductive, urinary, digestive, immune, intergumentary, and nervous systems are uncharted,&rdquo; Emma said checking her list on the computer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We already did cardiovascular?&rdquo; Phoebe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oops, and cardiovascular,&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;And circulatory and lymphatic, too? Do we have to do that with Angara? This time Phoebe and I don&rsquo;t want to be the ones who have to mop up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, right,&rdquo; Phoebe agreed, turning green again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take heart, dear one,&rdquo; Pat teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Phoebe struggling to remain in control of her rebellious stomach?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because despite the mess that we are making, and which you will help clean up, we have discovered that we might be immortal,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as we don&rsquo;t get shot through a major organ, poisoned, or crushed,&rdquo; Galina said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; asked Phoebe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; Galina answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was crushed?&rdquo; Emma asked worriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Galina said. &ldquo;Yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They worked quickly, comparing what they had already charted in Agba, looking for key differences that might help them understand how and why the transformations had occurred as they had. They noted the strong cluster of nerve attachments between the lowest electrical organ and the base of spinal column, but they could not trance the function of those connections. When they had done all they could on the dorsal region, all four mers flipped Angara back over, and the autopsy continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you actually imagine all this during your transformation?&rdquo; Emma asked a few minutes later, as Pat stretched again, taking a small break from dictating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All what?&rdquo; Phoebe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these new organs, electrical sensors, generators, our nanostructured skin and scales, regenerative cells that repair all our systems, including our bones, you know &hellip; all this,&rdquo; Emma said indicating the two dead mers who were now mostly dissected, tagged, and catalogued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; Phoebe said deadpan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Emma challenged. &ldquo;Well, if you could do immortality, then why didn&rsquo;t you do magic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really want to go back to legs?&rdquo; Phoebe asked, exasperated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; she said sullenly. &ldquo;I never got much of a chance to be a girl before I became a mermaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, given how sensitive our &ldquo;siren cells&rdquo; are to bioelectrical fields,&rdquo; Galina mused as she lifted a long section of muscle away from Angara&rsquo;s re-shaped leg/tail bones. &ldquo;These mer-organs were probably created by Pat&rsquo;s and John&rsquo;s expertise in marine biology rather than Phoebe&rsquo;s imaginative efforts. So, I would bet that they are more responsible for these new organs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we save this speculation until after we get done?&rdquo; Pat chided. &ldquo;We owe Agba and Angara a decent burial, and Alexis and Liga a chance to say goodbye. Let&rsquo;s get finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric stretched his body out on the beach, enjoying the sun, and tried to catalogue all the changes he had experienced. The girls were out harvesting lunch, insisting on some mermaid-only-time. He thought back to breakfast, when Pat asked him to take his new pod over to the eastern caves. At first, he did not understand her request; he had wanted to get to know his new community a bit more thoroughly, especially John, Gabriel, and MuSu. He had so many questions. After Pat explained what was planned for that morning, he quickly agreed to go. Despite his and Sally&rsquo;s best efforts, however, both Liga and Alexis were melancholy for most of the morning. He had been torn between his concern for and responsibility to his two new pod-mates, and the simple joy and wonder he felt as he ventured out into the open sea for the first time as a merman.</p>
<p>Everything was more incredible than he ever imagined. His enhanced hearing and sight allowed him to see much further underwater than he thought possible, and his mer-senses gave him a view of the underwater world unlike anything in his previous experiences. Coral was not only red or pink or purple or yellow, it was also alive, with millions of tiny, sparkling points of life, glowing from within. Every living creature seemed to have an inner glow. According to Emma&rsquo;s brief explanation during breakfast on how his mer-senses worked, things should not really be glowing. Maybe it was how his brain processing this new sensory data as &ldquo;light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, he really didn&rsquo;t care about the scientific explanations for his new senses; the ocean was more beautiful now than ever before. Sally was more beautiful too, he thought as she surfaced several meters out, making her way ashore. Yes, she had subtly changed during her transformation, but her beauty was more than mere (or mer) physical changes. As she salamandered up the beach, he looked closely at his transformed lover. Her human half was sleeker, trimmer, and shapelier. Her hair was longer, thicker, shinier, and more beautiful, her breasts and lips were fuller, her waist was smaller, and her hips were wider. He knew that he was physically changed too, and he thrilled to the appreciative looks that Sally and the other two mermaids cast on his own body.</p>
<p>As she deposited her collection of mollusks and sea grasses nearby, he closed his eyes and remembered their first swim that morning when they entered the open water for the first time. When he focused on swimming and &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; with his mer-senses, the ocean floor was visible to him like a city seen from an airplane at night, thousands of fixed and moving points of light in different shapes and sizes marking coral reefs, fish, anemones, sea grasses, stars, turtles, and many species for which he did not know names. The brightest and clearest points of light were the three mermaids, each a cipher, not mermaid shaped, but still clearly Sally, Alexis, or Liga.</p>
<p>He could still &ldquo;see&rdquo; his mate with his eyes closed, and lifted his cheek so that she could give him a quick kiss before she waddled back into the water. He reopened his eyes and watched her shapely form disappear beneath the waves with a final flap of her beautiful blue and silver flukes. When he &ldquo;looked&rdquo; at each of his mates, he knew he wasn&rsquo;t seeing their identities, per se, but rather he was seeing a network of energies some of which were literally connected to his own body. Even now, he could see whispers of light—tiny, microscopic tendrils of energy—that constantly moved among and between the four of them. He could see them now stretching from his body across the beach towards all three mermaids, twisting and swirling as they left his body and reached out into the sea.</p>
<p>He realized that he was seeing their literal connections. Mermaid bonding was not merely emotional or spiritual, it was physical, measurable, and it was visible to his mer-senses. It was beautiful.</p>
<p>It was like being able to &ldquo;see&rdquo; love.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and &ldquo;watched&rdquo; his mates who were underwater, as they turned and slowly and gracefully started swimming towards the beach. They surfaced, laden with food. He opened his eyes and watched them waddle up onto the beach. Even Liga, who was visibly pregnant, was still a sexy mermaid, he thought as he watched her salamander towards him. He looked at all three of his mermaids, their bodies and tails undulating over the sand, and he could still &ldquo;see&rdquo; the inner glows that signaled their feelings and emotions. Earlier in the morning, when he and Sally were relatively subdued, he could only see Sally&rsquo;s glow clearly. Later, after the recent mer-widows insisted on playing together in the water so that he and Sally could get to know their new bodies, he began to see Alexis and Liga&rsquo;s inner glow more clearly.</p>
<p>He smiled as Sally handed him some oysters, remembering that morning&rsquo;s first twinkling of the sheer joy of mer-life, besides his new mates, of course. The discovery of power and strength in his new body was intoxicating. His flukes and fins responded effortlessly to his intentions, allowing him to swim with great speed and agility. Sally had been equally intoxicated, and she nearly matched him in speed and power. She made up for her smaller size with even greater agility and efficiency in her strokes and maneuvers. She was a born swimmer.</p>
<p>As they finished their lunch, Eric could see Sally&rsquo;s strong connection to him. He knew that they had something special, and that the sex was fantastic when they were human. Last night, it had been even better as mers. He looked over at Alexis and Liga and saw that they were growing more attached to both him and Sally with each passing moment. He could see their electrical patterns changing, and thin tendrils of light reaching out between him and them, fusing their bodies and souls together. He caught Alexis' eyes, and he noticed that both Alexis and Liga were now looking at him differently than they did last night or even this morning.</p>
<p>His heart actually pounded harder in his chest as he contemplated the love these mermaids were projecting towards him. He realized, at that moment, that he would lay down his own life without hesitation to protect his mates.</p>
<p>After they cleaned up the shells and bones of their lunch, the four of them lay together on the small, sandy beach. Eric&rsquo;s head was resting on Sally&rsquo;s lap, his flukes floating in the warm water as it rushed back and forth along his tail. Alexis was behind Sally, braiding Sally&rsquo;s hair, while Liga rested half in and out of the water, her head resting along Eric&rsquo;s tail, her arm draped across his mid-tail fins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you think we should head back?&rdquo; Sally asked Alexis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until dinnertime,&rdquo; she said with only the slightest hesitation. &ldquo;Autopsies take time, especially when you are doing an unfamiliar species.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem less upset than I thought you would be,&rdquo; Sally said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I now have you and Eric in my life,&rdquo; Alexis said, pulling Sally&rsquo;s braid tight. &ldquo;I thought I would die, at first, the pain seemed so great &hellip; so physical. But after last night, the hole in my heart got smaller and smaller, filling up with you two. Now, it feels almost filled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pain was physical,&rdquo; Eric said. &ldquo;I bet it felt like strings were being ripped out from your body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is exactly how it felt,&rdquo; Liga said, looking up at her new podmates. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see the strings that flow between us,&rdquo; Eric said. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by see?&rdquo; Alexis asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that I can see glowing threads of light going between us,&rdquo; Eric answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean right now?&rdquo; asked Liga.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can see them better when we are in the water,&rdquo; Eric said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see them too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Alexis answered as Liga shook her head as well. &ldquo;I can sense the presence of others, but I don&rsquo;t see anything like a thread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you, Sally?&rdquo; Eric asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can sense each of you,&rdquo; Sally answered. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see any glowing bits of light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; Eric said. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see anything now?&rdquo; Alexis asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, closing his eyes. &ldquo;But when we are out of the water, I can see only a few tendrils of light coming from each of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they look like?&rdquo; Alexis asked, all business as she finished Sally&rsquo;s braid.</p>
<p>Eric concentrated for a moment, then he opened his eyes and looked down at Liga, then up at Sally and Alexis as they loomed over his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two main threads from each of you that go into each of us, six threads total leaving our bodies,&rdquo; Eric explained as he traced a finger along a swirling thread of light out from his chest to Sally&rsquo;s chest. &ldquo;One goes to our chests and the other to our flukes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Alexis said. &ldquo;Chest to chest and fluke to fluke?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Eric answered. &ldquo;Chest threads are white, and fluke threads are a mixture of the colors of our tails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s chest threads are white?&rdquo; Alexis asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Eric answered. &ldquo;And the fluke thread leaves your tail a swirl of pink and white and about halfway to mine it mixes with my blue and silver, but our colors sometimes shoot all the way back and forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my fluke thread to Liga goes from blue and silver to black and white?&rdquo; asked Sally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Eric answered. &ldquo;But our thread is blue and silver along the entire length.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what that means,&rdquo; Alexis said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that we are connected,&rdquo; Liga said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it means we&rsquo;re connected,&rdquo; Alexis said with a smile to her sister-wife. &ldquo;But maybe those threads and colors mean more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our tails light up when we have sex,&rdquo; Liga reminded her. &ldquo;Maybe Eric&rsquo;s threads are connected to our bio-luminescence. If they are, then our luminescence is electrical, not chemical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liga!&rdquo; Alexis gushed. &ldquo;You have been learning about science. I think you may be right. Eric, do the threads look like the lights in our tails?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; Eric said, blushing, remembering their heated and repeated couplings last night. &ldquo;Last night, you guys were in charge, and I couldn&rsquo;t really see our tails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are always in charge,&rdquo; Alexis said with a smile. &ldquo;But maybe you will see our tails in greater detail shortly,&rdquo; Alexis said, kissing the back of Sally&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; Sally said, shivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you like it?&rdquo; Alexis asked, her lips moving lightly across Sally&rsquo;s soft skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Sally said, her breathing quickening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never &hellip; um &hellip; never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe those threads are why it was so painful when Agba and Angara died,&rdquo; Liga said. &ldquo;Maybe our new threads with Sally and Eric are why the pain is going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip; um &hellip;. ah &hellip; I hope you feel no pain soon,&rdquo; Sally said, smiling down at Liga, trying to ignore the feelings that Alexis' caresses were prompting. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been only a very short time, but I know that we are connected, even if I can&rsquo;t see threads. I am starting to feel things towards you and Alexis that I&rsquo;ve &hellip; um &hellip; never felt towards another woman &hellip; er &hellip; mermaid before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What feelings are those?&rdquo; Alexis asked, slowly taking Sally&rsquo;s braid back out, stroking her hair with her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; Sally said, glancing into Eric&rsquo;s face, trying to figure out what she felt. &ldquo;I think I love you just like I love Eric: emotionally, physically, everything. Does that make me a lesbian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes you a mermaid,&rdquo; Liga said. &ldquo;Sometimes I wanted only Alexis or Angara, sometimes I wanted only Agba, and sometimes I wanted all three of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just Alexis?&rdquo; Sally asked with a nervous laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does mer-sexuality frighten you?&rdquo; Alexis continued, taking one strand of Sally&rsquo;s thick hair and reaching around her sister-wife to brush the underside of Sally&rsquo;s breasts with her own hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &hellip;ooooh,&rdquo; Sally said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I stop?&rdquo; Alexis asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ah, ummmm, you can keep doing that for as long as you like,&rdquo; Sally said as she leaned back into Alexis' embrace. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s alright with you, Eric?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alexis, I order you to continue stroking Sally&rsquo;s breasts,&rdquo; Eric said smiling. &ldquo;Sally, I order you to enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not in charge,&rdquo; Alexis whispered in Sally&rsquo;s ear, pressing her own breasts against Sally&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;But I like doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This feels quick,&rdquo; Liga observed as she watched Alexis seduce their new mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too quick?&rdquo; Alexis asked, worriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Liga said, stroking Eric&rsquo;s tail with her fingernails, causing pleasant tremors to run up and down his soft, smooth, scales. &ldquo;It feels good quick. But it is quicker than before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Alexis said, as she lifted her other hand forward to cup Sally&rsquo;s other breast. &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; she pondered as Sally moaned in pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric and Sally sought us,&rdquo; Liga answered. &ldquo;Angara and Agba sought escape, and we were an accident. Our new mates wanted to be mers, and we needed new mates, so the bond was quick and good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Alexis asked as she gently pulled on Sally&rsquo;s nipple, lifting her full round breast up and away from her chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick is &hellip; aaah &hellip; good,&rdquo; she said, her breathing deepening and quickening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric is a big, fine, new mate,&rdquo; Liga said, inserting a finger into Eric&rsquo;s vent, and blowing into the pocket in which his cock was hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Eric said with a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Liga asked with a giggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I won&rsquo;t be able to control myself,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Liga said as she reached into his now open vent and helped fish out his quickly stiffening cock. &ldquo;I will control you. We like being in control, remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go right ahead,&rdquo; Eric panted as he felt her warm mouth encircle his slowly stiffening cock.</p>
<p>Sally looked down at her mate and lover, watching the dark haired mermaid stroke and suck on Eric&rsquo;s long cock. Liga was beautiful, lying in the surf, her velvet black tail shimmering in the sun, the white fringes along her fins, flukes, and dorsal ridge fluttering in the water. Liga&rsquo;s hair was a thick, lustrous cloud of black that flowed over her shoulders, down her shapely back, and draped over Eric&rsquo;s hips. Sally looked down at her own tail, so beautiful, so blue, and identical to Eric&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She stroked Eric&rsquo;s hair as he closed his eyes to enjoy what Liga was doing to him, and she could feel her own vulva swell with passion as Alexis continued to stroke her breasts. She had never had a sexual thought about a woman before, and now she wanted to touch and caress and stroke every part of both Alexis and Liga. She could feel Alexis' large breasts pushed into her gills, and her own breasts felt heavy and full with passion and mermaid milk. She shivered at the memory of the previous evening, when she had her first mermaid orgasm. She was surprised when her breasts started spurting milk into the water, and she was also surprised by the intense feelings generated by her newly enlarged breasts, ones similar to the tingles of pleasure Alexis was generating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want some desert,&rdquo; Liga said in between slurps. &ldquo;Alexis, why don&rsquo;t you give Sally some desert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea,&rdquo; Alexis said as she pulled Sally into an embrace and rolled them a few centimeters away from Liga and her prey.</p>
<p>Eric let his head fall back onto the damp sand as he felt Alexis and Sally roll away from him. He savored the warm water as it washed along his now quivering tail, cresting in small waves along his shoulders, his fins and flukes were fully extended, while the petite Filipino mermaid lavished attention upon his stiff cock. She beat it against her face, and licked it like a lollipop. Then she gave it several vigorous strokes along its entire length, and returned it to her mouth, taking nearly half of it down her throat. He knew he wouldn&rsquo;t last long.</p>
<p>Sally was equally engaged, writhing under Alexis, feeling the blond mermaid&rsquo;s soft weight pressing onto her, her tongue teasing Sally&rsquo;s now swollen and exposed clit and labia. She put her arms around Alexis' tail, reaching up to her dorsal ridge, running her fingers over the soft fringe that ran along her spine. Alexis swayed above Sally, suspended on her pelvic fins and flukes, moving her hips gently back and forth over her face. Sally gasped as Alexis' belly rubbed across her stiff nipples, and she pulled Alexis' hips down to her face, tasting the other mermaid for the first time.</p>
<p>Eric glanced over at Sally&rsquo;s gasp, and watched them grappling in the mermaid equivalent of a 69, their bodies both quivering and twitching, as their faces were buried in one another&rsquo;s vents. Even in the bright sun, he could now see the tremors of light running up and down their tails as they squirmed against one another. The flickering blue, silver, pink and white lights that shimmered along their tails were, indeed, very much like the threads of light that joined them all. Eric lifted his head and saw that both Liga and he were also luminescent, his flukes in particular were flickering and twitching, and they were beautiful.</p>
<p>He laid his head back down, savoring Liga&rsquo;s enthusiastic attention to his now throbbing cock. He turned to look again at the other mermaids and saw Sally&rsquo;s head turn away from Alexis' vent, making eye contact with him. The thread that flowed between them pulsed, and he felt a sudden orgasm rise from his mid-tail and explode into Liga&rsquo;s eager embrace. Sally&rsquo;s eyes rolled back in her head as she too, joined him in orgasm.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, and savored the long pulses of cum that splashed into Liga&rsquo;s warm mouth. He heard Alexis vocally signify that she too had joined him in this moment of bliss. When he recovered, he turned his attention to Liga. As he listened to her squeal his name as his tongue pushed her over the edge again and again, he could also feel Alexis and Sally join her in similar orgasms. When the girls recovered, Eric could see that the connection between Sally and Alexis had grown more substantial, and his own connection to Liga pulsed with greater energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can really see a difference?&rdquo; Alexis asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, stroking Liga&rsquo;s fins as she shuddered and cooed in post-orgasmic bliss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out into the water,&rdquo; Sally suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., but why?&rdquo; Eric asked. &ldquo;Liga is still recovering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because then we can do a round robin,&rdquo; Sally said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a round robin?&rdquo; Liga asked, still enjoying the fading tremors of her own orgasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We keep switching partners until each of us has made love to everyone individually,&rdquo; Sally explained, looking at Liga. &ldquo;That way, the new bonds can be built among each of us as quickly and as strongly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m recovered enough for that!&rdquo; Liga said, rolling towards the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Sally said as she splashed joyfully in pursuit of the petite mermaid, her mermaid sexuality fully awakened.</p>
<p>Eric watched the two mermaids race into the water, playfully caressing and teasing one another. Suddenly he felt the force of a mermaid tackling him from behind, rolling him into the water. Alexis pulled his face to hers and kissed him soundly as they spun into the water. He could taste Sally&rsquo;s juices on Alexis' tongue as it swirled in his mouth. As soon as there was enough water under them, she swam them both out to deeper water, propelling them down towards an underwater rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seaman Edwards, I order you to suck my nipples,&rdquo; Alexis said playfully, pulling Eric&rsquo;s face from her lips and guiding him towards her aching breasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Merman Edwards, if you please, and I&rsquo;ll only do it if I&rsquo;m ordered to enjoy it,&rdquo; he said as she thrust her stiff nipple into his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enjoy it, Edwards,&rdquo; Alexis hissed as his teeth bit down lightly on her stiff nipple.</p>
<p>Eric sucked the warm mermaid milk from Alexis; her orgasm with Sally prompted a prodigious amount of liquid. It was sweet, and he was enjoying sucking on her firm breasts. Not being in charge was going to be easy, he thought as he pulled on his vent muscle to free his quickly rebounding cock. Mermaid milk was better than Viagra.</p>
<p>They made several rounds that afternoon because someone would &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; start a new round, and then the other two would be behind an orgasm or two, but no one really seemed to mind. Later that evening, after a post-dinner round (their sixth of the day) they rested entwined around Eric, floating about five meters below the surface. Alexis belatedly remembered that they were supposed to be at a meeting of all the mers to debrief the autopsies. They rushed back to the caves, but no one chided them for being late. Although Eric alone could see the strong, thick threads of light that threaded their way through his entire pod, all the mers could see the looks on their faces, and that was excuse enough for their tardiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boat,&rdquo; Emma exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another one?&rdquo; Phoebe sighed, looking into the morning sun. &ldquo;So soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you find out?&rdquo; Pat asked, lifting herself onto the beach of the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Freedom III, from San Francisco,&rdquo; MuSu answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anyone from San Francisco,&rdquo; Sally worried, looking at Eric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from LA,&rdquo; he said, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were six people on board,&rdquo; Rikki said. &ldquo;Three men and three women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think it&rsquo;s a family,&rdquo; Cleo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That tall blond guy and the two girls are siblings, but the dark-haired boy must be a friend,&rdquo; Emma argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t spotted?&rdquo; Gabriel asked apprehensively, holding Michelle in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; MuSu answered. &ldquo;But only just barely,&rdquo; he finished with a glare at Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We needed to—&rdquo; she started to argue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relax, everyone!&rdquo; John said firmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Hank and Janice Connor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And their kids,&rdquo; Pat said with a smile. &ldquo;And the tall blond guy is probably Trevor Green, if memory serves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone blinked at Pat and John for a moment, the late morning sun beating down on the beach. After a breath or two of silence, everyone started talking and asking questions at once. It took several minutes to get all the information out and for everyone to settle back down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, these are friends of yours from Greenpeace who are looking for you?&rdquo; Petra concluded as everyone listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Pat answered. &ldquo;Though they are likely to be surprised by what they find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No kidding,&rdquo; Phoebe said in a deadpan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dark-haired boy is the girls' brother?&rdquo; Emma asked. &ldquo;No way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother or not, the boat will be here in about an hour or so, depending on the wind,&rdquo; MuSu observed. &ldquo;We need a plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>Hank nosed the Freedom III into the lagoon on the south side of 399, one of the larger islands on their possible targets list for finding his brother-in-law. Janice and the girls were at the bow, eagerly scanning the island with their binoculars, while Robbie and Trevor readied the dinghy at the stern of the boat. The noonday sun was bright and clear, the light dancing across the beach and water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are beach huts!&rdquo; Kate exclaimed, her long blonde hair swirling around her face as she pushed it away from her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Janice asked, swinging her gaze away from the volcano that rose majestically up along the western edge of the picturesque island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One-o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Ann said, joining in her sister&rsquo;s excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see them,&rdquo; Janice shouted. &ldquo;Hank, there are beach huts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who built them?&rdquo; he thought to himself, wondering if he should get his gun from the cabin below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, in the water, 11 o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Kate said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man swimming. It looks like John. No, wait, it can&rsquo;t be &hellip; but &hellip; wait &hellip; it is John, but he looks younger than I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Janice said with surprise and relief as she focused her glasses on the bobbing figure in the water. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s John, and he does look ten years younger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And more handsome,&rdquo; Ann said, quickly embarrassed that she had said it out loud. She dropped her binoculars to her side and turned to face the stern. &ldquo;For an old guy,&rdquo; she stuttered, looking at Trevor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember to tell him that when we get closer,&rdquo; Hank said with a wry smile and a nudge in Trevor&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Janice, can you hail him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;JOHN!&rdquo; Janice screamed, waving. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Janice and Hank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey sis!&rdquo; John&rsquo;s voice floated back to them over the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see you,&rdquo; she shouted back. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Patrick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat is out collecting samples on the other side of the island,&rdquo; John said, watching the boat veer towards his location.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your boat?&rdquo; Janice asked as they made more speed for the beach, now that they knew it was safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, our boat is gone,&rdquo; John said, bobbing in the wake of the sailboat as it swung into the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to your boat?&rdquo; Janice asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; John said, as the sailboat slowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trevor, radio the Sea Dancer and let them know we&rsquo;ve found John and Patrick on 399,&rdquo; Hank said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rodger,&rdquo; Trevor responded, ducking into the galley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you need a hand up into the boat?&rdquo; Janice asked as they drew with in a few meters of the still floating John. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to your eyes?&rdquo; she asked, noticing the jewel-like quality of his flashing grey/green eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s another long story, but don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll eventually hear all about it,&rdquo; John said with a smile, &ldquo;but go ahead and anchor and make landfall. Who is on The Sea Dancer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill and Mae Williams,&rdquo; Janice answered. &ldquo;You remember them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; John answered. &ldquo;Anyone else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mae&rsquo;s sister, Eve,&rdquo; Janice answered. &ldquo;And Sandy and Dawn Halbst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy and Dawn?&rdquo; asked John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s their first voyage with us,&rdquo; Janice said. &ldquo;Why all the questions? What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like I said, it&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; John grinned. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a good one. Can they be trusted to keep a secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This search for you is a secret, remember?&rdquo; Hank answered. &ldquo;Are you o.k.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; John reassured them. &ldquo;Listen, you get to the beach, and I&rsquo;ll go get Pat. It will take about thirty minutes to get back. Just remember, you need to be ready for the surprise of your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the heck do you mean by that?&rdquo; Hank asked from the stern as he swung the tiller to allow Janice to set the anchor, which she had already lowered into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; John said. &ldquo;But I warn you, it will be a big shocker. Just trust me, and don&rsquo;t shoot us. You should be on the beach when I return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot you,&rdquo; Hank said laughing, &ldquo;why on earth would we want to shoot you and Patrick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promise me?&rdquo; John said with a hint of seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, fine,&rdquo; Hank said laughing, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t shoot you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he going to make it to the other side of the island and back in thirty minutes?&rdquo; Trevor asked, scanning the length of the island.</p>
<p>Janice watched as John sank quickly below the surface, and she noticed that he looked very different under the water. She saw for the first time that his outline was much longer than she expected, and that he shot under their boat much faster than she thought a human could swim. There was also a flash of steel and blue and quicksilver along his legs as he passed beneath the boat. A sudden fear clutched at her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hank,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;John&rsquo;s changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; Hank said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been on this island for nearly two years with only Patrick for company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not strange, changed,&rdquo; Janice said, her fear building. &ldquo;He has really changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Hank asked, sensing her fear. &ldquo;Do you think the radioactivity has affected him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Janice said. &ldquo;Kate, what were the readings as we approached?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were all within normal parameters, normal background radiation,&rdquo; Kate said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t come up for air yet,&rdquo; Ann said as she scanned the lagoon in the direction in which John had headed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls, did you see anything strange about John?&rdquo; Janice asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Kate said. &ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me neither,&rdquo; Ann agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he go?&rdquo; Hank asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the boat,&rdquo; Janice answered. &ldquo;He was headed for the reef, swimming much faster than any human I&rsquo;ve ever seen swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human?&rdquo; asked Hank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked like he had a fish tail,&rdquo; Janice said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, like a mermaid?&rdquo; Hank laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, like a merman,&rdquo; Janice said.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence, only the sound of the waves lapping along the hull of their boat, and the wind rustling the sails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did say we would be shocked,&rdquo; Hank said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you arrived,&rdquo; John finished, looking across the fire to where his in-laws sat in stunned silence.</p>
<p>The mers were all arranged by pods with their backs to the water, while Hank, Janice, and Trevor sat on camp chairs on the other side of the fire. Their three children had moved among the mers, and the girls were stroking John&rsquo;s fins and flukes, while Robbie was holding Michelle who was sleeping in his arms. It had taken the rest of the afternoon and part of the evening to answer everyone&rsquo;s questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think that you&rsquo;ve become immortal?&rdquo; Janice asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not immortal,&rdquo; Pat answered. &ldquo;But the aging process has been slowed considerably, we think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve studied individual cells in all our major biological systems,&rdquo; Galina explained, &ldquo;and the regenerative properties of our new &ldquo;siren cell,&rdquo; which exists in mermaid milk and our reproductive fluids, affects all systems similarly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still not sure how it works, but it rebuilds and reshapes cells, bone, nerve, blood, DNA, everything,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;It operates like a stem cell, sort of. Rather than it becoming any other cell, it helps other cells become any other cell. Two new organs in our endocrine system make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It also made us younger. I was 56 years old before I transitioned,&rdquo; Gabriel offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he was a woman,&rdquo; Petra said, taking her mate&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;And I was nearly 60, and a male.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, there were a few steps in between before we got to being mermaids,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you all look twenty-five,&rdquo; Hank observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Siren cell,&rdquo; John said with a smile, &ldquo;I like it. Good name for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know about it John? When did you discover it?&rdquo; asked Janice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few months ago, but we didn&rsquo;t understand what it was or how it got produced until this morning,&rdquo; Pat explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, right,&rdquo; Janice said. &ldquo;The autopsies.&rdquo; Janice looked over at Eric&rsquo;s pod. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. I shouldn&rsquo;t have—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Alexis reassured her, taking Liga&rsquo;s and Sally&rsquo;s hands in hers. &ldquo;We have new mates now, and the knowledge we gained from our old mates will help us. We can bury them tonight with great dignity and honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angie?&rdquo; Janice asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angara and Agba,&rdquo; Liga answered, clear-eyed but sad. &ldquo;They were killed protecting us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is time to honor their sacrifice,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;We will post MuSu&rsquo;s pod at the entrance to the lagoon tonight, and all of us will return here in the morning. Why don&rsquo;t you get some rest in the huts, and we can talk further after some reflection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hank and Janice agreed, and watched as the mers made their way into the water. Hank returned his attention to the fire, watching the flames lick against the driftwood, the occasional spark rising into the darkness. He felt his wife&rsquo;s hand slip into his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny for your thoughts?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t enough money in the universe,&rdquo; Hank said, looking across at his children and Trevor, all of whom were eagerly waiting for his response. &ldquo;All this is just beyond me, beyond anything I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Kate began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Hank said with a sigh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s written like a neon sign on all your faces, and the answer is no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His three children erupted at once. They all wanted to stay, and they wanted to become mers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were any of you listening?&rdquo; Hank shouted, quieting them. &ldquo;First, there is some crazy drug lord who is hunting them down. Second, the US Navy will be breathing down their necks any day now. Third, the ratio is 3 females to 1male—ideally—which means that at least one male among us would need to change into a woman, and &hellip; AND,&rdquo; he raised his voice as he saw their arguments rise in their throats. &ldquo;AND, fourth, I am not going to have any kind of incestuous relationship with my own children, human or mer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone sat in silence while they did the math.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could become a mermaid to go with Janice and Hank,&rdquo; Trevor said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not related by blood to the rest of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might work,&rdquo; Robbie said hopefully. &ldquo;You could be with Dad, and I would have Kate and Ann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ewwwe,&rdquo; Kate and Ann said together. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re our brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to be a girl,&rdquo; Trevor said carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NO!&rdquo; Hank said. &ldquo;No one is going to be a girl or a mermaid. Furthermore, Robbie is NOT going to be a father to his sister&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another few moments of awkward silence passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we do?&rdquo; Janice asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but we can talk about it more in the morning,&rdquo; Hank said. &ldquo;Tomorrow is likely to be a big day, one way or the other, and we should all try to get some rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later that night, Trevor found Robbie alone on the beach, watching waves roll onto the shore in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Trevor whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t sleep?&rdquo; Trevor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Trevor said as he sat down beside the younger man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about the mermaid/girl thing,&rdquo; Robbie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mermaid/girl thing?&rdquo; Trevor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, the ‘that might work' thing?&rdquo; Robbie answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; Trevor said. He looked out at the waves for a moment or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you become a mermaid?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me; you mean become a girl?&rdquo; Robbie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; Robbie returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you first,&rdquo; Trevor said.</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a while, each lost in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Robbie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me neither,&rdquo; Trevor answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be a merman husband to my sisters, though?&rdquo; Robbie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a heartbeat,&rdquo; Trevor said good-naturedly. &ldquo;But not without your Dad&rsquo;s permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, that would be bad,&rdquo; Robbie agreed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Trevor said. &ldquo;But it would hurt, that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence again as the boys watched the sea in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be a merman husband to your sisters?&rdquo; Trevor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; Robbie said. &ldquo;I just wanted to stay and be a mer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Trevor said.</p>
<p>Trevor sat next to the younger boy in silence again. His thoughts were all a whirl. The mers were the most beautiful creatures that he had ever seen, and the grace and beauty with which all the mermaids moved, swam, and even talked was completely captivating. Their voices were like silver bells, and their laughter was like music. They were indeed sirens of the sea. He had to find a way to become a part of the mers, and it had to be sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think your dad would let me stay?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might,&rdquo; Robbie answered. &ldquo;I mean, technically you&rsquo;re not his kid, and you&rsquo;re twenty five years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s twice you&rsquo;ve said good,&rdquo; Robbie said. &ldquo;What are you hatching in that addled brain of yours?&rdquo; he asked, chucking his old friend in the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna stay,&rdquo; Trevor announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need a girl to stay, remember,&rdquo; Robbie said. &ldquo;Mermen need at least one girl or they get crazy. That&rsquo;s what Emma said. And, all the current pods are full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe one will turn up?&rdquo; Trevor said hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Robbie said, turning his gaze to the moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the hell is my daughter?&rdquo; Admiral Mackenzie &ldquo;Mac&rdquo; Bennett bellowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know sir,&rdquo; the young officer said, wishing that he were anywhere else on the planet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the fuck does that mean, I don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; His voice ringing down the long hallways of the Naval Annex. &ldquo;Call those assholes over at Homeland Security and get some answers, and then call State and see if there has been any activity on her passport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do that?&rdquo; the Lieutenant asked nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the admiral growled as he loomed over the shorter, younger man. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be busted back to Seaman so fast that pond scum will out rank you. Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye sir,&rdquo; the young man squeaked as he dashed from the Admiral&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Damn fool girl, he fumed. She was always wanting to some impulsive thing, and now she had, finally. Heck, he almost admired her for it. It showed some balls to double cross her old man that way, sneaking off with out so much as a how-do-you-do. Probably shacking up with that surfer, what was his name? Eric, damn him! Once he got his hands on that sonofabitch, he wouldn&rsquo;t have legs to stand on a surfboard.</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t he have had a son? If a son of his ran off with a pretty girl despite his objections, he might have bought the fool a cigar for finally standing up to his bluster. But a girl &hellip; girls were different! He had tried his best, after his wife had died in childbirth, to raise Sally. When she was a little girl, she adored him, but after she turned twelve, she became a creature he didn&rsquo;t understand. Damn women!</p>
<p>No, damn Eric! It had to be his fault. The Admiral picked up his phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CIA, headquarters,&rdquo; he barked into the phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill is probably about three or four weeks out,&rdquo; Hank said. &ldquo;We have to get back now, especially since we are not going to rescue anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Kate whined. &ldquo;We want to stay. We have only been here for two days, and you said we were going to be here for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plans have changed,&rdquo; Hank said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Ann chimed in. &ldquo;Is it because of that meeting you all had this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hank sighed. He struggled with how much to tell his own children about the meeting he and Janice had with Pat and John. But he couldn&rsquo;t let anyone know what they had decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going back,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do we have to go?&rdquo; Kate repeated. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re both 18!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for another two weeks,&rdquo; Hank said evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going back because you two are going to get a college education, whether you like it or not,&rdquo; Janice said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, that order to go back might not include me?&rdquo; Trevor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or me?&rdquo; Robbie added. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already got our college degrees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we want to stay and help with the gun,&rdquo; Trevor added, glancing over at Gabriel who smiled guiltily.</p>
<p>Hank glared at Gabriel who shrugged. He swung his gaze back to his son and his former intern. They were both young, strapping boys, and they could probably help a great deal. He understood their desire, but he hesitated on giving his consent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it would give you the excuse you needed to return,&rdquo; Robbie added as he watched his father struggle with his decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What excuse do I need?&rdquo; Hank growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell your friends that you need to visit me,&rdquo; Robbie said. &ldquo;Besides, I know you and Mom, and the girls. You&rsquo;ll be back; the possibility of becoming mers is too much to turn away from. Think how much we could accomplish environmentally as ambassadors from the sea, and we can only do that if there are enough of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to become a mermaid or a merman?&rdquo; Janice challenged, glaring at both Robbie and Trevor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Robbie said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not becoming mer anythings for a while. At least for a month or so, while we help with the gun and stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments passed while Hank and Janice whispered fiercely to one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying yes,&rdquo; Hank said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s not saying no,&rdquo; Janice added. &ldquo;You two can make your own decisions, but we would like you to return with us. You are right, we will be coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trevor and Robbie shared a quick glance, while his sisters squealed with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying,&rdquo; Trevor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Robbie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; Kate exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life, even a mermaid&rsquo;s life, is not always fair,&rdquo; Alexis said, offering a comforting smile to the two young girls. &ldquo;We will welcome you back when you are older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must promise to keep this a secret,&rdquo; Pat said, waddling over to them and taking their hands in hers. &ldquo;Please promise me that you&rsquo;ll not tell anyone until your father says that it&rsquo;s o.k.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We promise,&rdquo; the girls both said solemnly.</p>
<p>Hank and Janice had spent the rest of the day with all the mers in the Western Caves, except for MuSu&rsquo;s pod who kept the Connor children and Trevor company. Trevor and Robbie were given the task of replenishing the boat&rsquo;s supplies and informing the Sea Dancer of their plans. The Sea Dancer was advised to continue to 399, as John and &ldquo;Pat&rdquo; had need of some of their supplies, which is what Hank told Trevor to tell Bill, and no other details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you guys always the ones on guard duty?&rdquo; Kate asked as she stroked Emma&rsquo;s fins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re the only pod that doesn&rsquo;t have anyone in it who is pregnant,&rdquo; Emma answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Kate said. &ldquo;Do you want to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someday,&rdquo; Emma said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to get pregnant?&rdquo; Ann asked Cleo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very much,&rdquo; Cleo answered, stroking Rikki&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Ann continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we will know when it is time,&rdquo; Rikki answered. &ldquo;We agreed that we would all go together, and Emma and I are not ready. Cleo has agreed to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it like, becoming a mermaid?&rdquo; asked Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was wonderful, almost magical,&rdquo; Cleo sighed. &ldquo;I remember that it felt like my whole body had become light or energy, and that I had this incredible power in my body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was also sexy as hell,&rdquo; Rikki said. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry &hellip; you guys haven&rsquo;t, um?&rdquo; She said shifting her gaze from Trevor to the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Ann giggled. &ldquo;My father would kill us if we had sex before we got married. And Trevor is just a good friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s cute though,&rdquo; Emma observed. &ldquo;He would make a good pod-mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MuSu cleared his throat, not turning back to face the mermaids as he looked out on the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as good as MuSu, of course,&rdquo; Emma said quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, MuSu is the best of all the mermen,&rdquo; Cleo added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; Rikki said, and then giggled when he glared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did MuSu teach you to speak Chinese?&rdquo; Robbie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rikki answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, but how?&rdquo; Robbie persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Rikki answered. &ldquo;We just started talking, and he would correct us, and we slowly got better and better. Just like he learned English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just started talking?&rdquo; Robbie asked, incredulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cleo?&rdquo; Emma asked. &ldquo;What is the middle organ on an electric eel called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a biologist,&rdquo; Cleo complained, playing with Rikki&rsquo;s hair. &ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humor me,&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;Something Robbie just said. So tell me, just think, what is the name of an electric eel&rsquo;s middle electric organ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cleo shot Emma an exasperated looked and then closed her eyes to think. &ldquo;Hunter&rsquo;s Organ,&rdquo; she said guessing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it! You&rsquo;re a genius,&rdquo; Emma said, offering Robbie a high five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Cleo? &ldquo;What just happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew,&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you, but I only learned it yesterday, and you knew it too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big deal about that?&rdquo; Cleo asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, I know some stuff too,&rdquo; Rikki said. &ldquo;You still don&rsquo;t know what our third organ does, do you?&rdquo; Emma shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat must have told us those names,&rdquo; Cleo said. &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t remember it from the meeting a few days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Emma said, growing more excited. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say any names because she said that we need to come up with new names: mer names. She only said that we have eight new organs that don&rsquo;t exist in human anatomy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, how did Cleo know the name of that organ?&rdquo; Rikki asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because we are connected, we are a pod,&rdquo; Emma answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we learn languages so fast, and why we know how each of us are feeling, and all that. We learn via our connections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, we could learn everything someone else knew if we were pod-mates with them?&rdquo; Ann asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I think so,&rdquo; Emma answered. &ldquo;But we all learn a little bit from other pods, not just our mates, though those learning links are not as strong as our own. We&rsquo;ve just never discovered that the pod learning may be unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unconscious?&rdquo; Ann asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cleo knew the name of the organ without being actually told, and she doesn&rsquo;t care much for science,&rdquo; Robbie concluded. &ldquo;But you actually like science, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Phoebe and I are the only young mermaids who really like science, and we are always learning new stuff from Pat, Galina, and Alexis. But everyone, even Cleo, knows a lot about marine biology, what stuff to eat, and stuff like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know stuff about Russian literature,&rdquo; Cleo sniffed. &ldquo;I actually like talking to Galina about that stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is pretty international here,&rdquo; Emma agreed. &ldquo;We all have learned stuff about America, China, Thailand, the Philippines, Russia, all kinds of places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you teach everyone about Australia,&rdquo; MuSu offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Ann said. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t have to go to college! We could stay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, you might,&rdquo; Emma agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can get your father to agree,&rdquo; Trevor cautioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emma, can I ask you a question?&rdquo; Robbie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, not here, can we go for a walk or a swim?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She looked at MuSu, who nodded his assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, let&rsquo;s go for a swim,&rdquo; she suggested, as the two of them headed for the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what that is all about?&rdquo; Rikki asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he gets mysterious every now and again,&rdquo; Ann said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s usually nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; Kate agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just his artistic side showing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo; Pat shouted out to the boat as it pushed its way out into the open sea. Her head and shoulders bobbed in the warm lagoon as she waved vigorously. &ldquo;We will take good care of Robbie and Trevor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; Janice called back.</p>
<p>Pat watched the boat for another few minutes, savoring the water as it supported her body, her fins gently twirling in the water to keep her in place. Danni and Phoebe were on her flanks, and John was below, brushing among all three of their tails. Liga, Petra, and Xing also bobbed in the water nearby. Liga was feeling &ldquo;very pregnant,&rdquo; as she explained to anyone who would listen. Xing was just as pregnant, the two of them having conceived on the same day, but she seemed much more comfortable than Liga. Petra was trying to keep Michelle entertained as the little mermaid swam and splashed all around her mother. All the rest of the mers were leaping and playing alongside the sailboat, as it made its way out into the sea.</p>
<p>Pat smiled to herself as she saw Kate and Ann finally laugh at MuSu, who had been putting on an extraordinary display with his own pod-mates. She knew Kate and Ann were deeply disappointed that Hank had insisted that they leave, but she also knew, though they did not, that they would be back much sooner than the girls expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back and see if the new sled works,&rdquo; Pat suggested. &ldquo;I know that Trevor and Robbie want to join us as mers as quickly as possible, and so we need to get that gun working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who would become the girl?&rdquo; Liga asked. &ldquo;We are all full, and we don&rsquo;t want to make room like we did for Eric and Sally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Pat agreed. &ldquo;Either they will work that one out themselves, or some others will show up in the mean time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hopefully not the US Navy,&rdquo; Petra said, scooping her daughter up into her arms, kissing her on her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of which, let&rsquo;s get back and work on that sled,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>All the mermaids nodded and they all flipped back beneath the waves, John assuming the lead as they swam in an extended mer-diamond formation. As Pat settled into her position behind John&rsquo;s right pelvic fin, she sensed Petra and Michelle fall in behind her own pelvic fin, while Xing got behind Danni who was on John&rsquo;s other flank. Phoebe and Liga took the bottom diamond spots behind Danni and Pat, and they all fell into a shared rhythm that sped them back towards the caves.</p>
<p>It felt good to be swimming, Pat decided, watching the sleek forms slicing through the water around her. Her belly was beginning to show, now that she was nearly ten months pregnant, but swimming helped her cope with the feelings of fullness and pressure from within. Poor little Liga was only one day less pregnant than she was, but her belly was showing almost as much as Petra&rsquo;s had in her eleventh month. Pat closed her eyes and reached out with her mer-senses. Liga was fine, if a bit tired, nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Manalo stood before his father, his eyes fixed confidently on Malaki&rsquo;s face. Few men stood before the diminutive crime boss with such confidence, but Manalo was Malaki&rsquo;s son. Behind him, he could hear Miss Chin nervously assembling papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have put our agents in Fiji on the track,&rdquo; Manalo reported. &ldquo;We should hear back in a month or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not soon enough,&rdquo; Malaki said, twirling a ring on his finger, the only outward sign of his impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will fly to Suva to see if special attention can speed things up,&rdquo; Manalo offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acceptable,&rdquo; Malaki said, forming a plan in his head. &ldquo;Take Miss Chin with you as your personal assistant. She may be useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Manalo said, not wanting to smile. She would be most useful indeed. She knew nearly every aspect of his father&rsquo;s empire, and she could fill in a few holes in his own knowledge. His father didn&rsquo;t keep things from him on purpose, he knew, but knowledge was power. Power was protection, and only a fool would completely trust his father. He was determined to show him that his father had not raised a fool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make regular reports,&rdquo; Malaki said, dismissing them as he turned in his chair to face the large window that looked out over the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Manalo said with a smile at Miss Chin. &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; he ordered, smiling broadly as he strode from the office. Miss Chin would also be useful because Manalo had been waiting for nearly two years to seduce the pretty, young secretary. He had been the one to kidnap her sister, Lin, and forced her into prostitution. Lin was a very responsive lover, even in her drugged state. Now, he would have the younger sister too, and then move her into the brothel with her sister after this mission was over. His father would approve.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, the boys were washing off the grime and dirt of the jungle, finally finished with their task of helping to set up the gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did they say the test firing would go off?&rdquo; Trevor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noon,&rdquo; Robbie answered, relaxing in the lagoon&rsquo;s warm water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we should get up to the hot tub,&rdquo; Trevor suggested, rising from the water and walking towards the beach.</p>
<p>Using the sled harvested from Tumibay and the new one they had assembled themselves, the mers had successfully freed the 130 mm forward gun from the Russian submarine. According to the materials harvested from the captain&rsquo;s quarters, the gun was experimental, designed to be detached from the sub and put on a remote beachhead, fully automated, and remotely operated. It used solar power to store energy for its servos and hydraulic systems. It was perfect for the mers, but it was heavy. However, by using the ancient technologies of fulcrums, logs, and ropes, the mers and the boys were able to lift it above the rocky coves on the eastern edge of the island.</p>
<p>Once they deployed the gun&rsquo;s self-stabilizing mechanical arms, Trevor and Robbie ran cables from one of the listening holes near the western caves over to the gun&rsquo;s location. Closer listening holes on the eastern edge of the island had proved impossible to thread through the rock itself. They also strung cables up from the Moon Pool Chimney to a rock outcropping near the summit of the volcano and mounted the targeting platform. Alexis explained that it too was an experimental design, very small, but very powerful. It could look over the horizon, further than the gun&rsquo;s range of 30 kilometers (18 miles). Best of all, it used solar power arrays, which also helped power the gun&rsquo;s control systems, ones that demanded more power than the fuel cells could give. The boys were also the primary laborers in the effort to camouflage both the gun and the radar unit.</p>
<p>Now finished and hopefully operational, MuSu&rsquo;s pod towed Eric and Sally&rsquo;s ancient fishing boat out to sea, where it was now drifting about 10 kilometers south of the island. If all went well, it would be at the bottom of the sea within the hour.</p>
<p>Robbie rose from the water and headed for the beach. He and Trevor had worked hard, and both their bodies were bronzed by the sun and hardened by their work. But Robbie had worked three times as hard as Trevor, and he had gained significant weight and muscle in the past few weeks. He glanced at Trevor&rsquo;s back, and judged that he now weighed almost as much as Trevor did, finally. The plan he had formulated several weeks ago was now coming to fruition. Both he and Trevor were anxious to become mers, but up until now, Trevor had a discernable advantage in height and weight. The gap was much closer now, and Robbie felt confident he could overpower Trevor when it came time. He followed Trevor into the jungle, and up to the mountainside hot tub where they had been asked to observe the test firing of the new gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the boat,&rdquo; Galina said, pointing at a small blip of boat-shaped light on the computer screen. &ldquo;This new pulse technology works much better than the old radar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can almost see the shape of that boat,&rdquo; Gabriel remarked, impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Yuri who designed the technology,&rdquo; Alexis said, remembering an old colleague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I remember him,&rdquo; Galina said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad he died. He would have loved to be a merman. He was navy from when he was ten years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is everyone set?&rdquo; Pat asked Emma, who was floating in the small pool that marked the entrance to the lab cave.</p>
<p>Emma ducked below the water and sent out a vocal pulse that echoed down the tunnel. A few minutes later, Rikki emerged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone is set,&rdquo; she reported. &ldquo;Everyone but us is in the Moon Pool, and MuSu and Cleo are in the listening cave. They report that both boys are in the hot tub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriel, any chance I can talk you out of this?&rdquo; Pat asked. &ldquo;What if the flash is registered by the European or Russian EOS systems?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be hard to discern in the sunlight, and we aren&rsquo;t going to rely on the gun,&rdquo; Gabriel argued. &ldquo;But we need to know that it works if we are to have any position to negotiate with aggressors. Remember, the most useful weapon is one that is never used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just had to try—&rdquo; Pat began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know,&rdquo; John said, bringing her into an embrace. &ldquo;But it will change what we can do if we are threatened. I would rather swim into a torpedo tube myself, if I thought I could protect you and our children. Hopefully, we will never have to use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat nodded, and closed her eyes. Gabriel turned to Galina and nodded. Galina&rsquo;s fingers typed a few quick commands into her computer, and seconds later they heard a distant thump. A few seconds more, and the blip on their computer screen disappeared.</p>
<p>Trevor hadn&rsquo;t meant to violate anyone&rsquo;s privacy, but he could not turn away from the sight below him. After the successful test-firing, he volunteered to check the gun for any damage or changes to the camouflage caused by the firing, but really it was a change to be alone, to think. He wanted to be away from everyone, but most especially Robbie. They had argued while they waited in the hot tub for the gun to fire. If it worked, Robbie reminded him, they could become mers. But, because all the pods were &ldquo;full,&rdquo; one of them would have to become a mermaid. Neither would volunteer to become the girl, and Robbie had suggested a wrestling match to decide who would become the mermaid.</p>
<p>Trevor could not agree to the contest. After all, what if he lost? Even though he knew that he was taller and heavier than Robbie, he didn&rsquo;t think it would be an easy win. Robbie was strong, quick, and agile, and he had been working like a madman for the past three weeks. Trevor was smart enough to see that Robbie had been planning this challenge the entire time. Despite his fears, he could think of little else than the prospect of becoming a mer, even a mermaid.</p>
<p>The sight he saw below was now amplifying his internal struggles. MuSu&rsquo;s pod was frolicking on the beach, the three identical girls laughing and giggling as they rolled and played in the surf with MuSu. One of the girls, it was impossible to tell them apart if you weren&rsquo;t a mer, pinned MuSu&rsquo;s arms to the sand while she ground her body along his, their tails erotically entwined. One of the other two girls pinned the other girl to the sand in a similar manner, rubbing their bodies together, and kissing. Trevor watched transfixed as the mers began to make love in the shallow water.</p>
<p>The mermaid over MuSu lifted her head to the sky and moaned loudly as she impaled herself on MuSu&rsquo;s cock. MuSu grabbed her shapely hips just below her pelvic fins, and began lifting her up and down, their flukes splashing in the water. Trevor could see her breasts jostle with each thrust of her body down onto MuSu, her arms rested on his chest, as she held herself erect. He could see the other two girls lying next to each other, their hands buried in each other&rsquo;s vents as they kissed and nipped one another&rsquo;s faces, shoulders, and breasts.</p>
<p>Trevor suddenly discovered that his hard cock was in his hand, and that his shorts were around his ankles. As he stroked his cock, he wondered what it would be like to be a mermaid. Everyone on the beach seemed to be having an equal amount of fun. Suddenly, the mermaid over MuSu cried out, and milk began to spurt from her breasts, her entire body quaking with the force of her orgasm. MuSu roared out as he too erupted in an equally impressive orgasm, pulling the mermaid&rsquo;s hips to his, keeping his cock buried deep within her as she shivered and quaked above him. Their tails flashed with luminescent strands of blue, yellow, and white as their orgasms rolled through their bodies. Trevor felt his own orgasm rise quickly, and he stifled a moan as he shot his semen onto the rocks behind which he was hiding.</p>
<p>As he recovered his wits, he reassessed Robbie&rsquo;s proposal. Both of them wanted to become mers, and neither wanted to wait. The thought of changing was intoxicating, and it filled nearly every daydream and fantasy he had. One of those three mermaids was Emma, and she used to be a boy. In fact, as he thought about it, ten of the sixteen current mers (not counting little Michelle) had been born the opposite sex they currently enjoyed. None of the changed mers seemed to be complaining.</p>
<p>His own penis was still pulsing in his hand, and he shook it off, and stuffed it back into his pants. He realized that the risk of becoming the mermaid wasn&rsquo;t as scary as he originally thought when Robbie first approached him. In fact, it was exciting. Oh, he was confident that he could pin his old friend, and if Robbie was willing to risk becoming a girl, he could risk it too.</p>
<p>It would be fun.</p>
<p>Mac Bennett looked again at the reports on his desk. One detailed how Sally and Eric had flown to Fiji, bought a boat, and were somewhere in the South Pacific. The other was a routine report that all upper level officers received that showed changes in classifications to the world&rsquo;s oceans. Quite by accident, the admiral himself had noticed that a new classified location had been declared a few hundred miles northwest of Fiji. When he probed further, he discovered that the Blackgate protocol had been used; a procedure that rendered a twenty nautical mile arc of the South Pacific classified and wiped out all files on the various islands and atolls within that area.</p>
<p>As much as he didn&rsquo;t want to believe his own eyes, he could not ignore the coincidence. Did Sally herself initiate the Blackgate, or did someone else? If she did, why did she? The boat they bought might make it to the classified area, but it would not make it back. How much attention did he want to bring to himself and his daughter? The Blackgate protocol was difficult to trace, but it was possible. It only depended on how much trouble you wanted to stir up.</p>
<p>He stood and walked to the window that overlooked the Potomac. He crossed his arms and sighed. She and Eric were there; he knew that with a sad certainty. But why? Why would his daughter or someone else designate a small section of the South Pacific as a Blackgate area before she went there? If it had been a legitimate terrorist threat, he felt sure she would not betray her country or her father. He felt even more confident that if Sally knew about the Blackgate or did it herself, she would not go off with that surfer to save the world from a dangerous threat.</p>
<p>Even if this wasn&rsquo;t a traitorous act, this was still more than an impulsive trip with a handsome young surfer. Something was going on, something that Sally or someone else didn&rsquo;t want him to know. He was sure of that, at least. Sally&rsquo;s disappearance and the new Blackgate were linked, and he was the target. It might not be dangerous, but it might be embarrassing for him and his career to have a daughter, his only daughter, jeopardize national security for some romantic whim just to get away from his overbearing control and influence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Blackgate protocol was rarely invoked, and the paperwork would eventually surface that explained why it had been used. He had the security clearances needed to see the report. There was still a chance that it was something else, possibly treason or terrorism, and that his daughter was involved. But whom could he trust? How could he continue this investigation before alerting other prying eyes?</p>
<p>He returned to his desk, and picked up the phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dawkins, get me Joy Simpson on the phone,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Joy Simpson had retired from the CIA two years ago, and she had been a friend since his wife died. In fact, his wife had introduced them, but after her death, their careers had prevented them from becoming something other than friends. Joy had been close to Sally as well, though not enough to help with her hellion stage as young teen. Most importantly, however, was that Joy was based in Hong Kong, and still lived there after her retirement.</p>
<p>His phone buzzed. &ldquo;Ms. Simpson on the line, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; he answered gruffly. &ldquo;This is Mackenzie Bennett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mac,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;To what do I owe this great surprise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to do what?&rdquo; John asked. &ldquo;You mother will kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We both want to be mers, and we don&rsquo;t want to wait,&rdquo; Robbie explained. &ldquo;But neither one of us wants to be a girl. This way it will be fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have agreed to this foolishness?&rdquo; John asked Trevor, who nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you do realize that size and strength are major factors in determining who gets changed?&rdquo; Pat asked. &ldquo;You are slightly smaller than Trevor, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Robbie said nervously, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m faster and smarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about smarter,&rdquo; John said. &ldquo;Your parents will be back in a few months, maybe sooner. Why can&rsquo;t you just wait until then? We have actually planned for your transition, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Robbie said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of everyone planning things for me, and I don&rsquo;t want to wait. Now that the gun is done, there is nothing to do. I don&rsquo;t want to just sit around, waiting for two or three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me neither,&rdquo; Trevor added. &ldquo;Besides, the risk is exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so risky about being a mermaid?&rdquo; Galina asked with a warning glance. &ldquo;There is nothing bad about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! That is more or less what Robbie and I said this morning,&rdquo; Trevor said, backpedaling. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a bad thing, but neither one of us wants to &ldquo;choose&rdquo; to become the mermaid. We would rather let fate or luck do that work for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one of you will become a girl,&rdquo; Pat warned. &ldquo;Now that our mermaid milk is more powerful, the change will be quick, perhaps in only a few minutes once you start down this path. One slip could mean the difference between male or female.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are telling me that being a female is a bad thing?&rdquo; Trevor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;I just want to make sure both of you have thought this through. Robbie&rsquo;s parents are recruiting a pod for each of you, or at least that was the plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Robbie said. &ldquo;I would rather be with Trevor, who has been a good friend for many years, than with some of the Greenpeace activists I suspect that they are recruiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, can we do it?&rdquo; Trevor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is possible,&rdquo; Pat answered. &ldquo;Even if it isn&rsquo;t advisable. If you had a few feedings and then went off to fight it out, one of you would begin to change into a woman. You could come back to the Moon Pool and finish the transition into mers, or you could wait until the change to a woman was complete, and then change to mers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably don&rsquo;t want to wait too long after determining who is the girl before changing to mers,&rdquo; Galina warned. &ldquo;We know that organisms continue to develop in the absence of the electromagnetic fields we generate in the Moon Pool. If you wait too long, you might start changing into something else entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long would be dangerous?&rdquo; Robbie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With just normal mermaid milk, about thirty-six hours,&rdquo; Pat answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something else?&rdquo; Trevor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s on a need to know basis,&rdquo; Pat answered tersely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no problem,&rdquo; Trevor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, we don&rsquo;t need to know yet. I think that we want to spend the night sorting things out, and we will change to mers the next day,&rdquo; Robbie suggested, and Trevor nodded.</p>
<p>Manalo looked out on the beach, watching Shen Chin walk back from the ocean. She was stunning in her bikini, her perfectly proportioned figure swaying back and forth as she trailed her towel behind her. He lounged on the bed of the exclusive beachside hotel, and marveled at the last few weeks. Shen nearly raped him when they first arrived at the hotel. He thought he would be raping her, but she practically ripped her own clothes off and then went after his the moment the door closed.</p>
<p>The sex was fantastic, even better than her older sister. Shen was also a more vocal lover, and Manalo had been rung dry by her apparently insatiable appetite. As she walked into the room, she gave him a smile that curled his toes and stiffened his penis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you are finally awake,&rdquo; she purred as she untied the knot behind her neck. She pulled the top free and pushed her small breasts together. &ldquo;You ready for breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Manalo said, still not believing his luck. &ldquo;But we have to get to the consulate by ten this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only eight,&rdquo; she said, pushing down her bottoms, revealing the small arrow of hair above a pair of slightly swollen lips. &ldquo;We have plenty of time,&rdquo; she said as she crawled seductively onto the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father has no idea what he is missing,&rdquo; he said as she grabbed his stiff cock and pointed it at her vagina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do you,&rdquo; thought Shen Chin to herself as she impaled herself on the easily manipulated young man. She was almost ready to put her plan into action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now remember, our milk is more potent than it used to be, so be ready,&rdquo; Galina advised as she handed Trevor two canteens. &ldquo;This one is mermaid milk, and this one is a mix of mermaid milk and merman semen. Once one of you starts to change, the other one should finish the rest of the milk while the one who is changing should drink the mix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to Pat&rsquo;s calculations, the first change should be noticeable in only a few minutes,&rdquo; Petra said, holding Michelle to her breast, which had only moments ago fed Robbie. &ldquo;Once you drink the mixed canteen, the change into a full fledged woman should only take less than an hour. You can even speed that up to only a few minutes by—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Robbie interrupted. &ldquo;We know how to speed the change along.&rdquo; Both he and Trevor blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck, and we&rsquo;ll see you tomorrow morning,&rdquo; Gabriel said.</p>
<p>Robbie and Trevor watched Gabriel&rsquo;s pod return to the water. The boys had their first feedings from Pat and Danni that morning, and they could both feel the milk coursing through their bodies, and so they avoided one another and stayed with a mermaid to keep their maleness potent. A second feeding at mid-day with MuSu&rsquo;s girls had raised the power of the milk, and they both felt power throbbing within them. The third feeding at dinner with Petra and Galina had lifted that power to a fever pitch. John had warned them about the aggression they might feel, but neither boy felt overly aggressive or angry. They both felt nervous, and excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; Trevor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best two out of three?&rdquo; Robbie joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once we start, there&rsquo;s no going back,&rdquo; Trevor said. &ldquo;The first change is not reversible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except in the case of a pod losing its male,&rdquo; Robbie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And neither one of us want that,&rdquo; Trevor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You nervous?&rdquo; Robbie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; Robbie said. &ldquo;You ready to be more than just friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Trevor said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both walked up the beach onto a clear area of sand and stripped out of their swimsuits. Naked, they faced each other, both of their cocks at half-mast, the sexual tension throbbing even as they both faced the possibility that one of them would lose that cock shortly. They circled around one another, pacing in the sand. Robbie suddenly charged, and Trevor dodged him easily. They resumed circling, feeling the power of the milk course through their bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make a very tall woman,&rdquo; Robbie said, &ldquo;like my sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to pin me first,&rdquo; Trevor said, circling like a tiger. &ldquo;What will your new female name be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robbie ran at him again, catching him in the chest, and they both tumbled to the sand. Robbie pressed his arm into Trevor&rsquo;s throat, trying to pin him down while he pushed his torso on top of Trevor&rsquo;s. He could feel Trevor&rsquo;s erection pressing into his own, and he looked into Trevor&rsquo;s eyes and saw the panic in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will yours be?&rdquo; Robbie asked.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Trevor heaved his entire body into the air, and threw Robbie off of him. Robbie rolled away as Trevor scrambled to catch him, but he sprang clear of Trevor&rsquo;s reach. The two men resumed circling one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna have to hold me down longer than that,&rdquo; Trevor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; Robbie said as he charged again.</p>
<p>Trevor didn&rsquo;t dodge this time, and instead stuck out a foot. Robbie went down with a thud into the sand, face first. Trevor landed on him with a thump. Robbie clawed at the sand, trying to get out from under Trevor, but the larger man had him pinned. Robbie continued to struggle, twisting and clawing at the sand. Trevor stayed on top of him, their sweaty bodies grinding into the sand. He grabbed one of Robbie&rsquo;s ankles and brought it up to his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noooooo!&rdquo; Robbie screamed, as he suddenly felt the energy in his body change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, buddy,&rdquo; Trevor said softly, even as he felt his own body respond to the change in power between the two of them. &ldquo;You get to be the mermaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robbie continued to struggle, even as he felt the effects of Trevor&rsquo;s weight on his back seep into his body. He could feel his energy draining, the milk beginning to do its work on his body. With each passing second, his efforts to escape grew less and less, until finally he stopped moving. He panted into the sand, feeling Trevor&rsquo;s powerful weight pressing into his back, his knee throbbing where Trevor had stretched it back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me up,&rdquo; Robbie gasped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over. You won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Trevor said as he lifted himself up, noticing that he had changed a little bit already. His chest was broader and deeper, and his cock was larger. It now bounced before him, arching at least eight inches into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Robbie said as he turned over, brushing sand from his body. &ldquo;We both took the same chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down at himself, and both men could see the changes already working on both their bodies. Robbie&rsquo;s hair was already longer, and there was the slightest flair to his hips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this over with as soon as possible,&rdquo; Robbie said, reaching for the canteens. &ldquo;Which one is mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one on the left,&rdquo; Trevor said, watching Robbie with fascination as the younger man seemed to be handling his loss with a lot of class.</p>
<p>Robbie handed the other canteen to Trevor and opened the top on his. He sniffed the contents. &ldquo;Oh, yea,&rdquo; he muttered making a face, &ldquo;this one is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trevor opened his canteen and smelled the same sweetness he had enjoyed from his previous feedings. &ldquo;Well, cheers,&rdquo; he said nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bottoms up,&rdquo; Robbie said, holding Trevor&rsquo;s gaze as he downed the contents of the canteen.</p>
<p>Robbie could feel the warm mix of milk and semen as it cascaded down his throat, creating a pleasant burning in his belly. It didn&rsquo;t taste as bad as it smelled, he decided. As he held Trevor&rsquo;s gaze in his own, he knew that he was putting up a good front, but secretly Robbie was excited by the prospect of changing into a woman. He couldn&rsquo;t have volunteered to do so, but the fight had been a fair one, and he might have won it. Now, the cards had been played, and Robbie was going to play the game for all it was worth.</p>
<p>Robbie set the empty canteen on the sand, and watched as Trevor finished his. Robbie examined the young man in a way he had never allowed himself to do before. Trevor&rsquo;s blonde hair and blue eyes were actually quite attractive, and he now understood why his sisters had gone on and on over how cute Trevor was. His shoulders had broadened, thanks to the siren cells that were making his own shrink, and his hips had narrowed, even as Robbie&rsquo;s own had widened. When Trevor finished his canteen, he gave Robbie a sheepish smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what, Robbie?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, it will be Rose,&rdquo; Robbie stated. &ldquo;Second of all, let&rsquo;s get into the water. My bones already ache, and Emma said it would help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did Emma tell you that?&rdquo; Trevor asked, extending his hand down to Robbie/Rose to help him get up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before my parents left,&rdquo; Rose said. &ldquo;I asked her what the change was like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; Trevor asked as he headed for the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She only wished that she had been a girl for longer than a few minutes,&rdquo; Rose said, easing herself into the warm water, pushing her hair from her face. &ldquo;This water feels wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you suggested that we spend the night,&rdquo; Trevor said gaining understanding. &ldquo;You want to spend the night as a girl before you become a mermaid. Why you little minx!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Rose said. &ldquo;But if you come over here and kiss me, you can make me your little minx a lot more quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re ready for this?&rdquo; Trevor asked as he wadded over to where Rose was floating in the water, and sat down in on the sandy bottom.</p>
<p>The water was shallow, less than a meter, and Rose floated into Trevor&rsquo;s lap, resting her slowly but visibly changing head on his lap. &ldquo;Will you please kiss me?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I can feel the changes, but they are slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trevor looked down at Rose&rsquo;s body and saw that her hips and waist were slightly female, and that Robbie&rsquo;s cock had shrunk, but was still hard and pointing into the air. He looked down into Robbie&rsquo;s dark brown eyes, and smiled. Rose was already visible in his face, and his features softer and smaller. Trevor leaned down and kissed him.</p>
<p>Rose, as she repeated to herself inside her head, pulled Trevor into the kiss, feeling his/her mouth press into his as she thrust her tongue into his mouth. If she was going to become a mermaid, she was going to be the prettiest and sexiest one possible. She could feel the power of Trevor&rsquo;s presence loom over her, his body cradling her as she changed. Her hips and shoulders ached as they stretched or shrank, but she focused her efforts on becoming Trevor&rsquo;s perfect woman. They kissed for several minutes, holding and caressing one another as both continued to change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest time,&rdquo; Rose breathed, trying to catch her breath. Between the power of the milk and the power of Trevor&rsquo;s kisses, her head was spinning. She closed her eyes and catalogued what was happening to her. Her body ached everywhere, and she could tell she was losing mass. Her hair was growing at an astounding rate, and her insides felt like jelly. After a few minutes of trying to catch her breath, she reached back up and pulled Trevor into another kiss.</p>
<p>Trevor felt Rose meld her changing lips over his and her tongue swirled around his lips and teeth, dueling with his own tongue. Her hands gripped his head, and he put his arms around her, pulling her torso to his. He could feel two small bumps on her shrinking chest, and the slope of her waist away from her ribs. He ran his hands down her back, feeling the dimples above the soft swell of her expanding ass. His own erection throbbed almost painfully, and it brushed her sides as she twisted in his embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, those were some kisses,&rdquo; she breathed, feeling the passion and power of the mermaid fluids flow through her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your eyes have changed,&rdquo; Trevor said, holding her face in his hands, her quickly growing hair floating in the water around her like a halo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were brown, but now they are the most beautiful violet eyes that I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; Trevor said. &ldquo;And your hair is darker, almost black. You look like a young Elizabeth Taylor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? Is that your dream girl?&rdquo; Rose asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was,&rdquo; Trevor answered. &ldquo;You remember that I have always liked those old movies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rose said smiling, her face lighting up in a way never before possible. &ldquo;My art movies and your old movies, and my sisters never like either one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about me?&rdquo; Trevor asked. &ldquo;Am I changing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; Rose said, looking. &ldquo;Still blond, blue-eyed, and gorgeous, though I never really noticed that last one before today. Your shoulders are wider, and your muscles are more defined. You&rsquo;re supposed to be focusing on changing me. God, kiss me again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kissed feverishly, mashing their mouths together, each trying to taste the other. Trevor focused his energies on her for the first time, willing her to become the girl of his dreams. After a few minutes of kissing, Rose pulled back and groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip; big push,&rdquo; she gasped as her hips widened yet again. She put a hand to her abdomen and grunted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all mush in there, all pushing and pulling and twisting. I can feel everything changing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; asked Trevor. &ldquo;Is there anything I can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she whispered, feeling the power of the milk pulse in her belly. Then she remembered Petra&rsquo;s advice from earlier. &ldquo;Yes, wait, there is something you can do. Move further towards the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still holding her in his arms, Trevor used his legs to push them further towards shallow water. When he reached the point where his butt hit the sand and his cock extended from the water, she stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie back,&rdquo; she said, keeping her hips in slightly deeper water, floating next to his legs. &ldquo;Focus on what you want me to become,&rdquo; she said, as she put her face even with Trevor&rsquo;s expanded cock and reached for it with her left hand.</p>
<p>As she touched it, she felt a spark of electricity flow between them. She wondered if it was from his brain or his body, but it flowed through her body, sending tendrils of pleasure up and down her limbs. She focused on the penis she now held in her hand, the first one other than her own that she had ever grasped. It felt hard and soft at the same time, much bigger than her own had once been. She stroked it a few times, feeling Trevor&rsquo;s abdomen tense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petra did say it would speed things up,&rdquo; Rose said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are pretty speedy if you ask me,&rdquo; Trevor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you saying that you don&rsquo;t want me to suck on your cock?&rdquo; she asked coyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No man in the world would ever deny such a pretty lady the opportunity to suck on his dick,&rdquo; he said with eager anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just checking,&rdquo; she said, and slipped the crown into her mouth.</p>
<p>It felt warm, warmer than she expected, and it tasted slightly of salt water. It was a clean taste, however, and she decided she liked it. She began to bob her head up and down, stroking the length with her hand, feeling her wet hair, still growing, hanging down around her. She pushed her hair away from her face and resumed stroking his cock, feeling the blood pound within its shaft. She could feel her body changing, responding to Trevor&rsquo;s touch, his smell, and his presence. Now that her bones were nearly done, she ached less and felt more pleasure. A twinge of stronger pleasure signaled that her growing vagina was nearly done. She could also feel the beginnings of her breasts hanging from her chest, bobbing with the motions of her head. She focused all her energies on becoming that a girl, a complete woman, Trevor&rsquo;s mate.</p>
<p>Trevor looked down at the beautiful creature that was giving him the blowjob of his life. Her hair hung down over her shoulders, and the small cones of her new breasts jutted from her small and slender rib cage. Her left hip rose from the water near his knees; her waist below the surface of the water. There was very little of Robbie left, only Rose, and only in a matter of minutes. He could feel her legs wrap around his, her shorter and smaller feet caressing his. He could feel his orgasm rise up quickly, and he groaned as he spurted into her mouth.</p>
<p>Rose felt his cock swell in her hand and pressed her lips around his cock, eager for proof of her power over him. She savored the salty musky semen as it pulsed in her mouth. After Trevor finished, she kept him in her mouth, sucking softly as his cock deflated slightly. She could feel her breasts finally, becoming heavy and full, pressing into Trevor&rsquo;s hip as she sucked on his lovely cock. They felt huge, and she could feel her newly enlarged nipples stiffening as she rubbed her chest on his hip.</p>
<p>She shifted in the water, swinging her wide hips over his legs, letting her breasts fall on his thighs, as she continued to suck on his cock. She threaded one of her legs through his and pressed her crotch into his knee. Her new vagina ached with need, and she pressed her cleft into his kneecap, rocking her hips back and forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing now?&rdquo; Trevor asked, feeling her hotness pressed against his knee, her new lips slipping and sliding over his skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you need a map?&rdquo; she asked with a giggle, releasing his now very hard cock from her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I want a look. Sit up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose trapped both of his legs between hers and sat up. She hunched forward, bringing her crotch even with his, pushing her clit against his cock. She straightened up, and let her hands fall to her sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Trevor leaned up onto his elbows, the warm water sluicing around and between their bodies in the shallow water. He gazed at the transformed boy. Rose was a beauty, with a long slender neck, strong shoulders, slender and graceful arms, with two generous breasts sloping away from her ribs. Her waist was slender, and her hips were wide. Her round thighs rested against his hips, and he looked back up into her face. Her violet eyes blazed with passion and her dark hair cascaded wetly around her face and shoulders, reaching her waist. He reached up and lifted a wet strand of hair away from her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Like a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like?&rdquo; she said coyly, as she ran her hands lightly up from her sides, caressing her flat tummy, rising to the bottoms of her new breasts, and then hefted them for the first time. &ldquo;They are so soft,&rdquo; she said as she squeezed and caressed them, &ldquo;and heavy, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; Trevor said, as he sat up and took one of her breasts in his hands. They were soft, and full, and her nipple was stiff and puffy. He sucked it into his mouth, swirling his tongue around the rubbery promontory. Rose moaned her appreciation, her hips beginning to twitch, pressing her sex on to his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; she said as she reached down to his cock, and lifted herself over it. She could feel the heat radiate from her own vagina, and when she pushed the crown over her swollen lips, she could feel her juices flowing like a fountain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so hot,&rdquo; she gasped, feeling pleasure shoot through her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you are,&rdquo; Trevor agreed, feeling both her need and his own eagerness to satisfy it.</p>
<p>Rose positioned the head within her cleft, and then let her hips fall onto his, pushing the stiff cock into her new vagina with a single stroke, pushing past her hymen without any pain at all. &ldquo;Oh, my god,&rdquo; she gasped, as the feeling of fullness pulsed outward from her womb in waves, making her entire body feel awash in pleasure. Trevor simply held onto her breast, keeping the nipple in his mouth as he felt Rose rock back and forth on his cock.</p>
<p>Rose felt the twin stimulation of Trevor sucking on her breasts and his cock swirling within her vagina and tried to slow herself down. She wanted to savor this first time, but she could not. She found herself pushing harder and harder down onto Trevor&rsquo;s cock, feeling the stiff shaft swing back and forth within her vagina. Her clit pressed down onto his pelvic bone, and she gripped his head and pulled it into her breasts. She could feel her large breasts jostle around his face, her body shaking back and forth as she hurtled herself towards her first female orgasm. She began to whimper in need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good, so good,&rdquo; she gasped with each rock of her hips, the flesh along her ass slapping down on to Trevor. Her hands still pressed his face into her breasts, and Trevor dropped his hands to her hips, guiding her wildly gyrating body, forcing her hips down onto his own, feeling his cock head brush on her cervix.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip;. My &hellip;. GOD!&rdquo; Rose shouted as the orgasm that had been rushing towards her crashed through her body. Trevor struggled for breath as his face was buried in cleavage, feeling his own orgasm rise up as Rose&rsquo;s new muscles deep within her clutched at his cock. Her hips still rocked back and forth, each one another pulse of her orgasm, her thighs were now twitching on their own, out of her control. &ldquo;Oh &hellip;. My &hellip;. TREVOR!&rdquo; she screamed as a cascade of waves raced through her body, triggered by the hotness she felt splashing deep within her new womb. She convulsed with each pulse of Trevor&rsquo;s cock, pressing herself onto him. Finally, after several minutes of quivering aftershocks, she settled down, his cock still buried deep within her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; she whispered into his hair, still pressing his nose into her cleavage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;And the mers say that it gets better after you transition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No way,&rdquo; she said, trying to catch her breath. &ldquo;There is no way that anything can be better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, no way,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>A few moments passed as Rose quivered and twitched, feeling her new body pressed against this man, his slowly deflating cock still buried deep within her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, about being the girl,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She felt her body against his, and gave his semi-hard cock a sharp squeeze with her new interior muscles. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; she giggled as he gasped in pleasure.</p>
<p>When Gabriel and his pod returned to the caves, they found the Moon Pool filled with all the mers. Liga was swimming around in the center of the pool, in premature labor. Her tiny body was wracked with spasms every two or three minutes, and Eric was beside himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said gestation was eleven months?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Pat answered, trying to calm their newest merman. &ldquo;But this is only the second mermaid birth. There is much we don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do something,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; Sally said, stroking her mate. &ldquo;It only looks that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels that way too,&rdquo; Petra said, holding Michelle by her tail, keeping her from swimming towards Liga. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll survive. I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did she start labor?&rdquo; Galina asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This afternoon, just after you left for the lagoon,&rdquo; Alexis answered. &ldquo;She is already in hard labor. It should be anytime, if your delivery was normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it was normal,&rdquo; Petra said, corralling her daughter. &ldquo;But it was a miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dilating,&rdquo; Alexis reported, swimming near her sister wife. &ldquo;I can see the tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will be her name?&rdquo; Eric asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the father, but I need to know her name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be the father,&rdquo; Alexis reassured him. &ldquo;And her name will be Mari, which means love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea that I would be a father this quickly,&rdquo; Eric complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do fine,&rdquo; Sally told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have plenty of help, and you&rsquo;re not—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In charge,&rdquo; Eric finished. &ldquo;I know, I know. But do you have to embarrass me in front of everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of us mermen are in charge,&rdquo; John said, laughing. &ldquo;Get used to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They could now see Mari&rsquo;s flukes and a few centimeters of her tail. It was black and white stripes with black fringes along the trailing edge of her flukes and dorsal ridge. Liga gave another tremendous push, screaming with all her might, and Mari&rsquo;s torso was visible. Her tiny pelvic fins were beating on the water, as though she was eager to be out and about in the world. Liga convulsed again, and Mari slipped out into the water, her tiny arms above her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what she does,&rdquo; Pat said, as Alexis moved towards the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is much smaller than Michelle was,&rdquo; Alexis noted, moving towards the mother and baby, &ldquo;and less developed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mari did seem less conscious of her surroundings, and although her eyes were open, she looked surprised and lost. Liga reached down and gathered the tiny mermaid into her arms, immediately starting for the surface of the pool. The other mers followed. Liga tried to push herself and her daughter up onto the shelf, but she was too weak. Eric immediately sensed her frustration and swam underneath of her, gathering her into his arms, and lifted all three of them up onto the shelf at the edge of the pool. Because Liga was so small, being on Eric&rsquo;s lap actually allowed her to get her breasts out of the water. Sally and Alexis quickly joined them on either side while the other mers bobbed along the surface expectantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on Mari: breathe,&rdquo; Liga urged.</p>
<p>The little mermaid lay cuddled in her mother&rsquo;s arms, blinking her eyes. She flipped her tail up, and twitched her fins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not breathing,&rdquo; Liga worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow on her face,&rdquo; Alexis said.</p>
<p>Liga lifted her daughter up to her face and blew softly into her daughter&rsquo;s dark black eyes. Mari blinked again, but otherwise did not move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow sharply, as though to surprise her,&rdquo; Alexis said.</p>
<p>Liga gave a sharp breath into her face, and Mari opened her mouth in surprise and took her first breath of air. All the mers collectively sighed in relief, and Liga lay back into Eric&rsquo;s embrace, relaxing for the first time in hours. Alexis helped raise Mari to Liga&rsquo;s breasts, and after a moment or two of struggle, Mari took her first mouthfuls of mermaid milk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a bit premature, but she&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; Pat declared. &ldquo;Alexis, you can handle things from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set,&rdquo; she said, reaching back behind her to gather the thread and surgical scissors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will get your dinner,&rdquo; Emma volunteered, and jerked her head at her sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is why we are always on guard duty,&rdquo; Cleo complained. &ldquo;Emma is forever volunteering us to do these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a grump,&rdquo; Rikki said. &ldquo;You know that you always feel better after you do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Cleo complained. &ldquo;I feel better after MuSu has his way with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll be first tonight if you help your sisters,&rdquo; MuSu said with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Cleo squealed and dived after Emma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; Rikki complained, even as MuSu disappeared beneath the surface. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always gets to go first because she&rsquo;s been whining about this or that,&rdquo; she told the remaining mers before diving to follow her pod-mates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until they have kids of their own,&rdquo; Pat said smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help us all,&rdquo; Danni agreed.</p>
<p>Rose stood before the mirror in the old mountainside huts, looking at herself in the red-yellow light of the setting sun as it slanted across her body. Her formerly dark brown hair was now a lustrous black, thick wavy hair that fell over her shoulders and breasts. Her face was indeed like Elizabeth Taylor&rsquo;s, pixie nose, wide and innocent violet eyes with enormous lashes. Her neck was slender and all traces of Robbie&rsquo;s Adam&rsquo;s apple were gone. She brushed her hair back from her cheeks, feeling how soft her skin was, and she looked at how small and delicate her hand was. Her nails were slightly rounded, like mermaid nails, and she could see the slightest bit of webbing in between her fingers. It is good that they were transitioning fully to mermaids in the morning, she thought to herself. There was still tonight, she reminded herself, and she was taking Emma&rsquo;s advice, enjoying as much time as a girl as she could before she became a mermaid.</p>
<p>And before Trevor became her merman, she thought predatorily, listening to Trevor&rsquo;s efforts at bed making in the other hut. She and Trevor had a long night planned, and that bed was going to play a central role. She had been friends with Trevor for many years, and she knew exactly what kind of woman turned him on. Rose was going to be everything that Trevor had ever fantasized. She turned in the mirror, looking at her body&rsquo;s profile. She was tall for a woman, only losing a few inches in the change from Robbie to Rose. He had been just over six feet tall (182 cm), and now she was about five feet, ten inches tall (177 cm). That was fine, because Trevor was at least six foot four inches (193 cm) tall, and she liked being able to rest her head on his chest when they hugged.</p>
<p>Her breasts were large, but she had no idea what bra size she might be. His sisters were both B cups, but hers were definitely larger than theirs. She thrilled to the way they swayed and moved as she turned before the mirror. Her breasts hung away from her body nearly as far as her hips flared out from her waist, she thought as she twisted back and forth, comparing the slope of her hips to the slope of her breasts. She spotted a yardstick on the table near the mirror.</p>
<p>That gave her an idea, and she rummaged through the hut until she found some string. She laid it on the yardstick and tied a knot at 36 inches. She lifted it up and measured round her ribs, just above her breasts. 36 inches! Then she wrapped the string around her breasts, resting it along the tips of her pleasantly stiff nipples. Pinching the string in her fingers, she measured the length of string past the knot. Five, nearly six, inches. She didn&rsquo;t know what cup size that was, but it seemed impressive. She returned the string to her waist. She smiled, only 21 inches, and she knew that was a small waist. Her hips were 38 inches!</p>
<p>Rose smiled back at the mirror, her full lips wide and beautiful around her white teeth. She ran her hands up from her hips, caressing her flat tummy, and then pressing her breasts together. Yes, she had turned into a sexy woman, and she would be an even sexier mermaid. She left the hut, following the sounds of Trevor&rsquo;s activity, like a lioness on the hunt. She could feel the tightness in her nipples in the cooling air, and her groin felt like it was on fire. She entered the hut and found Trevor straightening up from the bed. She leaned on the doorframe, pressing her ass and shoulders into the frame, leaning her head back so that her hair brushed against her ass. She lifted one leg to rest on her tiptoes, and reached back with one hand to hold onto the doorframe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Care to make a girl happy?&rdquo; she asked, knowing the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my god,&rdquo; Trevor said, turning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything more beautiful in my entire life.&rdquo; The setting sun framed Rose in silhouette, the orange and red sky reaching back from the horizon. Her breathing caused her chest to rise and fall as she slowly turned her head towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t answer the question,&rdquo; she said in a sultry tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this for an answer,&rdquo; he said as he quickly strode across the small hut and pulled her into his arms, kissing her soundly. Their bodies pushed together, and Rose could feel his hard on press into her belly, her breasts flattened against his chest. She leaned into his arms, enjoying the strength and support she found there.</p>
<p>He lifted his head back from the beautiful creature, and gazed into her eyes. He saw her eyes glisten in the setting sun, love, lust, and need pouring from them. The look Rose was giving him nearly broke his heart; it was so beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave up everything for me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I gained everything,&rdquo; she said huskily as she pulled him down for another kiss. &ldquo;Make love to me,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Make me yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mine, more than you can know,&rdquo; he said, stooping to sweep her off her feet.</p>
<p>She tucked her head into his neck as he walked the two steps over to the bed and set her down. As he released her, she arched back onto the bed, pushing her breasts high into the air. She looked at Trevor and felt her stomach clench with excitement as she watched him watch her, mesmerized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I good enough to be your mate?&rdquo; she asked, as she lowered her arms to her sides, slowly raising her hands up over her hips. &ldquo;Am I woman enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, baby,&rdquo; Trevor growled, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re more woman than I have ever seen.&rdquo; He watched her as her hands caressed her own wide hips. &ldquo;You will be the most beautiful mermaid tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been looking at the other mermaids?&rdquo; she asked coyly, bringing her hands up to the undersides of her breasts, lightly stroking her abdomen and sides, her body twitching as she hovered between sensuality and tickling herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, after our argument,&rdquo; he said, his eyes riveted on her breasts. &ldquo;I watched MuSu and his three girls make love in one of the small coves on the eastern edge of the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; she asked, moving her hands up to her breasts, stroking all around her nipples, but not touching them. She loved the way she was feeling, her body was tingling everywhere, and her nipples felt like two sparks of fire four inches above her ribs. She encircled both nipples and pulled them up into two points. &ldquo;Ahhhhhh, tell me what you saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trevor reached down to his own stiff penis, and began to stroke it slowly. &ldquo;One of the girls pinned MuSu on the sand, and was fucking him, while the other two were fingering each other nearby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you hear them?&rdquo; Rose asked, pulling her nipples back and forth, feeling her breasts shift back and forth. Her hips began to sway back and forth as her arousal built.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they were very loud when they came,&rdquo; he said, his breathing now growing ragged as he watched Rose masturbate in front of him. She let one of her breasts go, and she snaked down one hand to her groin, pulling on the dark hairs that curled above her sex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that why you agreed to my proposal?&rdquo; she asked, her hips rising and falling as she stroked herself, watching his eyes watch her. &ldquo;Because the mermaids were having sex together? Did you imagine that you would become a mermaid and make love to another mermaid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trevor watched as her fingers rubbed her pussy lips, their circles growing in intensity and effort. He could see beads of sweat on her lips as she spoke, her beautiful face a mask of lust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &hellip; I did,&rdquo; he said, his cock aching, throbbing in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, I &hellip; will &hellip; be &hellip; that &hellip; uh &hellip; uh &hellip; mer &hellip; mer oooooooh, mermaid!&rdquo; Rose cried as she was engulfed by a powerful orgasm that caused her to curl up in a ball, her body shaking as she cried out her release.</p>
<p>Trevor took his hand away from his cock, barely staving off his own orgasm, and watched his new lover quake through her pleasure, her body convulsing, her upper body rising off the bed with each wave that rolled through her torso. When it passed, she spread her legs, and raised her arms to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>He knelt on the bed between her outspread legs, his cock straining out from his body. A light sheen of sweat covered both their bodies. He bent forward and smelled the sweet smell of her arousal. He took two fingers, and pushed them into her sopping opening as she mewled in pleasure. Her insides were on fire, a molten mixture of heat and liquid, and the muscles of her vagina pulsing and grabbing at his fingers. He withdrew them slowly, watching her as she whimpered. He brought his index finger to his lips and slowly sank it into his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ummmmm, good,&rdquo; he said as he withdrew his finger with a pop. &ldquo;You try,&rdquo; he said, extending his middle finger towards her mouth.</p>
<p>Rose tasted herself for the first time, and found the sweet tangy taste irresistible, and she sucked hard on Trevor&rsquo;s finger. With her hands, she reached down and pulled his thick cock towards her steaming crotch. She raised her legs in a V, and rubbed his cock along her cleft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me,&rdquo; she repeated, dropping her hand from his cock, now lodged at the entrance to her vagina.</p>
<p>Trevor brought his other hand forward and pressed himself into a push up position, his arms pinning Rose&rsquo;s arms to her sides, his cock angled into her pussy, with her legs reaching around his hips to draw him into her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she pleaded, arching her hips towards his.</p>
<p>Trevor slammed the first stroke home, and Rose immediately dissolved into a massive orgasm, pulling and clutching at him, her body rocked to its core by the pulsations that swept through her body. She cried out, again and again, as her vagina clutched at his cock, squeezing it, pulling it deeper into her body. When her orgasm slowed, he began to stroke slowly in and out of her, hitting the last inch with force, causing her body to shake, her breasts rocking on her chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip; so &hellip; good &hellip; keep &hellip; doing &hellip; that &hellip; right &hellip; there &hellip;&rdquo; she pleaded, her body lost in the pleasures that overwhelmed her. She loved the feel of her breasts slapping her chin, of her hips being pounded into the bed, and the fullness of Trevor&rsquo;s stiff cock as it drilled into the center of her being. &ldquo;I &hellip; want &hellip; to &hellip; make &hellip; you &hellip; happy,&rdquo; she said with each stroke he pounded into her. She looked up into his blue eyes, and she reached up with her hands, trying to over come the pounding she was getting, to hold his face. She settled instead for holding onto his shoulders, as she needed the stability as Trevor increased his pace, pounding into her like a jackhammer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooooohhhhhh, my &hellip; my &hellip; my &hellip; goooooooooooooooooood,&rdquo; She screamed as she felt the largest orgasm of all sweep upwards from her groin, every muscle in her abdomen pulsing with pleasure.</p>
<p>Trevor released himself into his lover, groaning, feeling great ropes of cum splash into her. When the last of his spurts faded away, he lowered himself onto her, kissing her tenderly as she continued to quiver and shake, her orgasmic tremors lasting for several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not just sex,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She only smiled, still twitching, unable to speak.</p>
<p>To be continued?</p>
