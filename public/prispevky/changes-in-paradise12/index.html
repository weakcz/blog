            <p>Joy recruits an old friend to be a new mer, the Moon Pool itself changes, and the saga continues.</p>
<p>Mark Johnson was fifty-six years old and retired. He was enjoying his usual late afternoon coffee at the Quan Ngon, a small bistro style restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City when he got a short text message on his phone. It was a latitude and longitude followed by a single word: Tarzan. He hadn&rsquo;t seen that code word in a very long time. He looked up at the bustling city around him. &ldquo;Tarzan: was the deep cover order from his former boss at the CIA, Joy Simpson, but she retired several years ago. What was she doing?</p>
<p>He sipped his sweet coffee, suddenly over come by the memories of his last special ops tour in Viet Nam over thirty-five years ago. Joy was a recruiting agent for the CIA, and they couldn&rsquo;t have picked a better one. She was beautiful, smart, sophisticated, ruthless, intensely loyal, and she needed him. In the bitter days that followed his last mission, Joy had probably saved his life. The black ops mission went terribly awry, wiping out the whole team. He tried to shake the memory from his mind; refusing to think about the grief and self-loathing he suffered in the wake of surviving that mission.</p>
<p>How he had survived, he still did not know. One minute they were rigging a listening device high up river in the Mekong, and then next thing he remembered, he was in a hospital. Jones, their team leader, had managed to get all of them back to their PRB (patrol river boat), and back down the river to the extraction point, but only Mark had survived the trip. His wounds probably saved him because he spent the return trip unconscious in the bottom of the boat. Snipers, according to the official report, picked off his teammates one by one, and the one that killed Jones got him seconds before the helicopter showed up. One of the Sea King&rsquo;s UH-1 Iroquois rockets obliterated the sniper, but Mark was the only one the Navy fliers were able to save. Everyone else returned in a body bag.</p>
<p>Joy approached him after his release from the hospital&ndash;headed back to America with a piece of Chinese manufactured lead lodged near his spine. He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of the slug buried in his body; he was terrified of facing the friends and families of the men who he had outlived. Joy begged him to help her, and he could not refuse a damsel in distress. His SEAL training had worked too well. He would help her if it cost him his life, and he hoped that it would.</p>
<p>Later in life, Mark came to realize that second thought was the real reason why he joined Joy&rsquo;s team, not the former. She was beautiful, needed help, and she was persuasive, but ultimately she offered him a way out of his nightmare and an honorable way to die in service to his country. He went from SEAL to secret agent with a grim smile on his face and a flag tattooed over his heart. He never regretted his decision, even though he had survived his time as an agent too, slug or no slug.</p>
<p>Mark spoke nine languages, could make almost anything into a weapon, fly, steer, or drive nearly any machine, and had never married. He didn&rsquo;t know why he returned to Viet Nam when he retired, but it some how felt like home to him. He was still a good-looking man, but he could not bring himself to take a Vietnamese wife. He told himself that it was because he wanted Joy, but she had a thing for some guy in the Navy brass. Became an Admiral or something. What he couldn&rsquo;t admit to himself was that no woman he had met fired his libido, his imagination, and his need to be &ldquo;needed.&rdquo; Sure, many women &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; to be rescued, but few &ldquo;needed&rdquo; him to do something for or with them.</p>
<p>He flipped open his phone and looked at the text message again: Tarzan 3:23:51s - 174:40:52w. Somewhere in the South Pacific, but it was no place that he recognized. Well, perhaps it was better late than never. He wasn&rsquo;t doing much with his life, and as a former cold war warrior who found the new faces of terrorism horrifying and incomprehensible, a new mission with Joy would be exciting and sensible. This time, after he rescued his favorite damsel in distress, perhaps she would grace him with a kiss &hellip; or something more.</p>
<p>Tarzan. Deep cover. No forwarding, no word, just disappear. Well, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time he did that for an old friend. He rose from the table, tossed a few extra dong next to his coffee, and walked out into the crowded street.</p>
<p>Where could he put his hands on a plane that he could afford and wouldn&rsquo;t attract attention?</p>
<p>Emma, Cleo, Rikki and MuSu lay on the beach, looking at the stars. MuSu had sensed something different in his girls after they met Joy and Mac, but he couldn&rsquo;t figure out what changed. It had finally reached the point that he had to take action, and so he took them out for a moonlight swim. He would try to learn what was bothering them with indirect investigations.</p>
<p>He raised himself up and looked at his three mermaids. It struck him, once again, how beautiful they were, and how incredible it was to have triplets for pod-mates. Although each of them looked identical to the others, each was a very unique mermaid. Emma, the stubborn, inquisitive, scientist, lay closest to him, her blue and white tail glowing softly in the moonlight. Her face, like her sister&rsquo;s, was touched with melancholy around her eyes, which even now glistened with tears. Cleo was toying with her hair, always conscious of how she looked, but not always conscious of who was looking. Rikki lay furthest away, her eyes looking back at him. The spitfire among her sisters, she was MuSu&rsquo;s near opposite, but their shared sexual spark was particularly intense. He felt his cock twitch deep within his tail as she gazed at him.</p>
<p>He winked at her and lay back down, thinking and looking at the stars. He felt his cock stir again, but he willed it into submission. He had taken his girls to this secluded beach for a different purpose. As the throbbing faded, he took stock of himself as he puzzled as to why all three girls were so gloomy. As for himself, he found it hard to remember being a human or even being a girl. He had spent most of his life as a spoiled, pretty girl whose father worked in the banking industry in Hong Kong. Alberto had changed all that, and the mers had changed everything. None of those memories helped. Why would Mac and Joy set his girls off?</p>
<p>He sat back up and looked down at himself, flexing his large, strong hands, the yellow webbing in between each finger reaching to his first knuckle. His elbow fins, the same bright yellow, were relaxed, tucked against the back of his arms. He reached up to the sky in a stretch, feeling his neck and back pop, his broad shoulders rolling as he pushed each arm across his chest. He loved the feelings of power his new body gave him, and he was very happy to be both a man and a mer. He stretched out his tail, spreading his flukes apart, watching the yellow and black stripes shimmer in the moonlight. He felt the gaze of his girls on him, and turned to meet their gaze.</p>
<p>The four of them looked at one another in the moonlight, their skin and scales gleaming in the pale, yellow light. MuSu tried to &ldquo;see&rdquo; their mer-bonds in the way that Eric could, but he could not. However, he could feel the strong emotions that bound them together. He closed his eyes and &ldquo;looked&rdquo; at each of his pod-mates. Emma was pensive, but alert, watching him watch her. Cleo was just sad, and Rikki was seething with frustration at her own feelings of melancholy. A new insight suddenly struck him, and he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to go look for them?&rdquo; MuSu asked, guessing at what was eating at his pod-mates. &ldquo;Your parents, do you want to try and find them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three girls sat up and looked at him with a mixture of surprise, sadness, and gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Cleo said with sad realization as her sisters nodded in agreement. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought about you watching Mac and Sally,&rdquo; he said tenderly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what you were feeling, but I could feel your hearts aching. I just guessed. If you like, we can talk to the others about going on an expedition to look for your parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should have asked Alberto before they killed him,&rdquo; Rikki spat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or we could just ask Liga!&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;She might remember what happened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we ever think of that before?&rdquo; Rikki asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we haven&rsquo;t missed our parents since we changed,&rdquo; Cleo said, her intuition guiding her. &ldquo;You, MuSu, have been everything we could need, and it took seeing Sally and Mac together to make us remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, MuSu,&rdquo; Emma said, rolling over on top of him and raining him with kisses. &ldquo;You are the best mate ever. How did we ever get lucky enough to have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, returning Emma&rsquo;s ardent kisses. &ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you take a few minutes to show me before we go back to the caves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may take all three of us to show you,&rdquo; Rikki said, pulling Cleo towards MuSu, surrounding their pod-mate with very relieved and now horny mermaids.</p>
<p>MuSu tugged on his vent muscle and allowed his quickly rising cock to spring free. All three girls put a small delicate hand on his long, stiff member, and began sharing it like a Popsicle. He groaned and lay back down onto the sand. Yes, he was very glad to be their mate.</p>
<p>For the next several hours, sounds of squealing, laughing, moaning, and kissing rose from the beach. It was nearly daylight before the pod headed back for the caves.</p>
<p>Malaki looked up from his desk at his assembled staff. Most of them were hiding their fear quite well; some were not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four weeks?&rdquo; he asked calmly, but everyone could feel the deep anger just below the surface of his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His last message was that he was headed home,&rdquo; one of Malaki&rsquo;s lieutenants said, his brow beading with sweat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After two weeks you did not come to me?&rdquo; Malaki asked, rising to look out of the large window on the city below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found the boat,&rdquo; the visibly shaking man said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found the boat,&rdquo; Malaki said calmly, nodding to one of the large men near the main door to the office.</p>
<p>There was a sharp hiss and the man who had failed Malaki crumpled to the ground. No one in the room flinched. Everyone had seen it coming. One of the bodyguards holstered a needle gun, while two other men came in from the outer office, Sudhish leading them in to the room. They picked up the dead man, a small hole in his neck oozing a small drop of blood. Malaki&rsquo;s personal secretary supervised the other two men as they collected the dead body and left the room, lingering near the door to hear what happened next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abao,&rdquo; Malaki addressed his second son. &ldquo;Find out what happened to your brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the young man responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my money,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Abao said with more confidence than he felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t fuck it up,&rdquo; Malaki finished, dismissing everyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Abao said, the edge of fear creeping into his voice.</p>
<p>He watched as they filed from his office. Manalo had gone missing, the yacht he had been using turned up in Hong Kong. He and the girl had traded Malaki&rsquo;s boat for the one that was bugged with a tracking device, and they had picked up a cripple. According to the report on his desk, Manalo and Shen Chin had taken a handicapped Chinese man with them in the new boat. There might have been others on board, but his agent in Hong Kong couldn&rsquo;t be sure.</p>
<p>Damn it. There was something else going on here. There was something other than Alberto&rsquo;s disappearance along with a few million of his own dollars at work. What? He had three more sons that he could throw at the problem, but he wanted to keep a low profile. Many of his lieutenants were looking for any sign of weakness in his leadership, and Malaki had no doubt that even his vaunted bodyguards could not protect him against a concerted effort by his own people to replace him. He had to keep them all off balance and more than a little bit afraid. His own sons were perfect; the right mixture of loyalty and fear made them trustworthy, and their anger at their own father made them ruthless.</p>
<p>Malaki remembered how his boys reacted when the found their own mother sleeping with one of Malaki&rsquo;s business associates. Despite the oldest only being fourteen, Malaki did not need to raise a finger. His disloyal wife and her lover were both dead instantly. The Islamic Mayor of their small town, along with a few well-placed bribes, insured that his boys escaped any official punishment. The mayor didn&rsquo;t have a very high opinion of women, and the boy&rsquo;s actions were &ldquo;completely justifiable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manalo had been particularly ruthless, cutting off the offending body part of his wife&rsquo;s lover. But that was part of Manalo&rsquo;s problem, he was obsessed with sex, and Malaki wondered if Ms. Chin had influenced his son. Abao was much more of a detective than his eldest son, Manalo was, and far less likely to fall victim to a pretty face. Perhaps Abao&rsquo;s more analytical nature would prove the difference in discovering what happened to Alberto, Tumibay, and now Manalo.</p>
<p>That was it! Ms. Chin was the key to discovering the fates of all three men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Basra,&rdquo; he barked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo; Sudhish answered, entering the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull all files and contacts related to Ms. Chin and her sister,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;I want a report by tomorrow morning that details both of their movements for the past six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; Sudhish answered, as he backed out of the office.</p>
<p>What luck! Malaki was ordering him to do a task he had been trying to do secretly for several days. He would simply make sure to leave some information off, and, he would not mention in his report that he would also be looking for his own sister.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a very good plane anyway, Mark thought to himself as he watched it plod forward in the sky without him. He had only a few seconds before he plunged into the water, cool and refreshing despite hitting the surface at nearly one hundred miles an hour. He had just dropped his pack into the water and tied a dead man&rsquo;s knot around the rudder as the plane circled back over his still floating pack. In the few seconds he had for reflection, he admired the way the plane itself limped towards the water. Even with the flaps down, it was still moving at a pretty good clip.</p>
<p>All of this would have been unnecessary, Mark thought to himself as the water rushed up to greet him, if one of the plane&rsquo;s floats had not fallen off shortly after take off. No wonder he could afford the plane; only hope and hairpins held it together. Still, it had served its purpose, getting him to this small, remote island in the middle of the South Pacific despite everything. He would have preferred to land in the lagoon softly rather than plummeting like a rock towards the open sea just past the reefs. This was going to hurt, he thought to himself.</p>
<p>Still, all in all, the unexpected plunge into the ocean without a parachute didn&rsquo;t really scare him, although it should have. Placing all his trust in that short text message did, however. He was past caring as he hit the water, and his world exploded with bright, glittery pain. Perhaps he would finally get his wish, and this day would be the one on which he would die in the service of others.</p>
<p>A few agonizing moments later, he regained consciousness. It was not going to be his lucky day; he survived yet another brave but foolhardy attempt on his own life. But he was going to pay for this one, as every bone and muscle in his body throbbed with pain. After a few minutes of floating in the water, trying to recover, he could make out some figures on the beach. After a few minutes more, he could see that not all of them were human.</p>
<p>He thought about just sinking into the water&rsquo;s warm embrace, but that seemed so cliché after going through everything that he had suffered. Besides, the strange creatures didn&rsquo;t look threatening, just unbelievable. Although his body ached from his emergency exit, his eyes were still eagle sharp, even at his advanced age. He could see one of the human figures who was walking towards the water, waving; it was Joy Simpson, looking fabulous with her long white hair, deep tan, and one-piece bathing suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark,&rdquo; she shouted, her voice carrying over the sounds of the ocean. &ldquo;Want some help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he shouted back, unsurprised that Joy would know that he had one.</p>
<p>He watched as four figures dashed for the beach, sinuously snaking their way down the sand and into the water. In mere seconds, a beautiful young girl&rsquo;s face popped up in front of him. He nearly drowned gaping in surprise, swallowing water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won,&rdquo; she said, giggling.</p>
<p>Another identical face popped up beside her. &ldquo;No you didn&rsquo;t. MuSu did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t see him anywhere,&rdquo; the first mermaid said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I already have the pack,&rdquo; a handsome Asian merman said, popping up beside Mark. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; the merman asked. &ldquo;That was quite a leap you took.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was &hellip; nothing,&rdquo; Mark said, still trying to assimilate the vision he saw before him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was either the coolest or the most stupid thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen anyone do,&rdquo; the merman said. &ldquo;Is there anything else besides this pack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, no,&rdquo; Mark answered. &ldquo;How did you swim out here so fast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was &hellip; nothing,&rdquo; the merman said with a mysterious smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not hurt, let us push you!&rdquo; one of the mermaids said to Mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Push me?&rdquo; he sputtered, wondering why Joy had called him to this place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hold onto your legs, and push you,&rdquo; she explained as a third identical mermaid joined them, bobbing in the water before him. &ldquo;You just hold your hands out like Superman and body surf on your belly. You&rsquo;ll be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark looked for some sense of sanity from the merman to his left. The handsome young man merely shrugged his shoulders and smiled sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They like to play,&rdquo; MuSu said. &ldquo;My name is MuSu. You must be Mark Johnson. Joy has told us all about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, yes. Well. That is,&rdquo; Mark sputtered. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t told me anything about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Emma, and this is Rikki, and the slowpoke is Cleo,&rdquo; a mermaid said, as the one who arrived late stuck her tongue out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about trying to tell the difference yet. How about that push, and then you can hear all about it from Joy herself?&rdquo; Emma asked. &ldquo;Or do you want to tred water for the next few hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, push away,&rdquo; Mark answered.</p>
<p>It was the right answer, evidently, because MuSu gave him a big smile and ducked under the water and headed for the beach. Mark saw a dorsal fin rise from the merman&rsquo;s back as he picked up speed. The three girls all swam beneath him, and he felt small, feminine hands grip his legs with surprising strength, and then begin to push him forward through the water. He remembered the Superman thing, and stretched his arms out, hydroplaning along the surface of the water, as if they towed him behind a speedboat. His old body, still shocked by his forced entry into the water at nearly one hundred miles per hour, started to protest, but by the time he reached the beach, he was laughing like a kid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything special planned for the next several centuries anyway,&rdquo; Mark said laughing again. By the time Joy, Mac, and the mers finished bringing him up to date, the stars were beginning to appear in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re serious? You can make up your mind that quickly?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Joy,&rdquo; Mark said with a wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has the excellent quality of trusting his commander,&rdquo; Joy said smiling back at her old friend. &ldquo;And he trusts his instincts. You have to, if you want to stay a living agent rather than a dead one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are your real reasons?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p>
<p>Mark gave Mac a long look, and then glanced over at the assembled mers and humans around him. He gave a deep sigh, and then spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, it is clear to me that I&rsquo;m never going to get Joy away from you,&rdquo; Mark said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affirmative,&rdquo; Mac said without rancor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second, this is the first time that I’ve felt that I could become part of a real team since Nam,&rdquo; Mark said with only a tinge of sadness. &ldquo;No offense, Joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None taken. He used to be a SEAL,&rdquo; Joy explained to the mers. &ldquo;And his entire team was wiped out. You know that it wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joy,&rdquo; he started with a dark look in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to stop punishing yourself for surviving!&rdquo; Joy argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you say. And third, my back is still killing me, and I think mermaid milk might just be what the doctor ordered. So, what&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo; Mark asked, trying to divert Joy&rsquo;s comment, looking around at all the mermaids and humans that surrounded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shen?&rdquo; Pat asked after a moment of awkward silence. &ldquo;Have you guys worked it out yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Shen answered looking at her sister and the shy, disfigured French girl. &ldquo;We three will go with Wong, and Trixi, Homa, and Binah will go with Mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that way Trixi will have a male who is stronger and bigger than she is right from the start,&rdquo; Pat said, understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does Trixi need me?&rdquo; Mark asked. &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m complaining. She&rsquo;s cute and I&rsquo;m an old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t stay old for long,&rdquo; Pat answered. &ldquo;And Trixi isn&rsquo;t really a woman, at least not genetically. She still has her boy parts. Are you going to be able to handle that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; Mark said evenly. &ldquo;A SEAL can handle anything, and my word is my bond. I&rsquo;d be honored to be your pod-mate,&rdquo; he said, turning to Trixi, Homa, and Binah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to your first team?&rdquo; Trixi asked. &ldquo;I mean you don&rsquo;t have to answer, if you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joy started to answer, but Mark held up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fair question, but the answer is that I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said heavily. &ldquo;I was wounded, unconscious, and the only survivor. I have always believed that I let my team down; that it was my fault. I know, Joy, I have read the official report myself. But that is not how things go in here,&rdquo; he said tapping his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Trixi said softly. &ldquo;That must have been hard on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced over at Homa to see how she was handling everything. Homa was staring at Mark with an intensity Trixi had never seen before. Trixi nudged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Homa demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were staring,&rdquo; she said in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a man be honest before,&rdquo; she said loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;This shouldn&rsquo;t be your first time. I know lots of guys put up all kinds of bullshit, and do all kinds of crazy things to hide the truth of themselves from other people, and from themselves. But I learned long ago that if you couldn&rsquo;t be honest with yourself, you couldn&rsquo;t appear to be honest to the enemy or anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honesty is sometimes the best foundation for a needful lie,&rdquo; Joy agreed, watching Mark negotiate these damaged women with great skill and compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honesty is a lie?&rdquo; Homa asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only sometimes,&rdquo; Joy said gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never break a promise to a friend,&rdquo; Mark said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you make me a promise?&rdquo; Homa asked, her eyes flashing with emotion.</p>
<p>Mark looked at the young Persian woman, so beautiful but so angry. His long experience as a secret agent gave him many insights into other people, and unfortunately, he knew the look she was giving him all too well. This woman had known abuse, horrible and terrible abuse. She showed more damage, in many ways, than the unfortunately disfigured French girl. Yes, Shen had explained all about Malaki, Manalo, and the brothels, but Mark could see something deeper, angrier, in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Homa, I will make any promise you demand of me as long as you do not ask me to harm you, myself, or others,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Homa blinked. She did not expect that answer. She turned to look at Trixi, and her lover looked back at her steadily, waiting to see what she had to say. She turned back to Mark, summoning up her courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask that,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Mark asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you do not ever harm me, Trixi, or Binah,&rdquo; she said, her eyes welling with tears as emotions swirled within her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t need to promise that, and you didn&rsquo;t want to ask me that,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;What is the promise that you really want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want &hellip; you to &hellip; to &hellip; promise &hellip; to &hellip; never &hellip; touch me &hellip; with out my permission or invitation,&rdquo; she struggled to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; Mark said without hesitation. &ldquo;I promise to never harm you or the other mers or to allow harm to come to you through my own inaction, and I promise never to touch you unless you ask me to,&rdquo; Mark said, holding her gaze in his.</p>
<p>A tense moment passed as Homa wavered between anger and hope, screaming or crying. No one moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trixi, Binah,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I make the same promises to you too. What Homa asks I will give to all three of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Homa gasped and bit her hand. Tears fell silently from her eyes despite every effort she made to stop them. Had she so misjudged men? How could this one be so different? Why was he so different? He was an old man, nearly sixty, but he stood before them like a rock, unwavering. She watched him as he shifted his eyes to each of them, one at a time, holding their gaze without fear or deception. She could feel Binah, then Trixi each nod their heads to him, and then his gaze was on her.</p>
<p>His graying hair was short in a military style haircut, his face was clean shaven, his steel blue eyes were steady and calm, and he looked nothing like the dark figures of men who populated her nightmares, most especially her own father. Her earliest memories of him, of his dark, brooding face with bushy, dark eyebrows and his dark beard looming over her bed in the middle of the night &hellip; touching her &hellip; taking her &hellip; while her siblings slept in the next room. Homa blinked again, clearing her head.</p>
<p>She nodded, her heart pounding with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Let&rsquo;s get started,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;Non-pregnant feeders only until we get the two pods situated into separate areas. Once Wong gets some weight on his bones, anyone can do the second or third feedings. We don&rsquo;t want him to be dominated by his own girls. I think that Mark, however, will dominate his girl&rsquo;s just fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only with their permission,&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;A promise is a promise, and domination isn&rsquo;t my style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trixi looked at Homa, checking to see that she was keeping herself under control. She was still biting her fist, but she had stopped crying. Trixi tried to think of something to ease the tension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your style?&rdquo; Trixi asked with a twinkle in her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mutual satisfaction,&rdquo; he said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you don&rsquo;t remember anything more?&rdquo; Cleo asked, her voice catching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cleo,&rdquo; Liga sighed, stroking her hair in sympathy. &ldquo;I wish I did, but I wasn&rsquo;t on that boat. Now, there is no one left who was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence as the pods floated in the Moon Pool, waiting for MuSu&rsquo;s pod to say something. Pat had to admit that it was something of a stroke of genius for the girls to remember that Liga, formerly Lakan, might remember what had happened to their parents. But unfortunately, she wasn&rsquo;t on their boat when it was pirated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can be blunt?&rdquo; Liga asked softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, go right ahead,&rdquo; Rikki said, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is definitely dead,&rdquo; she said, soothing Mari as her child twitched in her arms. &ldquo;Alberto would never have let a mature man live for very long. It wasn&rsquo;t his style. Your mother might be, but she would have been sold into prostitution right away, and that means that she would be local, somewhere close like Davao, Suva, or even Tarawa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think my mom might be alive?&rdquo; Emma asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not really,&rdquo; Liga said sadly. &ldquo;It would take a miracle. Women your mother&rsquo;s age usually went right to snuff fantasies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snuff?&rdquo; Cleo asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snuffed out, like a candle,&rdquo; Liga said. &ldquo;By men who kill, wanting to dominate women to the point of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Cleo said, fighting back tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miracle, huh?&rdquo; Emma said, setting her jaw. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine with me. I&rsquo;m already a miracle, and I think Mom deserves one too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; Rikki agreed.</p>
<p>Cleo merely nodded, still shocked at learning what a snuff fantasy was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait until we get everyone transitioned, and then we can talk about how you might develop a plan for looking for your mother,&rdquo; Pat suggested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already hit the lottery on becoming mers; maybe there is more luck for you. Don&rsquo;t cry, you&rsquo;ll always have us as a family,&rdquo; she said, putting her arm around Emma as the young mermaid began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will look,&rdquo; MuSu said firmly, his girls all lifting their heads to look at him. &ldquo;We will look soon, and we will find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudhish&rsquo;s fingers shook with both fear and anger as he read the file he held. They had taken Geeta, his older sister, to Hong Kong to be &ldquo;trained,&rdquo; and were to kidnap Rani and Vidya, his two younger sisters, in four weeks, as soon as they finished school. He took a deep breath, calming his body, and used his old trick of photographic memorization to scan the entire file, the names, places, dates, and methods Malaki planned on using to keep him in line as his personal executive assistant. Within a few moments, he had scanned all the materials for his own family, and he moved on to Ms. Chin&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Sudhish kept his breathing even, using the meditative techniques he had learned as a young boy, to help him control his anger and shock. The more he learned about Shen Chin, the more he recognized similar qualities and events in his own life. They both had gone to Oxford for college. They both had several siblings in a rare family that valued the women of the family nearly as much as the men. Both he and Shen spoke several languages, and both of them had studied a mixture of politics and literature while students. Finally, both he and Shen had Professor Yuen Foong Hong while at Oxford, despite the fact that both he and Shen had different majors.</p>
<p>Sudhish tried to think of a reason why Dr. Hong would be the only professor they had in common. He remembered that Hong was from Harvard, and researched contemporary Chinese history. Shen had studied business and Sudhish had studied literature. Dr. Hong wasn&rsquo;t a language specialist, which might have explained why both Shen and he would have taken him, and there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any other files on Hong that helped explain the connection.</p>
<p>Sudhish assembled the files on the Chin sisters, and began to write his report. Manalo had ordered Lin&rsquo;s transfer five weeks ago to Davao, one of their most notorious brothels, and one from which the young women and boys were not likely to emerge. The rescue plan, therefore, had to be a recent one. There was no information on the young man who they had picked up in Hong Kong, no name, no identification, but then the Chinese barely acknowledged that such people with physical disabilities actually existed.</p>
<p>The boat they had traded was more of a pleasure yacht than the luxury &ldquo;workhorse&rdquo; they had left with Thomson Marine, and they likely lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the trade, so Chin and Manalo had money to burn, Sudhish thought, probably Malaki&rsquo;s money. They weren&rsquo;t coming back, that much was clear to him. What interested him more was how Shen Chin had managed to turn Manalo to an ally. Sudhish had seen the staff picture of the pretty girl, and he doubted that a similar tactic might work for him. He wasn&rsquo;t going to seduce anyone.</p>
<p>He finished up his report, leaving no facts off of his analysis of Ms. Chin&rsquo;s likely whereabouts, and history, but he left out all the facts of processes, procedures, and loopholes that he himself hoped to exploit to rescue his own sister, and to prevent further harm coming to his younger sisters. Also, he left off the report the fact that he knew where his own sister was working.</p>
<p>Esmée pulled back from Emma’s breast, feeling the power of mermaid milk course through her body. She felt her newly lengthened hair caress her back, and she knew that her face was finally whole. She raised her fingers to her lips, and felt for the first time in many years, a rich smoothness that had been missing. Her face, lips, and ear had healed!</p>
<p>She smiled a billion watt smile at Wong, who was finishing with Rikki. Wong could now move his legs but walking was still beyond his capabilities. Everyone was impressed with how well he handled the pain of his spine healing. He never gave so much as a whimper, even as sweat popped from his brow and his body twitched in agony. If his girls had any doubts about his suitability as their pod-mate, he had dispelled them. He was still growing in stature, and his body was filling out in all directions, especially the one she now required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wong,&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;À quoi est-ce que je ressemble maintenant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like a vision from heaven,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You are very beautiful, and I never could have dreamed that such a beautiful woman would be with someone like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esmée smiled, and slinked her perfect body over to the slim Chinese youth. His body was taut and smooth, nicely muscled, but thin. He looked like a high school swimmer, if he added a few more pounds. She turned and looked at her soon-to-be-pod-mates, Shen and Lin. Each of them was the picture of health, and they were each finishing with Timi and Ragi. She turned to Wong and kissed him soundly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will be back to feed us in a few hours?&rdquo; she asked the two sisters as they salamandered over to the small pool in the transition cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will be Dawn, Sandi, Sally, and Galina,&rdquo; Rikki answered. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going slowly with you guys to insure Wong doesn&rsquo;t run into any problems. No moms allowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can almost walk now,&rdquo; he said proudly. &ldquo;I am fine. We will be ready for anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until you can actually walk, we are going slowly,&rdquo; Emma repeated. &ldquo;You have lots of food to eat, and your girls are all concentrating on getting you strong and big, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; the three girls chorused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is Trixi doing?&rdquo; Shen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, we think,&rdquo; Rikki answered. &ldquo;They have been using moms on the beach because Mark was never in any danger of being over powered by those women. Do you know he could bench press over 100 kg (220 lb) even though he was almost sixty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;MuSu can do twice that,&rdquo; Emma said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But &hellip; er &hellip; I didn&rsquo;t &hellip; oh, Emma,&rdquo; Rikki said exasperated. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean anything by that comment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Emma said with a smile. &ldquo;But it was fun to tease you. God, sometimes you&rsquo;re worse than Cleo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a low blow,&rdquo; Rikki said, as she playfully smacked her sisterwife with her tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; Emma protested. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re distracting Wong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wong merely smiled as Esmée settled herself onto his lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wong, open up,&rdquo; Esmée ordered. &ldquo;You have got some growing to do. Now eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was supposed to be dominating you guys,&rdquo; he said plaintively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll learn,&rdquo; Emma said with a smile. &ldquo;They all do eventually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will I learn?&rdquo; Wong demanded as Esmée forced some fish into his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we are allowing you to stay a man,&rdquo; Esmée said sweetly. &ldquo;Est-ce que je les filles suis droites?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; Shen and Lin answered. &ldquo;Girls are in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, just because you are eating, doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t do something else,&rdquo; Esmée said as she straddled the young man&rsquo;s hips, gently forcing another bite into his mouth. &ldquo;Shen, if you please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shen reached over and guided Wong&rsquo;s stiffening cock up to Esmée&rsquo;s crotch, holding it steady as she lowered herself onto him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ummmmm,&rdquo; she moaned as she sank down onto him. &ldquo;Would you like some more?&rdquo; she asked, holding the fish in her hand.</p>
<p>Wong nodded as Esmée began to move her hips.</p>
<p>Trixi approached Pat&rsquo;s breast with something close to reverence. Her breast was perfect, the nipple was stiff and protruding out from her areola, a few drops of mermaid&rsquo;s milk oozing from the tip. Trixi sat down next to Pat, who still had her arms out, waiting for her to settle into her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to bite you,&rdquo; she teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Trixi said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that &hellip; this &hellip; you &hellip; you’re so beautiful. You&rsquo;re everything I ever wanted to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed anyone who would have tried to tell me differently a few years ago, but being a mermaid is a wonderful thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just talking about being a woman,&rdquo; Trixi said. &ldquo;A real woman who could have a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not going to be anything other than a tweener if you don&rsquo;t settle down and take a drink,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;Look, everyone else is feeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trixi gazed around her at the mers and people spread out on the beach. Mark&rsquo;s soon-to-be-pod had returned to the beach to start their transition. Wong&rsquo;s pod would transition to mers before they did so that Trixi, as per Rose&rsquo;s and Emma&rsquo;s advice, could enjoy some time as a human female before the change into a mermaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because being a human girl is so special,&rdquo; Rose had warned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because you won&rsquo;t appreciate the difference when you become a mer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; Emma had agreed. &ldquo;I thought I was missing out on something because I went from boy to mermaid pretty quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mer-life and mer-sex is better,&rdquo; Rose had told her. &ldquo;But it is good to know for sure for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trixi smiled at the memory, and adjusted her crotch. Her small penis was beginning to stiffen at the thought of the journey that lay before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Pat urged. &ldquo;I have to get back to Maureen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trixi felt a wave of emotion wash over her, and she quickly lowered her head to Pat&rsquo;s lap, and allowed Pat to guide her towards her breast. The nipple felt like a small thumb in her mouth, a warm and nubby thumb with sweet milk that gushed into her mouth. Trixi swallowed reflexively, the unexpected spurt filling her mouth. She leaned into Pat&rsquo;s breast and sucked harder, hearing Pat gasp above her. The milk was so &hellip; good &hellip; so &hellip; warm &hellip; so &hellip; powerful.</p>
<p>Trixi could feel the milk coursing through her body almost immediately, and she felt a pain in her own chest. The pain of healing, she remembered, as she sucked harder on the gushing breast that fed her. She could feel her chest slowly deflating as the siren cells attacked the implants inserted many years ago, and her &ldquo;normal&rdquo; male musculature was &ldquo;healed.&rdquo; After a few minutes, the pain lessened, and Trixi&rsquo;s abdomen felt full. The saline solution was now in her body, and she didn&rsquo;t know what was being done to the plastic bags that had once held them in place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough there, young lady,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;I have to save the other side for Maureen. You&rsquo;ve had quite enough for your first official feeding. Now scoot back over to Mark, and get started towards womanhood again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trixi smiled up at Pat, savoring the sweet taste of mermaid&rsquo;s milk. She sat up and looked over at Mark, who had already finished with Petra. She felt a twinge of jealousy; she wanted to look like that! Mark, however, was paying no attention to Petra as she salamandered back into the water. He was staring at her. Trixi felt a shiver go through her body, partly aggressive, partly sexual, and partly surrender. She understood that this was the moment; that now was the window of opportunity. She could challenge Mark, try to wrestle him down and become a man again.</p>
<p>Or not. Who was she kidding? She did not want to be a man, and so she ruthlessly repressed the aggressive feelings that rose in her body. She was going to be a woman! She clasped her hands behind her back, thrusting her now flat chest towards Mark. She knew that she was not a very pretty woman now, but she wouldn&rsquo;t be for long!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, help me?&rdquo; she asked, looking down at the sand.</p>
<p>Mark rose from where he had been sitting, and checked to see that Homa and Binah were still feeding with Phoebe and Xing. He would have Trixi to himself for a few minutes at least. He walked over to the tall, thin transsexual and brushed the medium length blond hair from her face. They were nearly the same height, and Mark could sense the battle within his/her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to help you with?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to be like her,&rdquo; Trixi said, nodding at Petra&rsquo;s retreating form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she is especially pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Trixi stammered. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think Petra is beautiful &hellip; with those incredible breasts and her thin waist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think Homa is beautiful?&rdquo; he asked softly. &ldquo;Or Pat, or Xing, or Binah, or Esmée, or even Timi as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., I get the point,&rdquo; Trixi said. &ldquo;Just help me become something you think is attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding someone attractive is more than just hormones and hair, breasts and butts,&rdquo; Mark said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to be beautiful, to be &hellip; a woman,&rdquo; Trixi said, not sure where Mark was headed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it that you truly desire?&rdquo; Mark asked, searching her eyes. &ldquo;Is it merely beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want &hellip; I want &hellip; to &hellip; be loved,&rdquo; Trixi said with difficulty. &ldquo;To be loved as a woman. I want to be worthy of someone’s love. Your love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are worthy of love,&rdquo; Mark said, feeling the healing milk course through his own body, filling him with energy he hadn&rsquo;t felt in years. &ldquo;And you are beautiful. Moreover, it has nothing to do with your looks or your gender. May I kiss you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, god &hellip; yes,&rdquo; Trixi swooned.</p>
<p>Mark took the thin &ldquo;girl&rdquo; into his arms and kissed her, feeling the slightest trace of stubble against his own. He knew that both of them would lose their facial hair in the change to mers, but feeling even that little bit on Trixi was strange to him. He knew that he could not react, and so he simply kissed her harder and turned her into a dip.</p>
<p>Trixi inwardly groaned when she realized that both of their faces were stubbly, but she nearly fainted with pleasure when he dipped her down, and thrust his tongue into her mouth. She could feel her body &ldquo;turn&rdquo; just as Sandi, Rose, Emma, and the others had said she would. She melted into the kiss, willing her body to change, clutching at his strong shoulders as he held her above the sand. When he lifted them up, both of their eyes were shinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What planet did you come from?&rdquo; she asked softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s a long story,&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;But through fire and ice, true steel is tempered. Some people have to live through hell to know when heaven beckons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her in his arms again, and kissed her. He pressed his body against hers, feeling his old joints loosen and his aches and pains fall from his consciousness. He felt her sink into his arms, and her lips widen around his as she slipped inexorably towards womanhood. When he released her, her flat chest was heaving with passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Homa,&rdquo; Trixi squealed as her soon-to-be-pod-mate rose from the sand to join them. &ldquo;He did it! I&rsquo;ve turned. I’m going to be a real woman. Kiss me again!&rdquo; she said as she threw herself into his arms.</p>
<p>Mark complied, and as they kissed a memory from Viet Nam bubbled up. Dian Parkinson, a former Miss America who came with Bob Hope on his Christmas Tour in 1972. She was pretty, sweet, blond, and that&rsquo;s who Trixi reminded him of, despite the latter&rsquo;s tall coltish looks and angular face. Remembering all the coaching from John and Trevor, he focused his mind on that memory. That lovely lady, who became a hostess on &ldquo;The Price is Right,&rdquo; and later even did a Playboy special edition. He focused his mind on that memory, on her classic hourglass figure—37-23-37—and her beautiful and sexy face.</p>
<p>Trixi felt a change in Mark&rsquo;s kisses, and she realized that he was focusing his concentration on her. She broke off the kiss and fell to her knees, feeling the siren cells building energy in her body, shaping her, changing her. She looked at Mark&rsquo;s crotch, and slid her fingers along his waistband, noting that her hand was changing. As she watched with fascination, her index finger grew longer and her ring finger shrank even as her entire hand got smaller. Her hands were changing into a woman&rsquo;s hand!</p>
<p>She pulled at the snap of his shorts with her now delicate, but still aching fingers, and pulled them down to the ground. Mark&rsquo;s cock popped free, only slightly hard, dropping towards her face. She felt Homa staring at them, and she could see Binah come up on the other side of Mark, her dark legs shining in the bright sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Trixi hissed, looking up into Mark&rsquo;s face, feeling the changes he was focusing on her body. Her hips throbbed, her shoulders ached, and her face hurt, but it was all good pain, wonderful pain. She wanted more.</p>
<p>She reached forward and took his cock into her hand, and noticed the gray hairs scattered around his cock and balls. She giggled, remembering that most of her former clients who were Asian did not gray the way Occidentals did. Even as she watched, Trixi could see that Mark&rsquo;s genitals were growing, and that his skin was tightening, looking younger and healthier. She gave his cock a lick, and felt a corresponding wave of change sweep through her body.</p>
<p>The connection &hellip; if they were connected, it would make the bioelectric influences on her siren cells even stronger. She lifted his still stiffening cock to her mouth and sucked it in. She buried her nose in his pubic hair, and smelled his musky smell. She felt his cock lurch in her mouth, growing in her mouth, stiffening. When it was fully erect, it was now about seven inches long. She pulled it into her mouth again, and she felt her hips begin to spread outwards. Ah, the pain! The welcome, wonderful pain! She sucked even harder, and Mark rewarded her with a groan, as he unexpectedly erupted into her mouth. She swallowed as much as she could but some dribbled on her lips and chin.</p>
<p>Mark steadied his legs, which nearly buckled, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was amazing,&rdquo; he said, reaching down to stroke Trixi&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never felt anything like that before in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you liked it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can feel it working,&rdquo; she groaned as she ran her hands over her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; Mark asked. &ldquo;You sound like you&rsquo;re in pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t hurt much,&rdquo; she lied. &ldquo;Keep concentrating! Make me the woman I&rsquo;ve always dreamed I could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark looked at both Binah and Homa and silently urged them to participate. Trixi moaned with more pleasure and less pain as Mark and Binah reached out and put their hands on her body. She could feel their mental energies as a gentle pressure on her body and mind, shaping and morphing her body. She ran her own hands over theirs, stroking her own skin as her body changed. Although she had been taking hormones for several years, the radical change to her skin by the siren cells was dramatic. She reveled in the new softness that she felt under her fingertips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Homa,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Come feel my skin. I&rsquo;m turning into a woman, a soft, beautiful woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Homa stood gaping at the sight before her. Her lover Trixi was on her knees before a man. Yes, he was a special man, perhaps, but he was still a man. Binah, her roommate of the last month, was standing next to him, stroking Trixi&rsquo;s back. Although Mark was certainly more muscular than Binah, she still towered over all of them at nearly six feet tall. Yet she was pressing herself into him, pushing her breasts and body into his side. Homa felt fear, disgust, and desire all mixing and crashing together within her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &hellip; I &hellip; can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, close to sobbing.</p>
<p>Trixi sensed the great turmoil within Homa, and she rose to her feet and walked over to her lover. With Mark&rsquo;s semen still coating her lips and chin, Trixi kissed her, hoping that the effect of Mark&rsquo;s semen would not be catastrophic to Homa.</p>
<p>Homa sensed something on Trixi&rsquo;s lips, but she pressed into the kiss, thrusting her tongue into Trixi&rsquo;s mouth. She knew what Trixi had done, but she also knew that she couldn&rsquo;t fight her demons alone. She needed Trixi. The lingering taste of Mark&rsquo;s cum was not nearly as horrific as she thought it would be, and Trixi&rsquo;s skin was softer, her lips were fuller, and Homa could even sense that Trixi was shrinking. Trixi groaned from a mixture of the pleasure from the kiss and the pain that coursed through her skeleton as the siren cell attacked her bones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing to her?&rdquo; Homa demanded, turning to Mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing I haven&rsquo;t asked him to do,&rdquo; Trixi answered. &ldquo;Pat said it would hurt, and it does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is she shrinking?&rdquo; Homa asked, holding Trixi&rsquo;s hands in her own. &ldquo;Why not keep her the same height?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Trixi hissed. &ldquo;I want to be just like you &hellip; only blond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should get into the water,&rdquo; Binah suggested. &ldquo;Emma told me that it would help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trixi looked at Mark and he immediately understood her silent request. He slipped beside her and lifted her into his arms. Trixi refused to let go of Homa&rsquo;s hand, and together the four of them wadded out into the water. Once they were up to Homa&rsquo;s waist, Mark let Trixi float on her back. Homa cradled her head, and Binah helped support her legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip; it hurts so good,&rdquo; Trixi said as she grimaced in pain.</p>
<p>For the next few minutes they watched as Trixi&rsquo;s body slowly changed from a five foot ten inch tall, flat-chested transsexual into a five foot five inch tall womanly shaped transsexual. Her hair slowly lengthened and her face softened into the classically shaped features of a young girl. She refused to let go of Homa&rsquo;s hand, and after a while, Homa stopped trying to leave. If Eric had been there, he could have told the four of them that the first tendrils of mer-connectivity had formed, tiny strands of light swirling among and between the four of them.</p>
<p>Homa watched Trixi&rsquo;s body change with rapt attention. She was slowly turning into a true beauty, and Homa&rsquo;s attraction to Trixi was increasing with each change. Her eyes became wide set, and her mouth became fuller and more feminine. Her blue eyes sparkled with a new intensity, and her blond hair grew thick and long. Homa&rsquo;s own hair was also growing, and it now hung below her breasts. Other than her longer hair and general physical health, she wasn&rsquo;t changing very much, but she could feel herself changing mentally. After two hours of soaking in the water with Mark, Trixi, and Binah, Homa changed more than she realized.</p>
<p>Trixi stopped moaning after the first twenty minutes, and after another hour, she felt well enough to return to the beach. Petra, Xing, Liga, and Alexis showed up shortly thereafter for their next feeding. Trixi walked purposefully towards Petra, determined to take from her generous breasts the complete womanhood she so desperately wanted.</p>
<p>Wong Shang Han flexed his legs, jumping up and down on the sandy floor of the Change Cave. He was now almost six feet tall and moderately muscled. Shen and Lin were now classic Chinese beauties, each about five feet six inches tall, and Esmée was a smoldering French beauty also five feet six inches tall. Wong wondered what he looked like, and thought to suggest that the mers find a mirror for this cave. He need not have worried, however, as he noticed the predatory looks his three girls were giving him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knew he would turn out so well?&rdquo; Esmée growled, feeling her completely healed body glow with sexual desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; Shen said. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s even better looking than his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come we haven&rsquo;t changed?&rdquo; Lin asked, running her hands along her willowy body. All three girls had remained more or less unchanged. Their slender bodies and modest curves had not been &ldquo;improved&rdquo; in any way. The only difference was that their dark hair was now down to their hips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you three are perfect in every way,&rdquo; Wong said, stroking Lin&rsquo;s long, thick, shiny black hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are perfect too,&rdquo; Esmée said, pushing her own B cup breasts into Lin&rsquo;s breasts. &ldquo;Petra&rsquo;s breasts are just too big. Who would want to lug those around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why were most of our fellow prostitutes forced to have implants?&rdquo; Lin asked, grinding her slender but shapely hips into Esmée&rsquo;s hips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because most men are stupid,&rdquo; Shen answered, &ldquo;and Manalo wanted to make as much money as possible off your bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not ours, then?&rdquo; Lin asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we were used for pleasure seekers of a different sort,&rdquo; Esmée said, shuddering at the memory. &ldquo;But that is all behind us now, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Wong said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least there is one of us that is greatly changed,&rdquo; Shen said, reaching out to Wong&rsquo;s now impressive cock, nearly seven inches long and hardening in her grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Esmée said, kissing Lin. &ldquo;How about we put that to good use before we make the transition to mers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t we want to have sex again after we change?&rdquo; Lin asked, her breathing increasing as their bodies slid against one another&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quel est le problème avec faire l&rsquo;amour deux fois?&rdquo; Esmée giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She asked if you had a problem with making love twice,&rdquo; Shen translated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understood her,&rdquo; Lin protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuo was right,&rdquo; Shen said, awed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right how?&rdquo; Esmée asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mer bonds are already forming,&rdquo; Shen said with some reverence. &ldquo;Lin already understands you, and she&rsquo;s never had a day of French in her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Trixi finished with Petra, she could feel the siren cells reorganizing her internal organs into her new gender. It felt strange, but it didn&rsquo;t hurt the way her skeletal changes had. She felt a little queasy, but she was not going to let that get in the way of progress.</p>
<p>For the first half an hour, she lay next to Mark, touching him as Binah took her turn with him, riding him to a thundering orgasm. She cleaned up both of them, and then shared her kisses with Homa, who was slowly becoming more at ease with Mark, but she could not bring herself to touch him directly.</p>
<p>Then Trixi felt an opening slowly emerge in her crotch, and she knew that her vagina had begun its final stages of development. She wanted to be finished! She pulled Mark into a standing position and knelt to take his quickly recovering cock into her mouth. Binah took Homa off to one side and lavished kisses and caresses on her while Trixi was busy with Mark.</p>
<p>Trixi had sucked on many cocks in the past few years, but Mark&rsquo;s was the first one that she actually wanted to suck. It tasted and felt delicious to her. It had grown to well over seven inches, which caused her both alarm and excitement. Alarm because her own vagina was so new, and excitement because it was beautiful. She quickly and expertly brought him to orgasm, and great streams of semen flooded down her throat, each pulse adding to the siren cells that were already at work in her body.</p>
<p>As Trixi swallowed the last pulse from Mark&rsquo;s cock, she felt Mark&rsquo;s renewed focus on her body, responding to his concentration, rushing to finish its transition into womanhood. She swooned with pleasure as her nipples grew and a new pressure expanded behind her enlarging nipples. She kept Mark&rsquo;s cock in her mouth, willing him to stay hard as she arched her back, trying to force her breasts to grow. She felt her long hair caress her very slender waist, and rocked her wide hips back and forth over her feet as she knelt with her feet under her shapely ass. With each passing second, she could feel her breasts push outwards, slowly, sensuously growing. Finally, as she continued rocking, she felt their weight move independently of her ribs. A thrill ran through her body; she had real breasts!</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, Mark&rsquo;s stiff cock in her mouth, lifting one hand to each heavy breast. She pulled on them, pushing them together, her nipples tingling as they stiffened into the air several inches from her ribs. Her skin felt soft, and her breasts were both firm and soft at the same time. The feel of her fingers rubbing along the undersides of her breasts sent delightful shivers of pleasure across her torso.</p>
<p>Her new womb began to throb, a feeling of emptiness intensifying within her abdomen. She could feel the new lips of her vulva swell, and a feeling of wetness that she had never experienced before, oozed from deep within her body. Finally, she could sense that the siren cells were nearly finished, her last sensations were of a light tingling along her back, signifying that her proto-gills had appeared. The next day, they would all become mers.</p>
<p>She let Mark&rsquo;s cock slip from her mouth, and she gazed down at her vastly changed body. She dropped her hands to her sides and watched her breasts swing heavily from her slender rib cage, arching away from her flat tummy. She rocked her shoulders to help them sway, her nipples stiff in the early evening breeze. She grabbed them again, lifting them up, watching the deep cleavage form between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah &hellip; thank you,&rdquo; she said as she sat back on her heels, looking up at Mark as she cradled her very large breasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pleasure, Trixi, is entirely mine,&rdquo; he said, his cock still twitching from her aggressive oral techniques. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s still hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had our three feedings, and tonight we will put that wonderful tool to good use,&rdquo; Trixi said. &ldquo;We might not let it ever go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; Mark asked. &ldquo;Homa too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her time,&rdquo; Trixi said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s almost there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has been incredibly cruel to her,&rdquo; Mark observed, watching as Homa finished feeding from Alexis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a very perceptive man,&rdquo; Trixi said. &ldquo;Her own father raped her when she was eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Muslims &hellip;&rdquo; Mark began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever say that word in earshot of Homa,&rdquo; Trixi warned. &ldquo;Incest happens in all cultures and all religions. And there is a statistical relationship between how repressive a culture or religion is, and the incidence of incest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Mark said, thinking. &ldquo;I just assumed that &hellip; yea, never mind. I have no idea what I was thinking. Do you think mers are capable of incest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Trixi said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t truthfully answer that until I am a mermaid myself. But it seems unlikely given both mer-bonding and mer-senses. Anyone within a hundred yards of another mermaid pretty much knows what&rsquo;s going on. It would be hard to attack someone without other mers knowing immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Not about the mers, but about the incest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, Homa told me everything, and second, there were several reasons why I wanted to become a woman,&rdquo; Trixi said softly. &ldquo;One was my uncle who &hellip; who &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>They both paused as two dolphins surfaced in the lagoon, clicking and squealing. Mark and Trixi watched in silence as they circled twice, and seeing that none of their &ldquo;creators&rdquo; were present, headed back out past the reef. Marked looked back at Binah and Homa who were locked in an embrace. Mark turned back to Trixi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to tell me, if you don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; Mark said gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that sounds familiar,&rdquo; Trixi said, smiling. &ldquo;No, you answered my question, I&rsquo;ll answer yours. He forced me to give him oral sex when I was ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re so &hellip; so enthusiastic now,&rdquo; Mark said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgiven him, and myself,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Besides, I really like you,&rdquo; Trixi said shyly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never forced anyone to have sex, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not my style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ummm, right, mutual satisfaction,&rdquo; Trixi purred. &ldquo;How about you get to work on that?&rdquo; she asked as she lay back onto the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you want me to touch you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to fuck me,&rdquo; she said, arching her new breasts into the air and spreading her legs wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Trixi dipped her hand down to her crotch, and felt the heat and wetness flow from her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so ready,&rdquo; she breathed as she put two fingers into her vagina, and felt the hot slickness within. She took them out as Mark sank to his knees between her outspread legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about sand in &hellip;&rdquo; he protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s risk it!&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;I need you in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dipped her fingers back into her new opening and swirled them around, making slurping noises. Mark watched entranced. He now looked twenty-five years old. His light brown hair hung about his neck and shoulders in curly waves, and his blue eyes shone like diamonds in the dusk. His shoulders were broad and strong, and his abdomen was ripped and tight. His still-stiff cock hung nearly eight inches into the air. She grabbed his pole with her slick fingers and guided him towards her new opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she urged, pushing her hips up towards his, enjoying both the feeling of anticipation in her groin and the feeling of her breasts jiggle on her chest.</p>
<p>Mark stretched out over her in a military push up position, holding his body straight, the tip of his cock nestled in her nether lips but not entering, even as she swirled her hips to force his cock into her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Mutual satisfaction, remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stilled her hips and waited, watching his face as he held himself above her. Her body quivered in anticipation as she felt his steely eyes bore into her. Her nipples throbbed, and she wanted to pull on them, but a look from Mark kept her arms at her sides. She watched him look at her. His gaze traveled from her face to her breasts, and she arched a little more until she heard him clear his throat, and she relaxed back into the sand. His eyes drank in her slender waist, and flat stomach, her jutting hip bones and beyond them, her legs splayed outward, her knees relaxed against the sand, her calves pointing at his feet, pressed into the sand.</p>
<p>He hitched his hips a little bit, as the bulbous head slipped into her. She gasped with pleasure, feeling it stretch her open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relax,&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<p>Trixi struggled to control her breathing, feeling her chest rise and fall. She turned and saw Binah and Homa move into a sixty-nine, and then returned to gaze at Mark. He held himself above her effortlessly, and she reached up and ran her fingers along his shoulders and torso.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re supposed to relax,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hips only,&rdquo; Trixi said. &ldquo;I want to touch you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; he said, and began to lower himself towards her.</p>
<p>Trixi grabbed his shoulders as she felt him push into her. His cock seemed huge, stretching her open, filling her. His body continued to come closer and closer to hers, slowly entering her. She kept waiting for her hymen to break, but never felt anything. First, their hips met, then they were belly to belly, then his chest pressed into her chest, and finally they were kissing as he bottomed out his cock, pressing his groin into hers. Trixi lifted her legs around his waist, and wrapped her arms around his neck, his tongue dueling with her own.</p>
<p>Keeping their chests pressed together, Mark began stroking in and out of Trixi&rsquo;s vagina. She closed her eyes and focused on the incredible sensations of his cock moving in and out of her vagina &hellip; her vagina! She was deliriously happy. The warm sand on her back felt wonderful, and she let her body rock into the sand&rsquo;s soft embrace. After several minutes of the most intense pleasure she ever felt without actually climaxing, she began to see colors swirl behind her eyelids. She opened her eyes, and watched as Mark lifted himself up a little bit, increasing the pace of his strokes.</p>
<p>She began to whimper with each stroke, feeling her body build a delicious tightness in her groin that moved in waves across her body. Her breasts were rocking back and forth, as Mark pounded into her. She was screaming with passion, her womb was beginning to tense up and the waves built in intensity and frequency.</p>
<p>Homa and Binah turned their heads from their own sixty-nine to watch the beauty and strength the two lovers exhibited. Even Homa felt forced to admit that Trixi was not merely having sex, but what she and Mark were engaged in was compelling, sexy, and she felt her own passion rise unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why am I feeling so &hellip; so &hellip; &quot; Homa wondered as she felt her breasts tighten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horny?&rdquo; asked Binah, her own eyes glowing as she watched Mark pump in and out of Trixi. &ldquo;Because they are beautiful, and we can see how happy Trixi is,&rdquo; she said as she stroked Homa&rsquo;s full breasts, feeling how swollen her breasts were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if &hellip; if &hellip; &quot; Homa said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to do anything,&rdquo; Binah reassured her, suspecting that it was only a matter of time before the mermaid milk did it&rsquo;s work on healing both Homa&rsquo;s body and her mind. &ldquo;No one will force you to do anything. Do you want to get closer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trixi turned and sensed Binah&rsquo;s question, even in the haze of her own passion, and let one hand drop from Mark&rsquo;s shoulder to wave them over to her. She let her hand rest on the sand as she turned back to Mark, watching the sweat build on his brow as his hips kept forcefully but still slowly hammering into her. She was nearing her first orgasm, but something seemed to be in the way, something holding her back. Mark was watching her face, trying to match his pace with her responses, building her up slowly.</p>
<p>Homa picked up her outstretched hand and brought it to her lips, kissing it, while Binah settled down on the sand on her other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it like?&rdquo; Homa asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful &hellip; ahhhh &hellip; it really &hellip;. Oh, my &hellip; god &hellip; really is wonderful,&rdquo; she gasped as her body tensed even further.</p>
<p>Trixi brought Homa&rsquo;s hand to her own and sucked on her fingers, moaning and whimpering as Mark increased his speed. The wet sounds of their hips slapping together filled the night air, mixing with the gentle sounds of the surf along the shore. Mark paused, put one arm around Trixi&rsquo;s slender waist, and pressed her to his crotch. He lifted her hips as he sat up and brought his own knees under her ass. His cock pressed up into her G-spot, and Trixi groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift her up onto your laps,&rdquo; he told the two other women. &ldquo;Hold her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Homa eagerly slid her own legs under Trixi&rsquo;s shoulders as Binah slid hers under Trixi&rsquo;s waist. Together they formed a bed of bodies over the sand. Mark began to stroke again, starting with long slow strokes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss me,&rdquo; Trixi said, and reached for Homa&rsquo;s dark, curly hair.</p>
<p>Homa leaned over, feeling her breasts brush against Trixi&rsquo;s large endowments, and pressed her lips to hers. They licked each other&rsquo;s lips, stroked their teeth, and chewed on each other&rsquo;s tongues. Mark increased his speed, and Trixi rocked back and forth with the force of his thrusts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh &hellip; it&rsquo;s so, soo &hellip; good,&rdquo; she whimpered, opening herself to her lovers, her legs spread wide as Mark drove into her, pounding, pushing, slapping, slipping in and out. Binah stroked her breasts, tweaking her nipples, and Trixi felt the bloom of her long awaited orgasm flower within her. She grabbed Homa&rsquo;s face, lifted it from her own, and held her gaze, watching Homa&rsquo;s face watch hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &hellip; love &hellip; youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh,&rdquo; Trixi screamed as Mark&rsquo;s hips moved like a whirlwind and the damn within her womb broke.</p>
<p>Homa watched with fascination as Trixi&rsquo;s face contorted with such beauty and such agony that she could not turn away. She brought her hands up to Trixi&rsquo;s, feeling her grip her face as she convulsed in her orgasm. Trixi&rsquo;s eyes were still open, but Homa was sure she wasn&rsquo;t seeing anything other than an explosion of color and light. Mark felt Trixi clamp down on his cock, and he thrust in as hard as he could and held his cock there for several seconds until he could no longer hold back, his own orgasm finally arriving. He roared out into the night as his seed splashed hotly within her, lifting her again into the very apex of pleasure as his splashing cock set off another orgasm within her quaking womb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was incredible,&rdquo; Binah said, her own breathing heavy and quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; Homa said with surprise in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ummmmererrrangioumphfffff,&rdquo; Trixi said.</p>
<p>Everyone but Petra and the children bobbed in the waters of the Moon Pool, twenty-eight mers, six of whom were either pregnant or had already delivered. Joy and Mac were in the lab cave, making several radio calls, and generally avoiding the Moon Pool during transition.</p>
<p>Mark and his girls were still on the beach, and Petra and the children played together in the corner where they kept food for these transformations. Between Petra and the other mers, at the edge of the pool, Esmée stood shaking. From the water, Wong, Shen, and Lin all beckoned to her, each of them having already transformed. Wong was supposed to go last, but Esmée seemed gripped by an unexpected fear of both the water and the transformation, and Wong volunteered to go before she did. Now, it was her turn.</p>
<p>It was over in a matter of minutes for the mermaids. Wong took a little longer than Shen or Lin because all the males exited the pool for merman transitions. Lin, who had twenty-six mers to feed from and the same number helping her mentally focus on the change, completed her transformation in only thirteen minutes. The &ldquo;pool in the pool&rdquo; was for Esmée to take only between seven to ten minutes, if she would ever get into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esmée,&rdquo; Wong reassured her. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t hurt, and it is over in minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wong&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Shen said, her silver voice and shinning eyes enticing Esmée to overcome her irrational fears. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine. Don&rsquo;t you want to be with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she gasped, holding her hand over her chest, fighting down her panic. &ldquo;Just give me a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat and Phoebe shared a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esmée, take your time,&rdquo; Pat urged. &ldquo;We want to compare some notes anyway. Why don&rsquo;t you sit down and collect yourself, and when you&rsquo;re ready, you let us know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esmée nodded and sat down near the edge of the pool, her future podmates leaping from the water to join her. She sat, shivering and naked among them. Wong&rsquo;s silver and gray tail was just like his brother Tuo&rsquo;s, with white highlights. Wong retained all of his Oriental features, unlike Tuo who had been slightly &ldquo;Jason-ized&rdquo; during his transition. Shen and Lin both had dark red tails, but Shen&rsquo;s highlights were silver and Lin&rsquo;s were golden. They were still recognizable as sisters, but not identical like Dawn and Sandi or the triplets. Esmée leaned against Wong, feeling his strength flow from his body, and ran her hands along his beautiful tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be O.K.,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is just my age old fear of water. I was fine yesterday. Je suis désolé.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry,&rdquo; Shen urged. &ldquo;Vous serez bien, ma fille douce. We&rsquo;re not going anywhere without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat, Galina, Alexis, Phoebe, Emma, Sally and Eric gathered in a corner of the pool to share reports. The scientific mers among them had rigged several sensors in the pool, and even though they were still participating in the ceremony of change itself, they were observing the process scientifically as well. They recruited Eric for his special sensory perception that had proved adept at understanding complex scientific processes and ideas that he really did not yet know much about. They had already discussed some of their findings and hypotheses between earlier transitions, but there had not been much time.</p>
<p>As their conversation progressed, other mers began to listen. The pool was filling with siren cell symbiotic bacteria, krill, and other microorganisms, and Pat and the others were able to see their functions for the first time. The microorganisms caused the transforming mers to spin, they provided some additional biomass for the tails they grew, and they leached the waste secreted by the attacking siren cells.</p>
<p>Alexis surmised that they also increased the effects of the bioelectrical influences, and that the siren cells were behaving like reverse stem cells of a sort. As the siren cells built up in the soonto -be-mermaid&rsquo;s body, they started to change, differentiating themselves for specific tasks. Some focused on attacking bone or tissue, others became transporters, and others became builders, using the resources provided by the first two to rebuild or create new bones, tissues, and organs.</p>
<p>Eric explained that it was like watching a glowing, &ldquo;living mermaid,&rdquo; with each layer of the body visible as the siren cells changed, attacked or built, and then were themselves expelled from the body as the new mer began producing his or her own siren cells. The process moved through the body along the already established body systems, sometimes one system at a time, like skeletal; sometimes combined with two or more, like endocrine, lymphatic, and circulatory; and sometimes the entire body was lit up, according to Eric, like a holiday tree as siren cells worked throughout the body at once.</p>
<p>Galina hypothesized that the final shimmering of light and ecstasy, a moment in which Eric described highly compressed waves of siren cell activity throughout the body moving from the core outward, was when their newly created DNA stabilized. The microorganisms that surrounded the new mer consumed the excess siren cells, causing the orgasmic like feeling.</p>
<p>Pat joked that Eric&rsquo;s special talents made an electron microscope obsolete, though neither Alexis nor Galina were willing to give up on eventually securing one for their lab. Pat also argued that the change could eventually happen in as little as one or two minutes. If enough siren cells were at work, all at once, the speed of the change ameliorated trauma to individual cells making mers very quickly.</p>
<p>The conversation stopped as Esmée stepped towards the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; she said with some conviction.</p>
<p>She held Shen&rsquo;s and Lin&rsquo;s hands, and the three of them dove into the pool. The mers quickly reassembled into their circle, and Esmée swam to Shen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You who saved me, give me my tail,&rdquo; she said with some difficulty, her gills still not fully developed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; Shen said simply, and pulled Esmée to her chest.</p>
<p>When Esmée switched to Shen&rsquo;s other breast, she felt the pressure for air in her chest decrease. With each new mermaid or merman, Esmée began to feel more and more confident, and less and less afraid. The amazing feelings caused by the radical build up of siren cells in her body was both healing and enervating. By the time she made it around the circle back to Wong, her body was glowing with power and energy. Esmée was barely able to hold back the power of the mermaid milk that engulfed her body. She felt the mental force of the mers around her help her keep it in check.</p>
<p>Pat watched with some concern as Esmée made her way around the pool. At first she was concerned for the girl&rsquo;s mental state, but as the power of the siren cells built within her slender body, Pat worried that the pool itself was amplifying the cells' power, and that Esmée would not be able to &ldquo;control&rdquo; the change. She could feel the small proto-mermaid struggling to hold back the change, and she added her focus to that effort. Pat looked around the pool, and saw several other mermaids with their brows furrowed in concentration, fighting to maintain control of the forces everyone could feel building in the center of the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wong &hellip; give &hellip; me &hellip; my &hellip; tail &hellip; &quot; she said, her body rigid and stiff, Shen and Lin stroking her legs as they pointed towards the bottom of the pool.</p>
<p>Wong pushed himself towards the beautiful girl, her dark eyes fluttering with her physical and mental effort to hold back the change. His cock, stretched out before him, extendied nearly twelve inches into the water, and nearly two and a half inches in diameter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
<p>The second that her lips touched his cock, he erupted into a massive orgasm, pumping great gobs of semen into her mouth. Esmée swallowed the first spurt, felt the second one strike her face, even with the water to slow it down, and by his third squirt, the microorganisms had her in their grasp, and she was spinning towards the center of the pool. She relaxed her grip on the siren cells within her body, and immediately a great force gripped her, and shook her body again and again. Her arms were pulled straight out from her shoulders as convulsions rolled through her.</p>
<p>The force of her release pulled her legs from Shen and Lin&rsquo;s grasp by, merging them almost immedately, lengthening, and changing as billions of siren cells rushed to do their work. Her tail was fully formed in minutes, flesh colored, with two sets of new fins extending from her hips and knees. Her hair had lengthened down below her hips, and floated about her in great halo of silky brown light, spiraling as she twisted in the water.</p>
<p>In seconds, blue scales swept up her tail, but her fins turned a bright red, and white highlights sparkled along her fins, flukes, and dorsal ridge. Suddenly a great shudder twisted through her body, and in less than seven minutes, it was over. Esmée was a mermaid.</p>
<p>It had taken her nearly four times as long just to drink from everyone in the circle.</p>
<p>Petra took one last look at the sleeping children nestled into the corner of the Moon Pool Cave, feeling the familiar feeling of lust rise in her body after the new pod transitioned.</p>
<p>Why do I feel always feel this urge for sex after a new pod is created, Petra wondered as a shiver ran up through her body. She knew how and why the mers controlled actual contraception, so why would everyone have this urge to &hellip; like &hellip; spawn, she asked herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the kids alright?&rdquo; Danni interrupted Petra&rsquo;s musings, popping her head above the water, her own face flushed with desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are sleeping,&rdquo; Petra said. &ldquo;Are you as horny as I feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Definitely, but I had to check on the kids,&rdquo; Danni said. &ldquo;Damn, it feels like estrus,&rdquo; she groaned, running her hands over her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Estrus?&rdquo; asked Petra as she waddled towards the water, her large breasts swinging provocatively as she made her way to the pool&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Galina about it,&rdquo; Danni said. &ldquo;She used to study estrus cycles in fish, you know where they can&rsquo;t help themselves and have this great orgy of sex to procreate. Since we actually control our own conceptions, maybe this sex urge is linked to the creation and maintenance of our mer-bonds rather than offspring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Petra nodded, and felt her breasts flush with sexual desire, her very large nipples stiffening in the cool air of the cave. &ldquo;That makes sense to me. Are you going to watch the kids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get back down to John, Pat, and Phoebe,&rdquo; Danni said, breathing heavily. &ldquo;The kids will be alright. The same thing that affects us makes them sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will happen when they get older?&rdquo; Petra wondered aloud. &ldquo;Who is going to have sex with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Danni said with difficulty. &ldquo;But I know who I am going to have sex with right now,&rdquo; she finished as she ducked back under the water.</p>
<p>Danni barely noticed Petra as she slipped past her on her way to her own pod, so full was the Moon Pool, charged with the residual power of the siren cells and the mounting sexual tension in all the mers. Wong&rsquo;s new pod was in the center of the pool, surrounded by a slowly growing cloud of white mermaid&rsquo;s milk. She could see Esmée&rsquo;s French tri-color tail flashing with lights as it wrapped around Wong&rsquo;s strong sliver and gray one. The Chin sister&rsquo;s dramatic red tails twirled around both, each sister perched on one of Wong&rsquo;s pelvic fins. Danni reached out with her mer-senses and &ldquo;found&rdquo; her own pod. She swam over to them, feeling the water caress her body as she sensuously swam through the pool, twisting around and between the various pods, all of whom were making love.</p>
<p>John hung in his usual spot at the north apex of the pool, and Pat already had his cock buried deep inside her body. Phoebe was beckoning to Danni, inviting her to her spot on John&rsquo;s right pelvic fin. Danni pushed herself quickly to her pod, feeling their shared, invisible connections jump with intensity as their physical bodies all made contact. John turned and kissed her deeply as she pressed her own swollen vent onto his fin. She moaned into the kiss, feeling the pleasant buzzing of his fin seep into her body, stimulating her clit, and making her hips twitch with pleasure.</p>
<p>Phoebe reached around both Pat and John and grabbed Danni&rsquo;s pelvic fins, using that leverage to pull everyone closer to John&rsquo;s quivering body. Danni gasped as she felt her vent mash down on John&rsquo;s hip, his fin oscillating like a buzz saw along the crease of her vent. She could feel Pat&rsquo;s internal muscles milking John&rsquo;s cock, her tail rolling with regular contractions as Pat&rsquo;s orgasm approached. John put his arms around Phoebe and Danni&rsquo;s necks and brought their faces all together. They shared a pod kiss, all four of them kissing, nipping, licking, tongues, lips, and teeth all mixed together as their bodies raced towards a shared, quadraphonic orgasm.</p>
<p>Danni felt one of her long nipples poking John&rsquo;s hard chest while her other pressed into one of Pat&rsquo;s enormous breasts. Danni could feel her milk building, swelling, pushing out her breasts until finally John&rsquo;s fin triggered the orgasm she desired. She moaned and spurted milk into the water, shooting thick streams of white into their tangle of limbs, fins, and tails. Phoebe pulled sharply on her fins, pressing each of them harder onto John&rsquo;s body, and both Pat and Phoebe joined Danni in orgasm, three complete sets of mermaid breasts all spurting milk into the water at once. Finally, John could take it no longer, and still holding all three of his mermaids together in a group kiss, began to pump his passion into Pat&rsquo;s quivering womb. After several long pulses, everyone calmed down and relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, we needed that,&rdquo; Pat sighed. &ldquo;Having kids cuts down on mer sex life, that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, you needed that,&rdquo; Phoebe giggled, pointing to where John&rsquo;s still stiff cock lay buried in Pat&rsquo;s now satisfied body. &ldquo;I need it, and I&rsquo;m sure that Danni needs it too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, right,&rdquo; Pat said, reluctantly pushing herself off John&rsquo;s cock, watching it pop out, trailing a silky string of semen from her vent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get that,&rdquo; Danni said, lowering her head and sucking the strand in like spaghetti,</p>
<p>An hour later, when John&rsquo;s pod went to check on the kids, none of them had yet awoken. As they looked back into the Moon Pool, they saw that Wong&rsquo;s pod was still in the center of the pool, still twisting behind a thick cloud of white mermaid&rsquo;s milk that flashed with color and light, and that even in the cave, they could still hear his mermaids screaming out their passion in several different languages.</p>
<p>Trixi watched with astonishment as thirty-six mers swam up onto the beach in the late morning sun, thirty-six mers plus Joy and Mac, who were being &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; by Eric&rsquo;s pod. The rush of color, power, grace, and the silvery sound of the mer voices filled her senses. Eric and Liga each pushed one of Mac&rsquo;s feet, while Sally and Alexis pushed Joy. Unknown to Mark&rsquo;s proto-pod, Mac and his daughter&rsquo;s pod had decided to put on a show.</p>
<p>Starting just inside the reef, Joy and Mac ducked under the water and then burst upwards a few meters further towards the beach, twirling into the air as their mers stayed at the surface, pacing the humans who sailed above them in the air. Joy and Mac arched back into the water together, and then rose to their surfing positions after only a few meters, the mers seamlessly joining them on their way to the beach. Again they leapt into the air, and both Mac and Joy performed &ldquo;almost&rdquo; graceful forward summersaults, laughing when they reemerged with their &ldquo;team&rdquo; pushing them from behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; Trixi shouted. &ldquo;That was so cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; Homa agreed, her head leaning on Mark&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it again!&rdquo; Trixi urged.</p>
<p>Most of the other mers stopped in the shallow water to watch as Mac, Joy, and Eric&rsquo;s pod put on a show for everyone. They performed many tricks; the last was a veritable fountain of mers and humans as Eric pushed Mac and Alexis (being the largest mermaid in her pod) pushed Joy, Sally and Liga came around from behind. Mari did her own tiny flip in front of the &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo; of bodies suspended in the air: two humans and five mers all spinning in the air at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; Homa shouted as the show ended and everyone headed for the beach. &ldquo;God, I can&rsquo;t wait to be a mermaid. They are so powerful and beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kinds of mermaids do you want to be?&rdquo; Mark asked his girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ever kind you want,&rdquo; Trixi answered. &ldquo;You did great with the woman part of the deal,&rdquo; she finished as she ran her hands over her glorious breasts again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Homa, how about you?&rdquo; Mark asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to be a Phoenix,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to be a bird?&rdquo; Trixi asked, dropping her breast from her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not literally,&rdquo; Homa said giggling. &ldquo;I want to be reborn; I don&rsquo;t want to look anything like I have been. My name means &ldquo;phoenix bird&rdquo; in Farsi, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love the way you look,&rdquo; Trixi complained. &ldquo;I love your hazel eyes, flecked with gold, and I love your body. Please don&rsquo;t change those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you &hellip; I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But for him,&rdquo; she continued playfully poking Mark in the chest, &ldquo;I need something to remind him that he&rsquo;s not in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A phoenix is a bird of fire,&rdquo; Binah said. &ldquo;You should have a tail of fire to match your eyes of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what kind of mermaid I want to be,&rdquo; she agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; Mark said, grinning. &ldquo;That will remind me that you cannot be touched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can touch me,&rdquo; Homa said, suddenly fearful and childlike. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I could ever let any man touch me again. But after last night &hellip; I &hellip; I &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say anything, my little firebird,&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;A promise is a promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a new promise,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, wait until next week,&rdquo; Mark said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t need to wait until next week,&rdquo; Homa argued. &ldquo;The mermaid&rsquo;s milk has done its work, inside and out. I&rsquo;m not frightened by you any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about him,&rdquo; Mark asked, pointing to the approaching human walking up the beach.</p>
<p>Homo looked at Mac, still powerful and handsome at sixty, and then back at Mark, who now looked barely twenty-five years old. She involuntarily shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me,&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;You can release me from the promise not to touch you without your invitation some day, but not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears sprang into Homa&rsquo;s eyes as she realized that even though she wanted to release him, needed to release him, she shouldn&rsquo;t release him. She wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;better&rdquo; yet. His insight and his tenderness compounded her frustration with her own wounds. Mark WAS someone she could finally trust, and she wanted to, but he was right, dammit. Her body and memories still wore the scars of her previous life. She buried her face into his chest and sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so &hellip; so sorry,&rdquo; she wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so, so, glad that Joy picked you to be our mate,&rdquo; Trixi said, as she brushed a tear from her own cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Binah said, putting her hand on Homa&rsquo;s shoulder as the much shorter girl sobbed. &ldquo;Me too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to look at her soon-to-be-pod-mate, matching his even gaze. &ldquo;I will be happy to be your mermaid, any mermaid, as long as I&rsquo;m yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will all be each other&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Mark said, enfolding all three of them into a gentle hug. &ldquo;No one will be mine any more than I will belong to each of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all squeezed in a group hug, and then they relaxed and encouraged Homa to pull herself together. The mers all salamandered up onto the beach, except for Danni and Petra who stayed in the shallow water to watch the children. Homa was still wiping tears from her eyes when Pat approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Pat said as she noted Mark&rsquo;s arm around Homa who was seeking comfort in his arms. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see some things have changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some things have really changed,&rdquo; Rose said as she saddled up next to Trixi. &ldquo;You look great! How do you feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;GREAT!&rdquo; Trixi squealed as she bent down to hug her mermaid mentor. &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t understand how finally becoming a mermaid will improve anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s why I give the advice,&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;No one would ever believe it without experiencing it for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have to be off,&rdquo; Mac said, turning to his daughter. &ldquo;You keep well, keep your head down, and I&rsquo;ll see you in a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long,&rdquo; Sally asked plaintively, her royal blue tail twitching with anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t know, Sally Su-Su,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;We have much to set in motion, but fortunately, you already own this island and &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do?&rdquo; Eric interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several smaller atolls nearby,&rdquo; Joy finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a partnership of John Ackerman, Dawn Halbst, Trevor Green, Tuo Guo Han, and Hank and Janice Connor own this island and four nearby atolls,&rdquo; Pat added. &ldquo;We talked to Hank and Janice via short wave this morning. Congratulations everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After everyone stopped hugging and crying, Pat added, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not out of the woods yet, but this was a big step. Mac and Joy will try to get the next steps accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so few people on the partnership?&rdquo; Eric asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, some of us no longer legally exist,&rdquo; Pat explained waving at herself and Danni. &ldquo;Second, You and Sally were excluded for a bit as we try to keep Mermaid Island below the radar. We took a chance with Tuo, because he worked for Malaki through his son Manalo, but we&rsquo;re betting that Malaki will never know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he is now a dolphin,&rdquo; Mac said, laughing. &ldquo;A fucking female dolphin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac!&rdquo; Joy said, scandalized. &ldquo;The children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re building a whole new society out here, and I for one hope we don&rsquo;t get hung up on particularly useful and flexible words like fucking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never hear you say it,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;Well, except for then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The opportunity never arose,&rdquo; Pat said, giggling at her own double pun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, well we best be off,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;Saly, Eric, may we request one last ride back out to the plane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat watched as the six figures ambled towards the water. Mac stopped their progress before they got to the water and took Eric and Sally aside. He whispered something into their ears, and when he had finished, Sally shrieked, hugged, and kissed him. Pat smiled to herself, suspecting what Mac had shared with her daughter. If only her brother could be so accepting, she thought wistfully; it would almost make up for the awful memories of her father.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, Binah and Mark sat at the edge of the Moon Pool, watching Homa make her way around the circle below. Danni and the kids were nearby, also watching the amazing transformation. Trixi had gone first, and was now a beautiful mermaid with a blue and yellow striped tail with solid blue fins and flukes with yellow highlights. Her golden blond hair curled around her head like a benign Gorgon. Homa had just finished feeding, her arms outstretched as her body began to spin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is amazing,&rdquo; Binah said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Mark agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never get tired of watching,&rdquo; Danni agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will happen to my hair?&rdquo; Binah asked, pulling at her thick and lustrous Afro that bushed out from her head. &ldquo;It would have to be ten feet long to cover my gills, and who could swim with that kind of hair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are beautiful,&rdquo; Mark answered, kissing her firmly. &ldquo;But you have a point about your hair. Mermaids need to keep their gills covered, and your hair doesn&rsquo;t relax for very long. What kind of hair do you want? We can change it you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Binah said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only one here from Africa, and so I want to represent, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; Mark agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that either you or the siren cell will come up with something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really think I&rsquo;m beautiful?&rdquo; Binah asked, looking down at her tall and slender body. &ldquo;You made Trixi, but I haven&rsquo;t changed much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t need to change,&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;A man may love to eat fish, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that he also doesn&rsquo;t love to eat steak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trixi is right,&rdquo; Binah said, kissing him again. &ldquo;You are special. Why aren&rsquo;t there more men like you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kinda hope that I am the only me,&rdquo; Mark said, stroking her ebony cheeks. &ldquo;I would hate to have to share you three with anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have to share you with each other,&rdquo; Binah said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, but I don&rsquo;t get to share me with another me,&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;Not that I want to &hellip; or that there is anything wrong with homosexuality. Oh, this is stupid. You are beautiful! Trixi is beautiful, and Homa is beautiful; and the three of you could not be more different from one another. Nevertheless, I know I am the luckiest guy here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think MuSu is the luckiest guy here?&rdquo; Binah teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To each man, his own meal,&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;I will be yours and theirs for as long as you&rsquo;ll have me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll make a good mer,&rdquo; Danni observed.</p>
<p>They all looked down to see Homa shudder through her final release. She was finished, her tail a stunning mix of fiery reds and oranges, with flaming golden highlights along her fins, flukes, and dorsal ridge. Her long brown hair still curled tightly down her back. As she pushed herself towards the surface, it reached halfway down her tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how her hair is both curly and covers her gills?&rdquo; Mark noted. &ldquo;Maybe you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to sit on the beach,&rdquo; Binah noted, pointing to her bushy hair that only fell to her shoulder blades as she sat on the edge of the pool. The bright pink of her still new gills extended another foot below. &ldquo;I would fry my gills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think of something,&rdquo; he reassured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn,&rdquo; Homa said in her new silvery voice, her hazel eyes practically blazing with golden light.</p>
<p>Binah smiled and stood up, stretching and wiggling her toes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be the last time I do that,&rdquo; she noted.</p>
<p>She arched into the water as Homa took her place next to Trixi, all the other mers except for Danni, who was with the children this time, surrounding the edge of the pool. With thirty-one mers in the water, they could all extend their arms in both directions and touch one another&rsquo;s fingertips.</p>
<p>Binah&rsquo;s dark body glowed in the afternoon sunlight, and as she made her way around the circle, Mark found himself pacing. It took her forever to make her way back to Homa, and when she finished, the Moon Pool seemed alive with power as her body twirled, and bubbles surrounded her quickly morphing body. That hadn&rsquo;t happened before, Mark thought. The water seemed to be boiling around the convulsing body of Binah, bubbles rising to the surface of the water, popping into the air of the cave, bursting with tiny &ldquo;poinks&rdquo; of sound.</p>
<p>It seemed as though Binah&rsquo;s transformation only took a few minutes, and suddenly she felt twisted into a circle and the bubbling water stopped as quickly as it had begun. She straightened out her body and pushed herself to the surface. Her long, dark hair streamed down to the middle of her dark red and orange-stripped tail, completely unlike Homa&rsquo;s bright, fiery tail. Binah&rsquo;s stripes looked tribal, and her black fringes along her fins and flukes matched her shiny ebony skin. Her sinewy body snaked its way upward, her slender hips had widened with her new mer-womb, and her breasts were now probably a C cup, where as before she was a healthy B. She smiled at Mark, her dark hair shimmering as the water leapt from its hydrophobic surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your turn,&rdquo; she said, crooking her finger.</p>
<p>Mark was about to jump into the water when Pat burst up on to the floor next to him. Phoebe, Emma, Galina, Alexis, and Eric followed. They all started talking at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see that?&rdquo; Emma gushed. &ldquo;The micro&rsquo;s started the most amazing chemical reaction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do the sensors say?&rdquo; Pat asked as Galina waddled over to a portable computer Shen had picked up in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Binah only took three minutes,&rdquo; Alexis said. &ldquo;Three minutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Mark said, trying to make sense of their excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; Phoebe added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nano-bubbles,&rdquo; Alexis said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nano-bubbles?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The siren cells in their bioelectric-ally agitated state create enormous instabilities in surrounding materials, like our bodies,&rdquo; Alexis hypothesized, thinking her way through this one. &ldquo;If the concentration was high enough, and some of them were extra, then they might start micro reactions in the water around the proto-mermaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Highly localized reactions that change the temperature of the water, forcing the gases in the water to be released in millions of tiny microbursts,&rdquo; Pat said, catching the drift of the argument. &ldquo;Each microburst releases a tiny amount of oxygen or carbon dioxide &hellip; &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those nano-bubbles form larger ones until it looks like the water is boiling,&rdquo; Emma said proudly. &ldquo;Even though the overall temperature of the water doesn’t rise, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Pat agreed. &ldquo;Now all we need to do is figure out what is happening in those micro-reactions. Is there anything in the sensors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Galina said. &ldquo;There is an increased activity among the microorganisms, but I can&rsquo;t tell you much more than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, what do you see?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>Eric turned to the pool and closed his eyes, after a moment, he twisted and hunched his tail forward, dipping his flukes into the water. After a few moments, he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to be much greater energy in the water than before,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really see any individual microorganisms, but they seem to be coalescing into all kinds of shifting patterns. When I put my tail into the water, it felt like some of them came over and sort of &hellip; I don’t know &hellip; sniffed at me. Then they just left me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we have any fish in that tank that are still alive?&rdquo; Emma asked.</p>
<p>Danni looked over the edge of one of the storage tanks in the cave and said, &ldquo;One, but it&rsquo;s barely moving. It should be someone&rsquo;s dinner soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emma salamandered over to the tank, grabbed the weakly flapping sea bass, and returned to the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, tell us what happens,&rdquo; she said as she threw the fish into the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bunch of them are surrounding the fish,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Now new ones are coalescing around it, and now some new ones are penetrating the fish. The fish is getting better, but it isn&rsquo;t changing. No, it is, but I can&rsquo;t see how, but its signal has changed. It&rsquo;s starting to swim towards the tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emma ducked her head into the water and shouted at MuSu to catch the fish. He did, and returned it to her. She held it aloft, and it was flapping vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Moon Pool is now a different place,&rdquo; Pat observed. &ldquo;We need to be careful about who comes in here and why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will need to map out the spread of those microorganisms,&rdquo; Alexis said. &ldquo;And see how far they spread beyond the Moon Pool itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it is safe for Mark?&rdquo; Phoebe asked, glancing over at the former SEAL.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phoebe,&rdquo; Mark said firmly. &ldquo;Only my own death can keep me from joining my girls. So, if you will all kindly join me, I&rsquo;d like to get started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he jumped into the pool. The mermaids shared a glance, and rushed back to the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are and monitor things,&rdquo; Pat told Eric as she brushed past him. &ldquo;Keep your tail in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guys out of the pool,&rdquo; Alexis ordered as she swam to her spot on the circle, her eyes wide as she watched Mark like a hawk.</p>
<p>Mark seemed oblivious to any danger, even as the water around him began to sparkle with light. The mermen quickly rose from the pool, and Mark swam over to Binah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dark, African queen, will you give me my tail?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re glowing,&rdquo; Binah said in awe. &ldquo;Are you sure we should start this now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer the question,&rdquo; Mark said calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course!&rdquo; She answered. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark sank to her dark brown nipples and pulled one into his mouth. He felt the mermaid milk spill into his body, and he allowed some of his hidden fear to dissipate. He knew he was leaping into something unknown, but nothing would stop him from joining his girls. He quickly drained Binah and moved on to Homa.</p>
<p>Alexis gave him a penetrating look, but he smiled and turned to his soon-to-be-pod-mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My bright, passionate firebird, will you give me my tail?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh yes,&rdquo; Homa said, holding her breasts up for him.</p>
<p>Mark again felt the warm, sweet, and powerful milk course down his throat as Homa felt the deep stirrings of emotion that accompanied proto-mer-feeding. She cradled his head as he suckled at her breast like a baby. Soon he had drained her dry, and he could feel that the power of the milk was strong. He winked at Trixi and moved onto Pat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother mermaid, will you give me my tail?&rdquo; he asked, feeling the power of the siren cell build within his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my brave and foolish SEAL,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;I hope this works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it will work,&rdquo; Mark said confidently, as he lowered himself to her breasts.</p>
<p>As he approached her large breasts, he silently remarked to himself how similar they were to Trixi&rsquo;s breasts. But when he took the first squirt of mother mermaid milk into his mouth, he felt an unexpected power spike surge through his body. He groaned into her chest, and tried to pull away, but found he could not. Pat fought off the urge to orgasm, and tried to form the words &ldquo;get him off,&rdquo; but she could not. She gave Phoebe a look of pure panic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong; he&rsquo;s already starting,&rdquo; Phoebe said, pointing to his legs, already stiff and apparently merging. &ldquo;Help me stop him!&rdquo; she told Emma who was next to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, he&rsquo;s reading at the same levels as Binah did when she finished with Trixi,&rdquo; Eric said, dipping his head into the water. &ldquo;Whoa, dudes &hellip; this is intense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is intense?&rdquo; Phoebe demanded, sensing some power growing around Mark and Pat, as she and Emma tried to separate them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The microorganisms are going nuts,&rdquo; Eric said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him off her!&rdquo; Phoebe said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying!&rdquo; Emma said.</p>
<p>Pat&rsquo;s eyes betrayed a panic she couldn&rsquo;t voice, and Phoebe groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; Trixi said, as she moved over to Mark, and pressed her lips at the juncture where Mark&rsquo;s lips met Pat&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>Mark sensed something different, and recognized Trixi trying to kiss him. Her presence boosted his strength, and he pried his lips from Pat&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your tail, my love,&rdquo; Trixi said as she placed her own nipple into his mouth.</p>
<p>She immediately erupted into an orgasm, as the microorganisms began spinning both of them, locking the two of them together. Her one free breast spurted milk into the water, which seemed to fuel the microreactions that were already starting, and soon obscured both of them behind a rising wall of bubbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; Homa asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch closely!&rdquo; Phoebe said. &ldquo;You especially,&rdquo; she ordered Eric.</p>
<p>She need not have ordered, Eric had his eyes closed and was gripped by the visions he could see with the pool. Great waves of microorganisms moved through and around the two bodies, one a mermaid, and one a proto-merman. Most of the micro&rsquo;s moved through Trixi&rsquo;s body without effect, but Mark&rsquo;s body was wracked with convulsions and great waves of power. It looked like millions of tiny firecrackers all exploding throughout his body.</p>
<p>For Mark and Trixi, however, their experience was very different. They appeared caught in a time warp, or at least that is how they would later describe the experience.</p>
<p>Trixi snapped her eyes open (though it looked to the rest of the mers that she never opened them), and watched as her own mermaid milk shot into the water in slow motion. Hundreds of tiny sparks of light seemed to swarm over her milk, in a few seconds, it was gone, and then another slow-motion spurt of milk pulsed into the water. Another swarm of tiny lights enfolded the precious fluid, and then she could feel a warm breeze brush past her. She knew that she was not moving in &ldquo;normal&rdquo; time, and she turned to see where the breeze was coming from.</p>
<p>There was no breeze, she thought to herself, underwater. She noticed that from all directions, below, above, and all around, millions of tiny sparks of light swirled around her, catching her tail and her hair, moving them as though in a breeze. The swirling got stronger, and suddenly both she and Mark were spinning. She could see the shocked looks on everyone&rsquo;s faces as they slowly spun by, and everyone looked like they were moving in hyper slow motion. It was almost funny.</p>
<p>Mark pulled back from her breast, and smiled at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; he asked without any fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re changing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she indicated his legs, which were stitching themselves together as they watched.</p>
<p>Mark looked down and it seemed to him that his legs were bubbling, that his body was being massaged from within, and that invisible hands were rolling, bulging, and pushing out against his skin. He looked past Trixi at the faces of the other mers who were slowly spinning by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is different,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Trixi asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are hyper-aware, and probably in shock,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; Trixi said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This process, what is happening to us, is actually happening very quickly, oh &hellip; ouch &hellip; that hurt,&rdquo; he said as a convulsion rolled through his body. &ldquo;But our brains are processing everything at a super high rate of comprehension. So everything seems to slow down. Have you ever been in an accident before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; Trixi said, watching Mark&rsquo;s legs lengthen into the proportions of a merman&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like that,&rdquo; he continued, groaning as his body morphed. &ldquo;Time slows down, not literally, but it seems that way because our brains notice every little thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched as Mark&rsquo;s body absorbed billions of tiny sparks of light, and billions more oozed out of his torso and face. Mark&rsquo;s body seemed to waver, as though they were both looking at it through water, rather than in water, as siren cells and microorganisms surged through his body and the water around them. They watched as a wall of bubbles rose around them. It seemed to last for a very long time, and the bubbles seemed to move very slowly. Then Mark felt a great twist in his body, and his new tail rose behind him as his body arched backwards into a full circle as the bubbles disappeared.</p>
<p>To everyone else, both Trixi and Mark seemed frozen in the water, and then suddenly a wall of bubbles obscured everything. It lasted for only a minute or so, and then the bubbles disappeared, revealing Mark in the familiar circle of release, the sign of a finished mer. His black and purple tail shimmered with green highlights, his long sandy brown hair floating around his shoulders, and his steel blue eyes, bright and alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; he asked Trixi, reaching out to her and pulling her into an embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so,&rdquo; she said, her chest heaving, her body still reeling from the forced orgasm that ripped through her body. &ldquo;That was so strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long were we changing?&rdquo; Mark asked, looking around at the shocked faces of the mermaids that surrounded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a minute or two at the most,&rdquo; Phoebe said, her voice filled with shock and awe.</p>
<p>Binah rushed over to him, Homa right beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were so worried,&rdquo; Binah said. &ldquo;That was scary. Are you sure that you&rsquo;re alright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trixi, you were so brave,&rdquo; Homa said. &ldquo;And Mark you were so stupid. You should have waited for Pat and the others to figure out what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave you without your mate, your knight in shining armor?&rdquo; Mark said. &ldquo;Not a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a knight,&rdquo; Homa snapped. After a moment, she said, &ldquo;I just need you,&rdquo; and she wrapped her arms around both Trixi and Mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is everyone else alright?&rdquo; Phoebe asked, her arms around Pat who was slowly recovering.</p>
<p>Even as all the mermaids nodded, Phoebe reached out with her mer-senses and took stock of everyone&rsquo;s condition. They were all surprised, but no one seemed hurt, not even Mark and Trixi.</p>
<p>Suddenly the mermen plunged into the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell was that?&rdquo; John demanded, rushing over to Pat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re alright; everyone is alright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did the computer say?&rdquo; Galina asked Gabriel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is running the diagnostics right now, but we won&rsquo;t know the results for at least an hour,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn computers,&rdquo; Galina growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was strange?&rdquo; Phoebe asked Trixi. &ldquo;You said something was strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that. It seemed like we were in those bubbles for five or ten minutes,&rdquo; Trixi answered. &ldquo;Mark said something about shock and hyper alert brain functioning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is strange,&rdquo; Phoebe agreed. &ldquo;But we will have to talk about this after we all get rid of the sexual compulsions from the transition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel so strange,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; John asked. &ldquo;What does it feel like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel light headed,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Sort of dizzy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel horny?&rdquo; Phoebe asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Pat said languidly. &ldquo;I just feel strange &hellip; good strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get you out of this micro-infused water,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have all settled to the bottom of the pool,&rdquo; Eric reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see that?&rdquo; John snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can see that,&rdquo; Pat said languidly. &ldquo;He can, I trust him.&rdquo; She giggled. &ldquo;I feel high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, me too,&rdquo; Trixi said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t felt that way in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my god,&rdquo; Petra gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; asked Gabriel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so horny, way more than normal,&rdquo; she groaned, running her hands along her body. &ldquo;God, I need you NOW!&rdquo; She shouted at Gabriel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Pat agreed as she ran her hands over her body. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really, really horny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the changed pool,&rdquo; Alexis surmised. &ldquo;We are all going to be even hornier after a transition. Quick everyone back to your pods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within seconds, the pods were collapsing around their mermen, tails and bodies writhing with passion. It even affected Danni above in the cave, and she too plunged back into the pool, the children left sleeping on the cave floor.</p>
<p>Mark turned to his pod, his groin suddenly on fire with pain. He instinctively pulled on his new muscle, and freed his angry cock. It arched into the water, throbbing with need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God, it&rsquo;s never felt like that,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never looked like that,&rdquo; Homa whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to go first?&rdquo; Trixi asked, her own chest swelling with passion, her nipples feeling like two points of fire in the cool water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I?&rdquo; Homa asked, her body shaking with lust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Binah answered, and pushed herself onto Mark&rsquo;s quivering pelvic fin, immediately bursting into an orgasm. Her dark chocolate breasts spurted bright, white milk into the water.</p>
<p>Homa watched as Trixi pushed herself onto Mark&rsquo;s other fin, and began moaning as his fin buzzed along her swollen vent. She hung back, staring at her pod-mates as they made love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to ask,&rdquo; Mark said through gritted teeth, his cock aching with need. &ldquo;I promised. Please ask,&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Homa said, startled out of her trance. &ldquo;Please touch me! Please fuck me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark reached out firmly and guided Homa towards his cock. Binah reached over, recovering slightly from her orgasm, and guided his cock into Homa&rsquo;s vent. As soon as it was a little bit in, he grabbed both of her pelvic fins and pulled her all the way onto his cock. Together, they both exploded into orgasms. Trixi followed quickly and seconds later, Binah joined them. For a minute or more, all four of them shook and moaned as they shared their orgasms.</p>
<p>As the white milk slowly dissipated from the cloud that now surrounded them, Trixi murmured, &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s what I call mutual satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next afternoon, the pods gathered in the lab cave as Pat explained the findings they had discovered after analyzing the data from the recording sensors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pool is officially a change agent, all by itself,&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;We had better find a way to warn Joy and Mac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Sally asked, looking quickly at Eric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they may already been affected by the changed pool,&rdquo; Eric said slowly. &ldquo;And they could start changing at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be continued?</p>
