            <p>“That was so awesome,” was the first thing Amanda said when  they arrived back at Michelle’s place. “How you jumped out of this  burning house, with this girl in your arms, descending to the ground  like an angel.</p>
<p>I wish I had brought my camera, you should’ve seen  yourself there. No wonder they applauded you; you’re a natural  superhero.”</p>
<p>“You’re giving me way too much credit.” Michelle almost  blushed. “I was more concerned about me being naked than to check for  the child’s health.”</p>
<p>“I’d bet ten bucks that you made her invulnerable anyway, so  your lack of clothing WAS the bigger issue. Speaking of which, what the  hell is this stuff?”</p>
<p>Amanda pointed at the leotard that had appeared on Michelle’s  body. The fabric seemed to be a strange combination of spandex and  latex. It hugged her curves like a second skin which – given the fact  that it had grown out of her body – it actually was.</p>
<p>“I don’t really know, I thought about not wanting to be naked  and about the plans for a costume we had so far and somehow it  appeared.”</p>
<p>“So you mean it looks like how you want it to? Could you try to make it look different? Like blue perhaps?”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll try.”</p>
<p>Michelle already knew why exactly Amanda wanted her to try  blue. She had suggested red &amp; blue costumes based on Superman  earlier, so Michelle already expected that Amanda would demand the  diamond shaped S symbol next, if this worked. The super powered blonde  decided to do her friend this favor and imagined her wearing a blue  leotard with the super logo on it. While the costume normally consisted  of more than just a leotard, Michelle’s habit of levitating whenever  possible made the illusion of Supergirl – or a grown-up Superwoman –  complete.</p>
<p>“Oh my god.” Amanda gasped as she saw Michelle’s costume changing in color. “DC just called, they want their character back.”</p>
<p>“Hope you like it, because this is the only time I’m going to wear this kind of costume.”</p>
<p>“This is cool, how does it feel?”</p>
<p>“Just like before I changed it.”</p>
<p>“Not that, I mean in general. Is it comfortable or maybe even straining since it is part of your powers?”</p>
<p>“Actually, I still feel as if I’m wearing nothing.”</p>
<p>“You mean it’s an illusion?” Amanda grabbed a part of the  costume that now stretched away from Michelle’s torso. “No, it feels  quite real to me.”</p>
<p>“This is strange. It feels as if you were touching my skin. I could even share powers with you.”</p>
<p>“Wait, does that mean this costume is part of your body? Can you try to take it off?”</p>
<p>“Um… sure.”</p>
<p>Michelle began to take of the costume. She felt a little  awkward even though Amanda had seen her naked during her  transformation&hellip; maybe because Amanda had asked her to undress instead  of pleading her to put some clothes on.</p>
<p>Once Michelle had taken it off, she let it fall, only to have it dissolve in the air before reaching  the floor.</p>
<p>“So it seems like this costume can only exist with you.” Amanda  concluded while nonchalantly staring at her friend&rsquo;s exposed breasts.</p>
<p>This didn’t escape Michelle’s attention as she created a self-made tank top and panties to lessen her friend&rsquo;s ogling.</p>
<p>“Seems like creating a costume uses up a lot of super energy,” Michelle thought aloud. “This is rather strange.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I try to get a feeling about how much super energy I have  left. I was a little surprised at how little energy the rescue in the  burning house had cost me, when I compared my supply before and after.  So I was positive that creating a costume should use up just a little  amount of super energy.”</p>
<p>“So it takes more energy than you thought it would. What’s the  big deal? It’s not like you have to create a new costume every five  minutes.”</p>
<p>“That’s not it. Creating this tank top used up much more energy  than the whole child rescue did. Obviously the bigger leotard should  have used up even more, but didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you didn’t pay enough attention. You were stressed, weren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes but I clearly remember how much energy I had before that.  It’s as if somewhere along the line, my energy supply had been  refilled.”</p>
<p>“Or you just thought it took more energy when in reality it was just as easy as you expected it to be.”</p>
<p>“You mean, I misjudged the consumption just now?”</p>
<p>“You could try it again, just to be sure. We can’t really recreate the burning house situation after all.”</p>
<p>“Could it be that you just want to see me naked?”</p>
<p>“Wha…?” Amanda’s face turned red and she turned away. “You didn’t mind before…”</p>
<p>“But you did. Anyway, if I’m right this may be the last of my  super energy; if you’re right, it’ll take a little longer for me to turn  back.”</p>
<p>Michelle undressed once again, and her clothes dissolved once  she wasn&rsquo;t touching them anymore. Then she recreated the black leotard  that she had worn before. Unfortunately, her supply of super energy ran  out before she was finished which forced the fabric to dissolve  immediately as Michelle felt her transformation start to undo itself.  First, gravity reclaimed its reign over her, and her bare feet touched  the ground for the first time since she left the site of the burning  building. As soon as she landed on solid ground, her body shrank back  down to its prior state. Her athletic look disappeared as her muscles  shrank in size, giving her a slim appearance instead.  Her breasts  shrank down to their original A cups, a size more appropriate for her  body. As her vision got blurry, Michelle knew that her eyes had changed  to normal, and she didn’t even bother to look as she knew her golden  blonde hair had shortened and darkened to its original brown as well.</p>
<p>“And here I am plain old Michelle again,” she commented.</p>
<p>Amanda looked at her dumbfounded. Even though Michelle’s  transformation back to her mortal self was far less inspiring than the  transformation to her super self, the sight of a woman’s body changing  so fast in front of her eyes was still mesmerizing.</p>
<p>“Well that settles it, creating a costume uses up quite a bit of the super energy,” said Michelle.</p>
<p>She then left for her bedroom and returned a few minutes later, dressed in her pajamas.</p>
<p>“Actually, I don’t think I really understand what this super  energy is. You say that it’s used for each of your superpowers but it’s  hard to believe this. I just don’t see how the same energy can grant you  super strength and flight at the same time.”</p>
<p>“Ok, it’s a bit more complicated than that. From what I felt,  it’s like the super energy is the raw form, and when I use a power a  part of it gets changed into the kind of energy that is needed for this  power.”</p>
<p>“I see, so it’s not directly used for your powers but converted into something that is.”</p>
<p>“Yes, the normal human body doesn’t seem to be capable of  handling the raw energy. When I shared my powers with you, I had to  convert the energy beforehand so you could only use it for the very  purpose I decided.”</p>
<p>“Hm, if you can convert this energy so easily and are even able  to send it to another human body, maybe you can also convert a  different energy into super energy.”</p>
<p>“What kind of energy do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You know like the energy you consume through food, it’s measured in calories for a reason.”</p>
<p>“Maybe, but now that I’m normal we won’t find out.” Michelle yawned.</p>
<p>“It seems like we should call it a night.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Oh wait, I wanted to give you something.”</p>
<p>Michelle took out the backpack they had with them before and  took out the three vials with super serum. She offered them to Amanda.</p>
<p>“I know you don’t want to drink it yet, but just in case anything happens, I want you to have them.”</p>
<p>Amanda was awe-struck when she took the vials. She was holding  the greatest treasure she could think of. Still, her plan to wait until  the time was right was unchanged. After she thoroughly thanked Michelle  for the vials, she left to return home.</p>
<p>Michelle went straight to bed and fell asleep almost immediately.</p>
<p>In her dreams she relived the events after she accidentally  drank the potion that started it all. She recounted in detail the pain  she had felt right before she transformed from a plain brunette woman to  a stunning goddess with powers beyond her imagination. The dream  continued from her transformation to her first flight in a new world.  The experiments, learning about her invulnerability by crashing into a  mountain, lifting a boulder that no human could possibly lift, her first  tries to run with superhuman speed, her flight back, her masturbating  in her super body and finally her transformation back to a brunette  mortal – albeit an enhanced one.</p>
<p>She heard her own voice commenting, “Those were good times.”</p>
<p>Next, her dream showed her the second transformation. This time  she had wanted to impress Amanda with her new body and showed off her  transformation. Her second transformation felt several leagues better  than her first, but she kept her calm, and even when her flight powers  tried to lift her off the ground, she subdued them.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you follow your instincts to become airborne?” Again, her own voice asked this.</p>
<p>Michelle remembered her conversation with Amanda, from Amanda’s  refusal of drinking the potion to her planning a superhero career for  Michelle. The whole afternoon they waited before going out under the  cover of night.</p>
<p>“She declined such a wonderful gift, so why does she decide your actions?”</p>
<p>The young woman wondered if the voice was really hers, but she  felt herself whispering, “because she is right. I always wanted to make  the world a better place. I just had no idea how.”</p>
<p>She remembered the powerless feeling as she had to watch her  colleagues add oil to the fire when they broadcasted doomsday scenarios  about the meteor crash. With the powers she now possessed in her super  form, she could easily prevent this fear by stepping in front of the  camera and promising to protect the city at all costs.</p>
<p>Michelle suddenly stood in a blank space. Everything around her  was white, and she couldn’t make out whether she was in a white room or  just in a bright open space. The young woman realized that she had the  appearance she had before her very first transformation. Her plain form  and her lifeless hair that had disappeared after her transformation were  now reminding her of how even her normal looks had improved thanks to  the potion.</p>
<p>Michelle wasn’t alone in this white dream space. In front of  her floated a stunningly beautiful woman with golden hair and blue eyes.  This was the woman Michelle had become after drinking the potion, her  super alter ego so to speak. Both versions of Michelle were naked; a  fact that bothered the mortal Michelle to no end, even though she knew  this was a dream.</p>
<p>After a short silence, her super alter ego spoke.</p>
<p>“I see, you want to improve humankind. But there are complications, aren’t there?”</p>
<p>A vision of the rapist she had encountered earlier appeared  before her eyes. Michelle had picked that man up and thrown him away  like a bag of garbage. The man crashed onto the ground, breaking his arm  and maybe shoulder in the process.</p>
<p>The vision disappeared and the goddess before her continued.</p>
<p>“I can clearly understand why you rejected his advances. Scum  like him doesn’t have what it takes to mate with us. But if you want to  help humankind, how exactly did you help him here? Wouldn’t it have been  better for humankind if you got rid of this foul individual?”</p>
<p>Michelle was terrified by this suggestion. “Killing him isn’t  the solution, but after this experience, maybe he changes his behavior.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know for sure?”</p>
<p>“I don&rsquo;t. But in the future, I’ll go patrolling around town and if he didn’t change his ways, I will bring him to the police.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you do so in the first place?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to know about my powers first and preferred to keep a low profile.”</p>
<p>“But now our power has been exposed to others. We saved this child out of the fire.”</p>
<p>“And it felt good!”</p>
<p>The other Michelle smiled as she answered, “Indeed it did!”</p>
<p>Michelle opened her eyes in her still completely dark room. She  was surprised to be fully awake right away. In fact, she felt as if she  had slept for days. The strange dream she had was still vivid in her  memory. It was clear that this dream had a deeper meaning, but she  couldn’t tell what it was. The other version of her had been so  intimidating at first but she turned out to be curious after all. Was  she the symbol of the potion tampering with her mind? A  split-personality in the making? Or was she just an aspect of her  personality that had always been there? The young woman had no means of  finding out, so she could only continue like before.</p>
<p>Wondering why it was still dark in her room, Michelle looked at  her alarm clock to see it was 2 am. She had barely slept for more than  two hours! Since she felt so alive that she wouldn’t be able to sleep  for a long time, Michelle considered this to be yet another improvement  for her normal body. This was good for her plans to become a superhero,  as she would spend the day working and living a normal live while using  the whole night to patrol the city.</p>
<p>Michelle got up from her bed and took a long shower. Despite  her downright godlike appearance in her super form, she still cherished  the changes that were done to her mortal self. A few small improvements  had sufficed to make her significantly more attractive, and Michelle  gladly accepted the confidence boost that came with that.</p>
<p>Once she was done, Michelle wondered what to do next. A growl  from her stomach reminded her that breakfast was the best way to start a  day, even though it was 2:30 am. She realized that she had much more  appetite than normally, a fact that had escaped her attention yesterday.  Michelle didn’t really mind, she was sure this was a good thing, and  subsequently ate twice as much as she was accustomed to. Once she  was done eating, Michelle was reminded of Amanda’s words about  converting other energies to super energy. Michelle wasn’t too sure  about that. She frowned at how little she really knew about this strange  energy and how it enabled her to do all these insane feats. It was  strange; whenever she found out about a new power of hers, she could  already use it quite well. Michelle felt as if the knowledge of these  powers had been engraved into her mind. No, there was a proper term for  it: instinct. She instinctively knew how to use each power – at least  once she became aware of it. This meant her attempts to discover new  powers were doomed to fail from the very beginning. During her training a  few hours ago, she had just tried to manipulate the super energy to do  ‘something else’ which didn’t work at all. The real way would be to  actually know what she wanted to do – or at least think about it.</p>
<p>3 am in the morning wasn’t exactly the best time for Michelle  to be up already, as it was really boring. Granted, she didn’t really  have plans for the day to begin with. The only thing she wanted to do  was to transform and fly out on patrol – after sunset that is. While it  was still dark outside, Michelle was anxious to transform only a few  hours after her last transformation had ended. She remembered how Amanda  had compared her to a junkie before Michelle had proven that the potion  did indeed transform her into a super powered goddess.</p>
<p>It was indeed a possibility that she could become addicted to  the potion. This was why she intended to wait until evening to  transform, but it wasn’t even morning yet. Michelle had to admit that  she wasn’t as excited about becoming super as she had been before her  second transformation. Normally, an addiction would make her crave for  another dose of the potion, right? She thought about the implications.</p>
<p>The possibility of addiction or another side effect for not  waiting long enough; those were two arguments against taking the potion  now. It was Saturday night she had good chances of finding someone to  help. If there was a minimum time limit between taking the potion, she  would eventually have to test it out. After all, in the future there  might be a situation where she has to drink the potion short after her  last transformation, or maybe even while she was still transformed. Two  arguments on each side so in the end, she went with her gut. She was  bored and liked to be super, so she took a glass and milked the  mysterious plant in her room for a dose of the magic liquid.</p>
<p>Michelle looked at the glass of green liquid and thought about  her first two transformations. The first transformation had started  really painful, but felt better and better with each part of her that  shifted into perfection. The second transformation had been leagues  better than the first one, with the changes to her neural system being  pleasurable and all the changes on her body occurring practically at the  same moment, intensifying the pleasure each change brought. Michelle  was certain that these differences were caused by the fact that her body  had been changed to better handle this green liquid. Standing naked in  front of her full length mirror, Michelle drank it down.</p>
<p>It was very similar to her second transformation. She felt the  changes beginning in her mouth the moment the liquid had entered it and  felt them continue to her brain while the actual liquid was on its way  to her stomach. Michelle was just finished drinking when she already  felt her mind awaken and her vision becoming sharper and better than  humanly possible. It was clear that the transformation happened faster  than even the second time, but Michelle was still able to feel every  change happening on its own. In her mirror image she could see how the  super energy swept over her hair, elongating it and changing its color  to golden blonde. She could also feel the rest of her body changing, her  face becoming prettier, her arms, legs and torso becoming longer while  the muscles on them grew into slight definition while her breasts  practically exploded in size. Michelle felt each of these changes happen  and with them, she felt more pleasure than normal humans could ever  dream to experience. She rose into the air – naturally, as she didn’t  prevent it this time. After not even ten seconds her transformation was  complete.</p>
<p>Even after transforming twice before, Michelle couldn’t help  but smile from ear to ear as she saw her mirror image hovering above the  floor so casually, as if it was the most normal thing to do. Michelle  wondered why her transformation had happened even faster this time, but  shrugged it off as it meaning that she had grown accustomed to  transforming.</p>
<p>After admiring herself in the mirror for a while, Michelle  created herself the black leotard she had used before. She really needed  to think out her costume later that day. Michelle also created some  shoes. She was pretty sure that she couldn’t create a thick sole for  boots, not to mention that creating too much fabric would eventually  become a waste of her super energy. When it came to her, she would be  just fine continuing to fly around barefoot, but since it would look  pretty weird in the long run, she settled for some ballerinas. With her  provisory costume completed, Michelle flew out into the night.</p>
<p>Soon it became apparent that Michelle would need much patience  for her superhero career. Sure, there were several people outside going  home from whatever club they came from. Most of them would take a cab or  at least go home together. After half an hour of patrolling the skies,  Michelle found a young woman going home alone and entering a side road  where Michelle spotted some thugs. When the woman noticed them, she was  already surrounded.</p>
<p>“Look who came to visit us,” one of the men said – probably their leader. “A nice woman looking for some entertainment.”</p>
<p>The other men laughed. There were five of them including the leader.</p>
<p>The woman obviously knew in how much trouble she was, as she was taking a can of pepper spray out of her bag.</p>
<p>One of the men standing behind her took out a gun, pointed it at her and released the safety loudly before threatening her.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.”</p>
<p>“And here I wanted to say something very similar to you!”  Michelle said as she landed in between him and the woman and grabbed the  gun in his hand.</p>
<p>The gun went off and the bullet hit Michelle straight into her  right breast. Michelle had been totally sure that she was bulletproof,  and she was right in that assumption. She had also checked out the thugs  with her X-ray vision and knew that this was the only gun they  possessed. Therefore it had been the right choice to shield the woman  with her own body. What she had not taken into account was that her  breast was still an erogenous zone and that the impact of a bullet would  send an erotic pleasure through her body. For a second, she was lost in  this unexpected sensation and the man used it to fire another shot at  her – this time aimed at her forehead. He didn’t see or realize that the  first bullet had only aroused her, but he got a clear view of the  second bullet being flattened on her forehead and falling down without  causing any damage to her. The man was too shocked at this sight to  react to Michelle’s kick that sent him flying into the next wall,  knocking him out.</p>
<p>Michelle turned around to see that the woman had held her own  against the remaining four men. They obviously didn’t want to get hit by  the pepper spray. And now that they saw how their comrade was knocked  out by this strange newcomer, the thugs suddenly had a change of heart  as they turned around to run away. Five seconds later, Michelle had  knocked out every one of them. She had told her alter ego in her dream  that she would turn over this scum to the police, and she planned to  stick to that.</p>
<p>“Call 911, tell them we got some wannabe rapists here,” she ordered the dumbfounded woman.</p>
<p>The woman did as she was told, and the moment she turned back  to Michelle, she found that the superwoman had already left into the  air. From above Michelle watched the police take the woman&rsquo;s statement.  Of course, the police didn’t believe the woman’s story about a  mysterious superheroine beating them up and then suddenly disappearing,  but that shouldn’t be too much of a problem as long as they took in the  thugs.</p>
<p>While she was watching them, Michelle absentmindedly massaged  her right breast. The sheer pleasure of the bullet hitting her had  almost made her screw up. Only sheer luck had made the guy try to hit  her instead of the woman she had intended to save. Michelle decided that  she had to learn how to deal with these situations. Maybe self-defense  classes could give her the knowledge for that.</p>
<p>Michelle patrolled the city until dawn, but she found nobody  who needed her help. With all the couples she saw on the streets she  felt more like voyeur than a super heroine. She returned back home  feeling happy that she could help at least one person. Still, Michelle  couldn’t deny that she herself felt envious about those couples for  having found someone to go home with. Then again Michelle would have  much less trouble finding the right man for her than she had two days  ago. Soon Michelle’s thoughts travelled to what she would do with Mr.  Right once she had found him, and she started to masturbate above her  bed like she had done during her first transformation.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Thompson? This is Detective Jacob Spencer, remember me?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. How’s it going?”</p>
<p>“Sorry to call you on a Sunday morning, but I didn’t want to wait until you heard these rumors elsewhere.”</p>
<p>“What rumors?”</p>
<p>“About some kind of angel or superwoman or something like that.  There have been some cases where people swear to have seen a blonde  stunningly beautiful woman who can not only fly but is super strong as  well.”</p>
<p>James almost missed a red light after hearing this.</p>
<p>“You’re kidding, right?”</p>
<p>“No, James. There’s a giant of a man who claims to have been  beaten up by that woman for trying to rape her and trust me, he looks as  if he was hit by a bus. There was also another attempted raping that  was prevented by her if the witness is to be believed. She also seems to  have saved some child from a fire and was seen by a whole group of  onlookers as she flew away.”</p>
<p>“This sounds really strange.”</p>
<p>“You bet! Too bad I only heard rumors and have nothing that you  might be interested in, but if you want to interrogate the witnesses, I  could arrange that.”</p>
<p>“Just send me a copy of their statements and I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>James wondered if this had something to do with what he had  found in the mountains. In that case he actually had a good trail which  he would follow immediately.</p>
<p>“How about you? Working on an interesting case right now?”</p>
<p>“More or less,” Detective Spencer answered. “It’s about a Junkie prostitute who died of an overdose.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t really sound interesting,”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but when you look at her corpse, you start to doubt that  she was a junkie at all. She is way too good and healthy looking to  have the drug history she’s claimed to have.”</p>
<p>“A woman that looks too good and healthy? I didn’t know something like this existed.”</p>
<p>“Even her friends claimed that she suddenly looked far better  than before and looking at her older pictures, they’re right. That woman  was a mess. What’s more, the dose that killed her seems to actually  have been child’s play to her and could’ve been only lethal for someone  who had never taken that stuff.”</p>
<p>“Well, she either got one hell of a makeover or she was replaced by a similar looking woman. I’m betting on the latter.”</p>
<p>“They’re checking her DNA to what we found in her apartment as  we speak and her autopsy is running too. Actually, we found a great  amount of a woman’s hair in her trash. I’m betting that the real junkie  has just shaved her hair and is running around with a wig now.”</p>
<p>“Then all you have to do is find her and the case is closed.”</p>
<p>“Not exactly. This woman didn’t actually commit a crime, so  there’s no reason to search for her. It’s more about finding out who the  dead woman really is. Well, this is as interesting as it gets.”</p>
<p>They continued their chat for a little longer before James had  finally reached his destination. He still couldn’t believe that the  owner of the pajamas he had found in the mountains had been in the  database. According to her file, Michelle Jenkins had been part of the  TV news team that had promoted the meteor evacuation database and was  more or less forced by her colleagues to turn in a DNA sample. This  gained her some sympathy from James, who knew all too well how it felt  to be left doing the wet work for his colleagues. As most people in that  particular database were just hypochondriacs, Michelle Jenkins seemed  to be one of the few exceptions. Her picture on the other hand wasn’t  that impressive. James wasn’t the guy to be superficial, but the picture  he had seen showed a rather plain brunette where the rumor he had just  heard of described a blonde bombshell. Maybe he was just following a  dead lead. Still, he went up to her apartment and rang the bell.</p>
<p>Hearing the doorbell, Michelle had to chuckle about the irony.  Yesterday, if Amanda had come a little later, Michelle would have  already transformed into her super self. Now, she had just transformed  back to normal half an hour ago. She looked through the spyhole first –  oh boy, if this handsome guy had disturbed her during her little private  time, he would have been in for the surprise of a lifetime. Luckily she  was a bit more composed now, as she opened the door.</p>
<p>James was surprised by Michelle’s looks. He was sure this was  the woman he had seen on the picture in the database, the same brown  hair, the same facial structures and he was sure it was even the same  glasses she wore. But he had to admit, that the picture didn’t do her  justice. For some reason this woman was far more attractive – no,  beautiful – than he had expected.</p>
<p>“Yes?” Michelle broke the silence.</p>
<p>“Um … Miss Michelle Jenkins?”</p>
<p>“That’s me, yes.”</p>
<p>“My name is James Thompson. I’m working as a scientific  consultant for the police right now and I’d like to ask you a few  questions.”</p>
<p>Michelle was surprised that this guy was supposed to be a  scientist, but she was more alarmed by the fact that a scientist was  standing in front of her door.</p>
<p>“What kind of questions are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“It’s about some mysterious thing that happened in the  mountains in the night of Friday to Saturday. It may be just a big  prank, but it somehow points to you.”</p>
<p>“Ok, come in.”</p>
<p>As she led him to her living room, Michelle considered her  options. If this guy had traced her from her original trip to the  mountains, he sure as hell had the brains he claimed to have. Sending  him away would only make her look suspicious, especially since she  didn’t know what exactly had led him to her.</p>
<p>“So, what kind of prank are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“A boulder big enough that it can only be moved with special  equipment has been moved, with no traces of such equipment left behind.  It actually looks like it was carried by a person.”</p>
<p>“And what exactly leads you to me? I highly doubt I could carry that boulder you speak of.”</p>
<p>Michelle was bluffing, of course. She was pretty sure that this was the boulder she had tested her super strength on.</p>
<p>“Well, near the boulder I found this,” James said as he took out a plastic bag with pink rags inside. “Does this look familiar?”</p>
<p>Michelle forced herself to nod as casual as she could.</p>
<p>“I used to have a pajama like this, but I threw it away a week ago,” she lied.</p>
<p>“I see, that explains why your DNA was found in these clothes.  Do you have any idea who could have taken these out of your garbage to  leave a false trail to you?”</p>
<p>James was getting desperate. His only lead had been a prank on  its own, and he had little to no reason to continue this conversation.  Still, he somehow didn’t want to do that. This woman was strangely  fascinating to him, he barely could think straight in her presence. He  had actually planned to somehow lure her into revealing that she did  know something about the things in the mountains, but he had screwed it  up by being too honest with her.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t know of any particular person that would do that. But I have a question to you as well.”</p>
<p>“And what would that be?”</p>
<p>“Do you address all your questions' to women&rsquo;s feet?” Michelle teased.</p>
<p>James' face turned red the instant she said that.</p>
<p>“No, I’m… um there were footprints in the mountains and I was trying to see whether they could be yours?”</p>
<p>“So you still think it was me?” she half-joked.</p>
<p>“No.” James tried to sound as serious as he could now. “Your  feet are too delicate – I mean small.” James swallowed hard, clearly  showing his nervousness.</p>
<p>What the hell was wrong with him? He was acting like a teen boy  who was alone with a girl for the first time. James didn’t believe in  love at first sight, but this woman came dangerously close to making him  reconsider. Too bad it didn’t help him in his current case.</p>
<p>Michelle on the other hand enjoyed the effect she had on him to  the fullest. It was the first time in her life that a man was so  intimidated by her – and she wasn’t even in her super form right now.</p>
<p>“Well, I should get going.” James prepared to leave. “Thank you for your time.”</p>
<p>“It was my pleasure,” Michelle answered flirtingly while at the  same time being a little sad that this hot stud was running away.</p>
<p>James was already halfway on his way to the door, when he stopped and turned around.</p>
<p>“Oh one more thing: Would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Fred hadn’t expected a warm welcome when he arrived at his  ex-girlfriend’s apartment. He had cheated on her, she had found out, and  in the end he had lost both women. All that was left was the  confrontation with his now-ex-girlfriend which would result in him  giving back his spare key to her apartment and carrying his own stuff  out of it. All accompanied by them arguing, meaning that she would yell  at him while he remained silent. He was in the wrong here, and he didn’t  see any reason to sugarcoat it.</p>
<p>When Amanda opened the door, Fred expected her to start  throwing a tantrum. Instead she just glared at him and kept her calm.  Fred saw that his ex-girlfriend didn’t look too good right now. She  either had not slept enough or was getting sick, maybe both.</p>
<p>“Are you here to get your stuff? Took you long enough!” she said, without bothering to greet him.</p>
<p>Fred knew her well enough to know that she could act strong for  a long time. Still the rings under her eyes showed that most of it was  an act. He held out his spare key.</p>
<p>“And to return this one, actually.”</p>
<p>Amanda took it and opened the door further to reveal a box full of his stuff.</p>
<p>“The box itself is a little farewell gift,” Amanda said sarcastically.</p>
<p>Once Fred had taken his belongings, Amanda asked him.</p>
<p>“Do you have any last thing to say to me?”</p>
<p>Fred shook his head.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Well I actually have one last thing to say to you.”</p>
<p>She came closer to him as she said that, before slapping him straight across the face with all the strength she could muster.</p>
<p>Fred stumbled but didn’t fall. He had been surprised by the  force of her slap, considering how under the weather she looked. His  cheek burned and a red hand-shaped mark would appear right where she had  slapped him. Otherwise he was fine.</p>
<p>“You don’t look well. Please get some rest and take care of  yourself.” His words of goodbye sounded more mockingly than he intended  to. He may have broken her heart, but he wasn’t enough of an asshole not  to care for her health. Unfortunately…</p>
<p>“After everything you’ve done I don’t care for your sympathy. Now get lost!”</p>
<p>…Amanda didn’t take it that way. With this, he left.</p>
<p>And now she was alone. As soon as Amanda had closed the door,  tears started to fill her vision and she barely fought them back. She  had only found out yesterday that Fred had cheated on her, but now their  relationship was completely over.</p>
<p>She felt terrible right now.  The events of the day before had  taken a toll on her health in form of a cold. First she found out about  Fred, but then Michelle had told her about a discovery she had made.  Amanda remembered how her friend talked like a drug addict about her  first trip, not believing that her friend really had transformed into a  super powered amazon. But when Michelle had demonstrated the effects,  Amanda witnessed her friend turning into a full-fledged goddess. She had  never seen a woman of such beauty in her life, couldn’t believe that  this was still her best friend and couldn’t believe that such a woman  had offered to share this gift with her. Amanda had declined, but had  stayed with Michelle for the rest of the day, goading into Michelle  trying to find new powers for an hour somewhere in the mountains outside  of town.</p>
<p>As long as she was with her best friend, Amanda felt fine, both  physically and mentally. It was after she returned home that her own  problems crept back into her mind which ended with her crying herself to  sleep. When she awoke in the morning, she was sick. Amanda had to force  herself to prepare Fred’s stuff so he wouldn’t stay too long when he  came for it and was slightly relieved that she didn’t need to keep  acting strong right now.</p>
<p>Amanda’s right hand was still hurting from the slap she had  given Fred. Yesterday she had seen something similar from Michelle, as  she threw a man around like it was nothing. Had it been this enhanced  Michelle that had slapped Fred, he would still feel it right now – and  Michelle’s hand wouldn’t hurt in the very least. Given her current  state, Amanda went back to her room in order to get some rest. This  would be the best way for her to recover from her cold, after all. How  ironic, yesterday she had planned for Michelle to become a real life  super heroine – with herself as the sidekick - while now she had to  worry about a simple cold. Amanda thought about the improvements that  had happened to Michelle’s normal body and wondered if her friend was  even able to catch a cold now. Well, even if she could, a single dose of  the super potion would most likely cure her as well.</p>
<p>Amanda was about to put on her PJs when it hit her. She had  some of the super potion in her possession. By drinking the potion, the  bleached blonde woman could practically shrug off the illness that would  otherwise ruin her whole day. And to top it off this stuff would most  likely turn her into a super powered goddess with unrivaled beauty and  power – except Michelle of course. She threw her pajama top away and  went – dressed only in her panties – to get one of the vials Michelle  had given her.</p>
<p>Michelle had said that these were in case something happened  that required her to transform. But how much of a help would Amanda be  in such a situation without any experience to be super at all? Taking  out one of the vials, the blonde stared at it intently. She had declined  to drink it yesterday because of her fear for negative long-term  effects, but right now Amanda didn’t care about that. She slowly  uncorked the vial and downed its greenish contend.</p>
<p>It took a few seconds before Amanda felt the first effects. Her  whole body was engulfed in a strange mix of dizziness and numbness. The  feeling grew, and Amanda feared she might lose her balance at any  moment, so she sat down on her bed. She was delighted as she felt  thenumbness grow weaker, but this was short-lived, since the dizziness  was  eplaced by another, much more uncomfortable feeling: pain. Amanda  could barely remember that Michelle had told her about that, as the pain  in her head increased so much, the young woman feared her head would  explode. Amanda’s only consolation was that she had a good picture as to  why she was having the headache of a lifetime right now. Her whole body  would be prepared for the use of super powers, so the first thing to  change would be the human brain that normally couldn’t handle them. She  clung to this thought while her vision got blurry before disappearing  altogether. For the moment, she was blind.</p>
<p>Her sight slowly returned at the same time the pain receded.  First she could only see a blurry image of her ceiling then she could  see clear again. It didn’t stop here, though as Amanda was suddenly able  to make out details she never could before. Amanda started to smile;  her eyesight had reached superhuman levels and her whole body would  follow suit. She stood back up and turned towards her full-length  mirror. She felt healthy, and there was no sign of her cold left.</p>
<p>Looking at her mirror image, she spotted the very first outside  change in her body immediately. The pitch black eyes she had been  rather proud of had been replaced by a fiery orange. Where Michelle’s  azure eyes were just the perfect variation of a normal eye color, Amanda  now sported eyes that showcased their supernatural origin.</p>
<p>Since she had seen Michelle transforming before, Amanda knew  the next thing to change would be her hair. She wondered whether it  would be a problem, that her normally brown hair had been bleached  blonde already. The moment she saw her hair fall out all at once  surprised her. Amanda was terrified for a second before she remembered  that Michelle’s hair had fallen out and regrown from scratch.</p>
<p>“She could’ve mentioned that I’ll never have any pubic hair  again,” she thought as she became aware of the fact that aside from her  head there was no hair root left on her body.</p>
<p>A tingling sensation on her scalp told Amanda that her hair was  about to grow. She wondered what color it would be, as her eyes had  already turned out different than Michelle’s. Soon she could see red  threads of hair coming out of her scalp, slowly but surely turning into a  fiery mane that went to the down of her back.</p>
<p>Simultaneously the young woman watched her face changing.  Amanda had been reasonably pretty before, but now her face became so  absolutely stunning she was positive she could turn a gay man straight  with a seductive smile. She chuckled as she remembered how close  Michelle had come to turning her into a lesbian without neither trying  nor realizing it.</p>
<p>Amanda was already looking forward to the next stage of her  transformation as it would affect everything besides her head. At least  that was what she thought since she had seen it during Michelle’s second  transformation. Michelle had never explained the difference between her  first and second transformation regarding this, but Amanda soon found  out that there were differences.</p>
<p>The young woman felt the strange surge of energy that had  preceded every stage of her transformation. She both saw and felt how  her legs began to lengthen, pushing her torso upwards which soon also  started to lengthen. Amanda was just as big as Michelle was, so she  correctly expected to end up with the same height her friend had after  her transformation. What bugged Amanda was that while growing a foot  from 5’3” to 6’3” just as expected, her body only seemed to lengthen,  whereas Michelle had also gained an athletic muscle tone and those  gigantic tits in the process.</p>
<p>As if on cue, Amanda felt another surge of energy going through  her and she even felt how it centered on all the muscles in her body.  Like a child on Christmas, she watched as she gained the same athletic  build Amanda had seen on Michelle before. The fat on her body melted  away while at the same time her muscles became more defined. One by one  her abs became visible becoming a sexy six pack. She could see the hints  of her biceps on her arm and at the same time felt her ass reshaping  itself. The process happened all over her body while the feeling of her  transformation was extremely arousing this time. Knowing that the  muscles on her body – while not bodybuilder-sized – could lift so much  more than humanly possible, helped Amanda to revel in these feelings  even more.</p>
<p>Once her muscles had finished growing, Amanda put on a  mischievous smile, as she knew what would happen next. The next energy  surge went straight into her breasts with a force and intensity that had  almost taken her over the edge.  Soon Amanda realized that her body  could now handle much more arousal, as her breasts started growing with  the most incredible and erotic feeling she had ever felt in her life.  She just stared at her breast expanding before her very eyes, not daring  to touch them as this incredible feeling went through them. In a few  but very intense seconds her breasts grew from B to DD, maybe even  further. Amanda was pretty sure her breasts had grown slightly bigger  than Michelle’s had, but she’d need to compare it to be sure.</p>
<p>Amanda looked at her body and wondered why she didn’t feel the  super energy Michelle had described, as another surge – no, a slow wave  would be the better term – went through her body. This wave – Amanda was  certain – was the super energy Michelle had spoken about, and her whole  body was infused by it right now. She was sure that the previous surges  had been the very same energy but instead of infusing her with powers,  the energy had been used for the transformation itself. This must be the  reason, why Michelle had all these previous steps at once as her body  could already handle the super energy. The buildup of energy inside her  felt extremely good yet but not in a sexual way. It was more like a  feeling of security and confidence as if she instinctively knew about  her ascension. Ironically she didn’t notice how her ascension became  literal as she subconsciously lifted herself on her toes before defying  gravity altogether.</p>
<p>The fact that her body was hovering several inches above the  floor didn’t escape the newly transformed superwoman for long. Upon  seeing her bare feet dangling above the floor, Amanda understood how  different Michelle and she had conceived things yesterday. The  now-redheaded woman had been irritated about how Michelle used pretty  much every opportunity to showcase her flight powers while Amanda had  felt really uncomfortable when Michelle shared that power with her. But  now Amanda didn’t feel this uncomfortable; in fact she felt better than  ever, and she knew that her own weightlessness was part of the reason  why she did feel so good.</p>
<p>Curiously, Amanda tried to control her flight. Just as Michelle  had described, she instinctively knew how to fly around as she pleased.  Sure that she possessed the same powers as Michelle, Amanda started to  try out some of them. First she flexed her arms to see the muscles on  them exploding into definition. Then she tried her X-Ray vision and saw  how the walls around her became transparent. In this state she could  actually watch any point in the city as long as she concentrated enough.  During that she also got the hang of how much of her super energy was  used on each power.</p>
<p>Then she tried out the power, Michelle had tested out the last  time she had seen her: creating a costume. Similar to her friend, she  started with a leotard, but hers was blue instead of black. Amanda saw  how the costume grew out of her skin and took the shape and color she  had imagined. The interesting part was that her panties were visible  under her leotard. Her self-made costume had grown around the only  article of clothes she ad been wearing. Amanda instinctively opened up  the bottom part of the leotard to put take her panties before casually  repairing the leotard to its original state. All of this felt so easy  that Amanda wondered how finding out new powers could be an issue at  all.</p>
<p>She even added the diamond-shaped S to her costume, but  eventually reversed it to a plain blue leotard. Amanda had wanted to  complete the Supergirl outfit but had to admit that the whole costume  creation power used up far too much power to be wasted for a game like  this. Creating a cape, skirt and boots with this power would most likely  use up everything she still had and Amanda was sure that her supply  could be used in a better way than this.</p>
<p>Eager to try out more, Amanda opened the door to her balcony  and hovered outside. It was still broad daylight, but the freshly  transformed woman couldn’t care less about being seen as long as nobody  saw her leaving her apartment. Yesterday, Michelle had demonstrated her  powers in front of several witnesses, so hiding the very existence of  super powers was no option any more. Rising high above the skyline in  less than a second, Amanda decided what to do next.</p>
<p>Michelle was confused about her encounter with James. One  moment of carelessness during her first transformation and this guy had  been able to track her down. If it weren’t for the absurdity of the  situation, he would have easily seen through her bluff. Yes, telling  someone that by drinking a certain liquid one would transform into a  super powered goddess was hard to believe even if the person knew  something was off – Amanda had proved this yesterday as she had  discovered the enhancement on Michelle’s normal self while not believing  her about the potion. The problem was that she had already shown her  powers in public. Sooner or later word of a flying woman with incredible  strength would reach him –maybe it already had - and once he accepted  the reality of these powers, the idea of her transforming from plain  Michelle to super powered goddess would sound plausible enough.</p>
<p>So with all the danger he could pose to her, why the hell had  she agreed to go on a date with him? It was true that she had been  interested in him from the moment she saw him, but she had also become  aware that he was onto her.  Why had she enjoyed his company so much  that she had started flirting with him? Speaking of which, James himself  had behaved strangely too. Her normal self may have been enhanced but  not enough for a guy with his looks to check her out so blatantly.  Michelle had actually dominated the whole conversation – despite the  fact that she was such a crappy liar.</p>
<p>Actually, the idea of them dating also had its advantages. Not  only was James a scientist, he also had connections to the police.  Through him, she might get some insider information if she needed to. He  may actually give her some insight about what this strange plant was  and how it worked. Too bad she couldn’t tell him about either as she  didn’t trust him enough – yet.</p>
<p>“Who the hell are you?” Fred asked the mysterious newcomer. He  had just arrived at his place and was about to get the stuff he had  brought from Amanda’s place out of his trunk when he spotted a drop dead  gorgeous redhead standing on his car.</p>
<p>“My name? That’s a secret!” was the answer.</p>
<p><img src="/obrazky/prispevky/michelles-meteor-memento/michelle_s_meteor_memento_04_01.jpg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>The woman wore nothing but a blue leotard that hugged her  impressive curves. Still, Fred had an uneasy feeling about this. Not  only was that redhead unnaturally beautiful, but she also looked down to  him with flaming eyes. Fred had never heard about orange being a normal  eye color, but he was sure this woman wasn’t wearing contacts.</p>
<p>“H-how did you get up there?”</p>
<p>“Oh I just flew around town and when I saw your car, I decided to mess a little with you.”</p>
<p>“You think you’re funny, huh? Now get off there, please!”</p>
<p>“I actually like it up here.” The woman now sat down on the car’s ceiling and rested her bare feet on the front window.</p>
<p>“I said get off!” Fred was now visibly annoyed.</p>
<p>“Oho, are you one of those guys who care more for their car than for a woman? In that case I know exactly what to do.”</p>
<p>The redhead lifted her right foot up for a bit, before she  kicked it into the front window. Fred watched in horror as the window  succumbed to her kick and shattered. The woman stood up, one foot on the  now exposed driving seat, the other on the dashboard – both of them  with shards of glass under them.  She then stepped forward onto the  hood.  A screeching sound made it clear that there were still glass  shards under her soles that now scratched off the paint. The woman  finally jumped off the car.</p>
<p>“Why the hell did you do that, you bitch?” Fred asked furiously  – too shocked by the damage done to his car, to even realize that her  bare feet should be bleeding now.</p>
<p>“What? I’m not standing on your car anymore, right?” The  redhead mocked, before taking a more serious expression. “And who are  you calling a bitch?”</p>
<p>It finally dawned on Fred that he was not in the position to  insult – let alone threaten – this woman. This wasn’t because of her  threatening tone, but because of her hovering in front of him. The  redhead was already big to begin with, but she became all the more  intimidating by levitating a few inches above the ground. As she came  closer towards him, his survival instinct kicked in and Fred turned  around to run away from this strange woman.</p>
<p><img src="/obrazky/prispevky/michelles-meteor-memento/michelle_s_meteor_memento_04_02.jpg#center" alt=""></p>
<p>His flight was short-lived as he felt her grab him and lift him  up from behind –his weight held by his shirt. The redhead was carrying  him higher and higher until… <em>riiip</em> … his shirt couldn’t carry his  weight any longer and he fell at least ten feet to the ground.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>He tried to land on his feet, but his left leg collapsed  underneath him. Fred rolled on the floor for a few feet before stopping.  His whole body hurt and he cursed the fact that he hadn’t worn anything  under his shirt meaning that his upper body had rubbed unprotected over  the asphalt. His upper body was covered in small cuts and bruises from  the asphalt, but the most painful part of his body was his left leg. His  knee to be exact. Fred grabbed his knee and tried to bring his leg into  a position that wouldn’t hurt so much, but he was sure that he wouldn’t  be able to stand up. Then he remembered that he wasn’t alone and stared  at the redhead with fear.</p>
<p>The woman showed an expression he hadn’t seen on her until now.  Gone was the mocking supremacy the woman had shown while trashing his  car. Gone was the threatening glare she had shown just before he tried  to flee. Gone was any sign of confidence.</p>
<p>The redhead stared at him in utter horror. Her eyes where fixed  on his hurting knee as if she knew exactly what was going on. She  wasn’t flying anymore. Instead she took somehow unsteady steps towards  him.</p>
<p>“This wasn’t supposed to… I didn’t mean to…” she stammered.</p>
<p>The woman reached for his knee, but Fred slapped her hands away.</p>
<p>“Get your hands of me you freak!”</p>
<p>Fred glared at her with furious hatred only to see tears forming in the strange redheads’ eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” was all she said as she retreated shortly. “But I can help.”</p>
<p>“After everything you’ve done … I don’t care for your sympathy&hellip; Now get lost!”</p>
<p>The pain overwhelmed Fred and he lost consciousness after  saying these words. He had no idea that the redhead had said these exact  words to him not too long ago. Unconscious as he was, he didn’t know  that the redhead took his cellphone and made some calls, one for the  ambulance to take care of him and one for her best friend to take care  of her.</p>
