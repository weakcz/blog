            <p>&ldquo;Dr. Thompson, do you have a minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>James turned around to face the woman who had addressed him. He already recognized her voice.</p>
<p>During the brainstorming earlier, she had interrupted several times to ask questions about the recent events - or at least the &ldquo;official version&rdquo; of those.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Dr&hellip;&rdquo; James took a look at her name tag. &ldquo;Archer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman gulped, then blushed as if she just now noticed that they were alone in his lab. &ldquo;Y-you may call me Deziree.&rdquo; She averted her eyes, this shy gesture pretty much underlined her already mousy appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what can I do for you, Deziree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; I uhm&hellip; still have a few questions about the whole story. You see, I wasn&rsquo;t informed about these individuals until this morning, when I saw them on the news. Not really giving me time to form my own theories before the meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, communication isn&rsquo;t really our strong suit here,&rdquo; James admitted. Normally he was just as angry about this fact, but today he had turned the tide by being significantly better informed than others.</p>
<p>Harland&rsquo;s arrogance had made him miss the information about the mutation not being sexually transferable. Granted, this particular bit of information had been important to James, whose girlfriend just so happened to be the very &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; that was the big news right now. A bit of information that he didn&rsquo;t intend to share with any of his colleagues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far we have four cases of this mutation: Jane Doe, the Angel, the Redhead and the Asian,&rdquo; Deziree began. &ldquo;The latter three have either shown or implied supernatural powers. Especially the ability to fly and enhanced strength. Jane Doe on the other hand died from her drug abuse. Could it be that this drug addiction somehow dampened the beneficial effects this mutation had on the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An interesting point of view, but James knew that this theory was wrong. From what he had heard, Amanda, &ldquo;the Redhead&rdquo;, took the super potion because she had felt sick and the effects had been just as dramatic as they  had been for Michelle. &ldquo;So far, the mutation seems to have canceled out the drug history - including her resistance to the respective drug. My theory right now is that whatever causes these powers is only temporary. According to her diary, Jane Doe had these kinds of abilities for a short time, but thought it was a vivid dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deziree listened intently. The whole topic obviously fascinated her. &ldquo;A temporary effect? But the Angel has been seen several times now, hasn&rsquo;t she? Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that she has access to whatever caused it and can repeat the process? In that case she could give whoever she wanted superpowers! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In theory yes. But as long as we don&rsquo;t have a clue about how this works, we shouldn&rsquo;t jump to conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right, it would be the same mistake Prof. Harland made. Although his proposal sounded a bit over the top to begin with. If you ask me even he wasn&rsquo;t that concerned about these powers being infective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This didn&rsquo;t surprise James half as much as it was supposed to. &ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deziree looked around carefully, as if to make sure they were indeed alone. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s about his daughter. He&rsquo;s been dumping her off in my lab and from what I understand she had an affair with one of the men that got hurt by these superwomen. I think it was the one who got crippled by the redhead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;which explains why he was crippled in the first place. James thought. He would&rsquo;ve liked to say it, but that would&rsquo;ve made the fact that the redhead was indeed Fred Riley’s actual girlfriend all the more obvious. In fact Amanda Steward could consider herself lucky that they had pretended to be in a healthy relationship right now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; he commented instead. &ldquo;So he just wanted to avenge his daughters honor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, daddy&rsquo;s little girl needs to be saved.&rdquo; Deziree suddenly burst out laughing. &ldquo;Sorry, but she&rsquo;s exactly the kind of person I can&rsquo;t stand. It was a huge pain to have her around, and in the last days I barely got anything done because of her. Good thing she hit the town today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of which, what&rsquo;s your area of expertise?&rdquo; James wanted to slap himself for not asking this earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh me? I&rsquo;m a botanist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Botanist?&rdquo; James repeated. &ldquo;So have there been any changes to our local flora that I should know about?&rdquo; He secretly hoped that she would deny it, of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm, perhaps?&rdquo; Deziree looked at him seductively. &ldquo;Maybe we could discuss that over dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear my girlfriend wouldn&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo; James answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I … uhm … sorry that came out wrong.&rdquo; Deziree&rsquo;s face turned crimson as she looked around searching for something to distract them from this awkward situation before suddenly turning around and storming out of the lab.</p>
<p>James sighed as the door closed behind her. Partially because of her flirting, partially because she didn&rsquo;t give him a clear answer. After all, he knew that Michelle and Amanda had gained their powers through a mysterious plant. If something like that had been found with the meteor, Deziree would be one of the first to know it.</p>
<p>Amanda stared at the gun for several seconds before she focused her vision on the person that was holding it. She recognized this man, but couldn&rsquo;t remember from where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step away from the body!&rdquo; The man ordered. His voice was calm, yet direct. Still, the word hurt Amanda on a different level. It reminded her that Erika, a woman who had lived her life to the fullest, now laid lifeless at her feet.</p>
<p>Amanda did as she was told. With shaky steps she moved away from Erika&rsquo;s motionless body. She felt awful. The man stepped forward and slowly bent down to feel Erika&rsquo;s pulse - all while still pointing the gun at Amanda. Did he believe that she had something to do with Erika&rsquo;s demise?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s cold&hellip;&rdquo; he began &ldquo;… which means that she&rsquo;s been dead for a while..&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda’s stomach grumbled and she immediately made her way to the bathroom, not caring about the man with the gun while she threw up in the toilet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Detective Jacob Spencer,&rdquo; he began once she returned from the bathroom - holding up his badge as proof – thankfully he didn’t point the gun at her anymore. &ldquo;And you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amanda Steward. And - uhm - sorry about that little outburst.&rdquo; She sat down in a nearby chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problem, finding a dead body is a pretty shocking experience.&rdquo; Det. Spencer then sheathed his gun, took out his phone and called reinforcements in while Amanda tried to process the situation.</p>
<p>Last night she had been attacked by a strange woman, a woman with powers similar to her own but with no apparent motive for doing so. Now the answer laid dead before Amanda. Erika had somehow transformed into a superwoman similar to Michelle and herself, and obviously intended to take revenge on the redhead that, a few days earlier, had assaulted her brother. Of course Erika didn&rsquo;t know that Amanda had been this redhead - not until last night when Amanda had run out of power and transformed back, right in front of her. Thinking back, it made sense that her attacker suddenly acted a lot more friendly with this revelation. Erika had obviously called her here with the intention of clearing things up. But now she was dead, which left Amanda with the question why this had happened or what had caused this?</p>
<p>&ldquo;… alright Thompson, get here as soon as you can,&rdquo; Jacob finished his second call before turning to the still brooding Amanda. &ldquo;And now to you. How exactly are you connected to Ms. Riley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m her brother&rsquo;s girlfriend.&rdquo; A tear ran down Amanda&rsquo;s cheek as she said that. &ldquo;Oh my, how am I going to tell him that his sister died.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t see how Jacob raised his brow at this. &ldquo;The police will take care of this if you want. And I need you to stay here for now.&rdquo; He took out a pair of disposable gloves that he put on as he began to investigate the place. Starting with Erika, he soon noticed the ruined outfit scattered on the floor. &ldquo;This looks just like the clothes she&rsquo;s wearing,&rdquo; he commented as he found a single intact boot and placed it right next to its equal counterpart that still sat on Erika&rsquo;s foot. &ldquo;Just bigger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; Amanda tried to sound just as surprised as the detective. She had already solved this riddle: Erika had used her new powers to recreate the clothes that had gotten destroyed during her fight with Amanda. When she had transformed back to normal, these clothes had shrunk along with her body. No wonder the normal boot that had survived the battle was bigger than its shrunken counterpart. The interesting part was that the clothes hadn&rsquo;t disappeared when she had transformed back. Amanda had experienced something similar, but she had at least more experience with this. Then again Amanda had not been able to create real shoes - whereas Erika&rsquo;s first attempt had been a prefect replica of the boot that she had lost during their struggle. Well, she was always good when it came to fashion, maybe that took over to her super form?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah there you are&hellip;&rdquo; Jacob suddenly exclaimed. &ldquo;seems like she leaves you her wardrobe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Amanda took a second to get out of her own thoughts. &ldquo;Wait a second, is that … her will? Why the hell had she a will prepared?&rdquo; Had her involvement in the bank robbery shaken her up this much?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she lived her life to its fullest and expected to die every day – that’s how she called it. Even though she doesn&rsquo;t own that much, her will is very thought out. See for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon looking at Erika&rsquo;s will, Amanda could only agree with him. This wasn&rsquo;t some hastily put together will. It included details about where and how to bury her, whom she wanted to invite at the funeral - and whom not.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for the reinforcements to arrive. Amanda had expected them to take the place apart, searching for evidence at every corner. But the truth was that there was nothing indicating that Erika was the victim of a crime, even though Detective Spencer was clearly suspicious about the whole situation. Eventually the will was taken away from Amanda - after all it was an important document about how to proceed now. But Amanda had already read all the important parts.</p>
<p>Then came the questions, but nothing dramatic. Who was she? What relation had she to the deceased? Why had she come here? All questions Amanda could answer truthfully without having to fear this information might hint at her other self. It all went by as if it was a haze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ms. Steward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda looked, once again, up to see a familiar face. It was James Thompson, the cute scientist her best friend Michelle was currently dating. As far as Amanda knew he was still unaware of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Thompson,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My deepest condolence. I&rsquo;m sure this came unexpected for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda simply nodded as she woke from her trance and, for what felt like the hundredth time, wiped away her tears. Normally by now her face would have been red because of all this crying, but this wasn&rsquo;t the case. Not that Amanda had the time nor the will to appreciate this little benefit of her superpowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem.&rdquo; Detective Spencer interrupted. &ldquo;Dr. Thompson, if you have a minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>James went over to Erika&rsquo;s corpse to examine what Det. Spencer wanted to show him. Now that Amanda actually paid attention, she could even hear their whispering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days ago she had a scar just there, but now it&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you notice a scar there?&rdquo; James asked back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say I met her at a bar and leave it at that. What&rsquo;s important is who else was at the bar.&rdquo; Jacob turned around to check if Amanda could listen to them, and obviously believed that she couldn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;It may be farfetched, but I think the Asian was there as well as a man who could be … well super. I didn&rsquo;t see them, but Eri&hellip; Ms. Riley did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has this to do with the scar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well maybe she found him last night? If this guy was super, maybe he somehow made the Asian super and maybe her as well. I mean she does look a bit better than before, right? And verify her cause of death, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most likely cause is a heart attack, considering her condition. But only the autopsy will verify this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing hinting at a crime - unless you count Ms. Steward finding her at an unfortunate time as evidence. So you&rsquo;ll have to get an approval for an autopsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rdquo; Then he looked back at Amanda. &ldquo;Do you still need her here? If she isn&rsquo;t a suspect she&rsquo;s free to go right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, just thought that you might want to question her too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James straightened himself back up and approached Amanda again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re done here for now. Do you want me to drive you home - or somewhere else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda thought for a second. A part of her really wanted to go home and lie in her bed until this nightmare was over. But she knew that this would just be running away - and Fred would need her at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hospital,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Five minutes later they were sitting in James car, driving through the streets. Amanda wondered how to proceed. Knowing that Erika had been super was a shock, but it was disturbing that the detective had picked up on the little hints on that rather quickly. Then again Amanda shouldn&rsquo;t be the one to complain. After all, this very sharpness had prevented him from jumping to the wrong conclusion that Amanda had something to do with Erika&rsquo;s death. Not to mention that he had accepted this rather unconventional death easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo; she started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you react if you learned that the person you love kept a really big secret from you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>James looked at her quizzically and Amanda realized that she might&rsquo;ve asked the wrong person. After all, two days ago he had been on a date with the very woman who was now the big news because of her preventing a plane crash. After a few seconds James finally answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would depend on what kind of secret we&rsquo;re talking about. There&rsquo;s always a reason why such a secret is kept and I would need to hear that before deciding whether or not I agree. My girlfriend, for example, can be a bit too trustful at times and I already know private things about her that she might have kept hidden from me for a few more months without me having any reason to feel betrayed  by them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shiver went down her spine as she heard that. What exactly did this guy know?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt these things are on the same level as what I am talking about.&rdquo; At least she hoped as much.</p>
<p>James shrugged. &ldquo;Maybe, maybe not. You would need to go into more detail because I sure as hell won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the part about trusting one another. She shared these bits with me because she knew I wouldn&rsquo;t tell anybody. And I don&rsquo;t intend to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough. I hope for her sake it stays that way.&rdquo; Amanda sighted. &ldquo;As for me, I&rsquo;ll have to wait and see what he has to say in his defense. Oh and could you do me a favor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you deliver the bad news to him? I need some time for myself before I go to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the drive continued in silence. Amanda&rsquo;s day had been too rough to currently care what exactly Michelle had told James - if she even was the girlfriend in question. She had been feeling awful enough all day, even without all the worse after Erika&rsquo;s sudden passing.</p>
<p>When Amanda finally made her way into Fred&rsquo;s hospital room, James had already been gone for over half an hour. She had needed the time to think about their current situation and to ascertain a few things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Fred greeted her weakly. He tried to smile, but the sadness was too obvious for it to be convincing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to play tough,&rdquo; Amanda assured him. &ldquo;It would be much more disturbing if you were unaffected by the loss of your last living relative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred closed his eyes. &ldquo;How did you know&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;that the two of you were adopted? It was mentioned in Erika&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; He averted his eyes before actually opening them to stare out of the window. Amanda then took his hand.</p>
<p>Fred turned back to her, holding her gaze as she held his hand. Now he realized that she was on the verge of crying herself. He pulled her over to himself, embracing her as she began to cry into his chest. It took her a few minutes until she calmed herself down again.</p>
<p>Still leaning onto him, Amanda eventually said &ldquo;Would you care to explain to me why she had a heart attack at her age? How come she even had a will? Did she expect to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a smart girl. I&rsquo;m sure you already figured it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up to face him. &ldquo;It would mean a lot to me to hear it from you&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason to hide it anymore.&rdquo; He took a deep breath, making it painfully obvious that he still struggled with what he was about to say. &ldquo;Erika and I suffer from a genetic condition that&rsquo;s commonly known as &lsquo;Harland Syndrome&rsquo;. This -uhm-&rdquo; Fred gasped for air as the force of Amanda&rsquo;s hug had increased as she heard that. &ldquo;&hellip;causes a creeping degeneration in the human heart, eventually leading to a fatal heart attack. Usually this happens in the late twenties&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;… meaning there&rsquo;s little chance you live until thirty.&rdquo; Amanda finished the sentence. Tears were still flowing from her eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Erika lived the life she did. Why she went home with a different man at every opportunity. She knew she couldn&rsquo;t expect a long life, so she lived it to the fullest. I wouldn&rsquo;t even be surprised if she had volunteered to be the hostage back then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She probably did.&rdquo; Fred continued. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no cure, at least none that&rsquo;s guaranteed to work. So she didn&rsquo;t waste her time and hopes on that, but rather enjoyed her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about you? Why don&rsquo;t you live a similar life?&rdquo; Amanda asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it has something to do with our parents. They both had the Syndrome as well and died when we were still young. I have no actual recollection of them but, since Erika was older, she witnessed our parents dying. I think she felt left alone because of that and never had a serious relationship because of that. She said it would be better if there was nobody to mourn her when she died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here we are doing just that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, and I think it&rsquo;s better this way. If nobody mourned her, she might as well never have existed. It&rsquo;s sad to think that she would leave this world with no legacy whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see why you would try to live a normal life, but why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about your condition?&rdquo; Amanda already could imagine the answer, but she wanted to hear it anyway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To put it simply: each time when a girlfriend of mine learned about my condition, this more or less meant the end of our relationship. Either she would break up because she couldn&rsquo;t deal with the situation or I would do so because of the same reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shivered as he said that and Amanda didn&rsquo;t need an explanation why. Fred was obviously scared that this would repeat itself now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare break up with me now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all that happened, I&rsquo;m not really in the position to do that, am I?&rdquo; Now it was Fred who hugged her tighter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just glad you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of which, how exactly did your cheating on me fit into this? Did you try to get into one of Harland&rsquo;s test groups?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty much. You even know about those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harland was pretty much the reason I failed med school. The whole exam was nothing but the tiniest details of the Harland Syndrome while I had prepared myself to answer questions that were aimed at more than just one genetic sickness. Did I mention I hate his guts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems to be the general consensus. Erika couldn&rsquo;t stand him as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you banged his daughter&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred sighted. &ldquo;Are you reading my mind or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No silly, I&rsquo;m just good at putting two and two together.&rdquo; Amanda giggled, but quickly stopped it as she remembered the circumstances. &ldquo;Erika&rsquo;s will had a bit more information than just the fact that you are adopted after all. For example she specifically mentioned that Prof. Christopher Harland is not allowed to perform an autopsy on her no matter what. As far as I know he&rsquo;s only interested in doing that to Harland Syndrome patients - hence the name. Speaking of which, you didn&rsquo;t want to give the name of your affair and only mentioned she had connections. Which fits perfectly for his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sherlock Holmes got nothing on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tough luck for you, that I know a bit more about Harland than the average girl. That doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that you cheated on me. And just to be clear, I won&rsquo;t tolerate that a second time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I intended to do that. I seriously doubt that I could sneak into one of the test groups this way. And considering the success ratio, I think I should get used to the idea that m&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda had put her hand on his mouth, effectively silencing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;… that your time is running out? Don&rsquo;t give me that!&rdquo; Amanda stared into his eyes. &ldquo;If there was one good thing about this whole ordeal, then it was your will to live. The chances were slim, yet you grasped for every straw you could get. Sure you failed, but the reason for that should be obvious: You failed because you were alone.&rdquo; She then framed his face with her hands, still staring into his eyes. &ldquo;But now I&rsquo;m with you on this. I won&rsquo;t allow you to die so easily. I will find a solution for you to live a long life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to do that,&rdquo; Fred weakly protested. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to stick with me just out of guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing this out of guilt!&rdquo; Amanda&rsquo;s retort was surprisingly calm. &ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;m still feeling guilty about your knee, which I intend to fix if possible, but in the bigger picture that doesn&rsquo;t mean much. I want to be with you for as long as possible, it&rsquo;s as simple as that. Or do you have any objections?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one condition.&rdquo; Fred held Amanda&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;Marry me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda&rsquo;s eyes grew wide as she heard that. Her irises even turned into the fiery orange that was normally part of her super form. She wasn&rsquo;t aware of this, of course, but she couldn&rsquo;t care less anyway. Even the fact that Fred had popped the question without having a ring to present her didn&rsquo;t bother her in the least. Before she knew it, Amanda had thrown her arms around him and kissed him passionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like she&rsquo;s going to show up,&rdquo; Debbie whispered at the scene. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both she and Michelle were standing in the third row of onlookers in front of a traffic accident. Actually they were only watching the aftermath, but it was enough to dishearten Michelle. They were standing there, watching while the firefighters brought in the necessary tools to free the man that was trapped in the remains of his car. For her super form it would have been an easy feat, but right now she couldn&rsquo;t help the situation at all. Debbie&rsquo;s words only helped to make that clear. Michelle&rsquo;s old and new colleague had only gotten here in the slight hope that the biggest news in town would show up to save the day. Michelle turned to leave as she heard a young girls voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mommy why doesn&rsquo;t the Angel come to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only a child could ask such a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She probably has something more important to do. There are a lot of people out there that need help and she can&rsquo;t help everyone, you know? There is only one person to save now and fire workers have this one covered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a surprisingly well thought-out answer. Michelle turned to look at the woman who had just said that. She seemed familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when she came to save me, I was the only one to save as well,&rdquo; the young girl retorted. &ldquo;And there were fire workers too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Michelle remembered where she had seen the woman. Saturday night, after practicing her abilities in the woods, she had returned to find a burning house and immediately jumped into the fire to save whoever was in there. This had been the first time she had used her powers to save someone - a young girl that just so happened to share her first name. A young girl that just had blurted out the fact that she was saved within Debbie&rsquo;s earshot&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My my,&rdquo; Debbie began, as she approached the little Michelle. &ldquo;So you have seen the Angel on TV?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl shook her head. &ldquo;No, she came to save me when our house burned down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my god, does that mean all your stuff was burned down as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unexpectedly the young girl nodded and her expression darkened a bit. It seemed like she had forgotten the losses already and was now reminded of them. &ldquo;Yeah, but Dad says we&rsquo;re going to buy new ones from our insu&hellip; insu&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insurance,&rdquo; Debbie finished the sentence. &ldquo;They usually take some time until they help you. How long has it been since the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two … three&hellip; no,&rdquo; the girl tried to do the math. Eventually she looked at her mother’s direction for help. &ldquo;uhm how many days ago was Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four days. So you have seen the Angel?&rdquo; Debbie answered the question herself.</p>
<p>The young girl nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip; just like on TV actually, but more beautiful. Mom says her eyes were glowing, right mom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Debbie&rsquo;s attention shifted to the mother who had been watching the situation carefully. No surprise there, what mother would look away while her daughter talked to a stranger? She nodded carefully, clearly not wanting to bring more attention to herself or her daughter. Michelle was glad that she was successful. The crowd obviously didn&rsquo;t believe that the young girl had indeed encountered her. Debbie on the other hand&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to talk about that a bit more over coffee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours later Michelle finally returned to her apartment, and let out a sigh of relief. In the end the woman didn&rsquo;t have too much to say. Of course Michelle was fine with that, while Debbie would&rsquo;ve preferred juicy details. In fact it felt good to see her namesake being well and healthy.</p>
<p>She had barely stepped through the door when she heard the doorbell. A quick glance through the spyhole revealed it to be Amanda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Michelle greeted her friend and immediately found herself being hugged, showing her that Amanda had something on her mind. Not even when she had showed up last Saturday - after her breakup with Fred - had she seemed this shaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Michelle asked once she returned with some coffee from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do I start? Do you want the good news, the bad news or should I switch between them chronologically?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is fine with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took Amanda another thirty minutes to explain every detail about what had happened to her and Fred in the last few days. Starting from them getting back together about him telling her that he knew about her secret identity. About the mysterious attacker who happened to be Erika, Fred&rsquo;s sister, who mere hours later died due to a genetic sickness Amanda hadn&rsquo;t known about. She also explained that Fred&rsquo;s whole cheating had been mostly to find a way to get cured of the very same sickness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;… and I said yes,&rdquo; Amanda finished her explanation. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s all about finding a cure so that &lsquo;until death do us part&rsquo; will be a bit more than a five-year-plan.&rdquo; She tried her best to smile, but the matter was too serious for her to laugh it away with a lame joke.</p>
<p>Michelle on the other hand was rather shocked to hear that the woman she had saved from a hostage situation had simply died only a few days later. Fortunately she remembered the encounter with her namesake, otherwise she might&rsquo;ve gotten the idea that her actions had been for naught. And right now Amanda needed her support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I don&rsquo;t understand: If Erika had been super, her genes should have been changed dramatically. James said that there were over fifty chromosomes added to our DNA through that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda waved her hand dismissively. &ldquo;Adding new chromosomes doesn&rsquo;t mean the old ones get changed. The Harland syndrome wasn&rsquo;t cured by gaining super powers. It looks like it was the other way around. Becoming normal again made her weak enough to suffer the fatal heart attack that otherwise could&rsquo;ve taken a few more months or even years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that for sure. From what I can tell I don&rsquo;t really feel weaker or more vulnerable when I transform back.&rdquo; Michelle retorted. &ldquo;But James is investigating this anyway, he took a blood sample from me this morning and will try to find out whether our immune system is affected negatively. But it seems like he&rsquo;s rather occupied with other things too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda stared at her dumbfounded. &ldquo;D-did you tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhm, yeah.&rdquo; Michelle averted her gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s cool with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, he may have his concerns, but in general he likes it. I even gave him one hell of a show by transforming in front of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me guess: The Angel proved to be rather naughty back then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Super naughty,&rdquo; Michelle giggled remembering how she had pretty much assaulted James right afterwards. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t believe how great it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think I do. There&rsquo;s a reason Fred calls me Devil, after all. I&rsquo;m good at being naughty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both women started to giggle in unison, almost forgetting about the serious topic that they had been talking about earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I wanted to ask you a favor,&rdquo; Amanda eventually continued. &ldquo;As Devil, my mental capacities are greatly enhanced, and since I want to find a cure for Fred&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;… you want a bit more of the potion.&rdquo; Michelle concluded. &ldquo;Of course, take as much as you need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Michelle. You really are an Angel.&rdquo; Amanda let out a sigh of relief. &ldquo;But speaking of which, how did it feel to carry a plane? I&rsquo;ve seen the video footage and you seemed pretty exhausted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, I actually overused my flight powers back there, but it had some nifty side-effects.&rdquo; Michelle concentrated hard and rose into the air.</p>
<p>Amanda&rsquo;s eyes widened. She hadn&rsquo;t expected to see her friend flying in her normal form, even though Michelle&rsquo;s flight was rather short-lived and she landed back onto the cushions after a few seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the hell are you doing that without super energy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Technically we can turn every kind of energy into super energy. It&rsquo;s just a matter of efficiency. When I carried the plane yesterday, I really went all out, but subsequently became more efficient when it comes to flying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, if we exercise a certain power enough, we&rsquo;ll be able to use it even in our normal form?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a certain degree, yes. But it&rsquo;s really exhausting since we can&rsquo;t muster much energy in our normal form. Makes me wonder why we&rsquo;re capable of doing that at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, that doesn&rsquo;t make much sense.&rdquo; Amanda said and put her hand on her chin. A few seconds later she exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh my god, it&rsquo;s so simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember when you saved that girl from the burning building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I actually ran into her earlier, but go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During that you absorbed the excess heat from the fire and replenished a bit of your super energy, right? Just like you converted my heat vision into super energy as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words we&rsquo;re capable of absorbing excess energy and store it as super energy,&rdquo; Amanda concluded. &ldquo;In hindsight that&rsquo;s the same thing the plants does in order to create the super potion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m setting it on fire or something. All it gets is water and sunlight like every other plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. The plant absorbs sunlight in order to create super energy. Absorbing heat is basically the same thing - we&rsquo;re just not as good at it yet. And if we can do that in our normal form too&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;… we could eventually become as effective as the plant.&rdquo; Michelle finished, unsure whether or not this was a good thing. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean we&rsquo;d be permanently super?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it actually makes sense: This plant came from outer space, right? The only thing it could depend on was the light from the suns and other electromagnetic energy on its god-know-how-long-journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michelle stood up and walked towards the window. She believed that Amanda&rsquo;s theory was right, but she wanted some confirmation. So she held out her hand into the sunlight while the rest of her stayed in the shadow. At first, the only difference she felt was the usual warmth that was to be expected from the sunlight. But after a few seconds she felt the slightest hint of something else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can feel something, but I can&rsquo;t really describe it. If that&rsquo;s how absorbing sunlight feels like it&rsquo;ll probably take months until the amount is big enough to cause a transformation,&rdquo; Michelle exclaimed, hoping that she was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D-do you think that one day we&rsquo;ll transform into our super selves and not turn back?&rdquo; Amanda sounded concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. We will still be able to use up all our super energy so we should be able to transform back … but who knows how long we&rsquo;ll stay normal?&rdquo; Michelle imagined herself at work, suddenly transforming into her super self. She would probably end up on the wrong end of the camera before the process was over. &ldquo;It sure would be nice to choose when to transform,&rdquo; she said absentmindedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, earlier I ran into a traffic accident and had to watch while the firefighters cut open the car. I just thought to myself that it would&rsquo;ve been nice if I could just slip away from that scene, transform in private and then come to help in my super form. You know, like in a comic book. It&rsquo;s frustrating to watch things knowing that I could help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sound like you couldn&rsquo;t chose your transformation at all, while you only have to drink the potion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carrying it around with me at all time is a bit risky. What if I lost it, causing it to fall into the wrong hands? What if someone saw me drinking it? And that&rsquo;s only the turning super part. Getting back to normal is another issue since I have to use up all the super energy - meaning that most of it goes to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a point there. The ability to transform back and forth at will would be very useful to keep our identities secret. But then again maybe we can learn to do it? I mean if you can generate some super energy to use your powers, you can also contain at least some of it without transforming, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michelle thought about this for a second. Last night, when she had demonstrated her transformation to James for the first time, she had managed to gain a certain amount of control over the transformation. She wasn&rsquo;t able to stop it, but with enough exercise she might be able to. Then she remembered the words from her doppelganger: &lsquo;Unless you really want to&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right. Our powers are influenced by our minds, so if we really want it, we should be able to learn how to control the transformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda raised her eyebrow. &ldquo;That sounds like we could do everything we set our minds on - which I actually doubt. I tried to use healing powers - and trust me, I wanted them - but it didn&rsquo;t happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you just lacked the necessary knowledge? I mean we instinctively know how to use the super energy for certain things. But with other skills there are things that go beyond mere instinct and require a bit of research. Like with your heat vision for example. Remember how I wasn&rsquo;t able to use it Saturday night? When you transformed on Sunday you accidentally stumbled on this ability. And why? Because you know better about the idea of heat vision. And when you hit me with it, I intuitively learned how to use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&hellip;&rdquo; Amanda hesitated. &ldquo;… actually makes sense. When I fought with Erika yesterday, I wanted to provoke her to shoot me with her heat vision so I would get a power-up, but she didn&rsquo;t know how to do it. On the other hand, she was a lot more talented when it came to creating clothes. She knew more about fashion than any of us and her created clothes didn&rsquo;t even disappear when she died. And since she gave me some of her super energy&hellip;&rdquo; Amanda pulled up her shirt to reveal a black bra with red flames. &ldquo;… neither did mine when I transformed back to normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michelle stared at the bra her best friend was wearing. Her own clothes had always disappeared once she transformed back to normal or they separated from her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is actually a good way to save energy. Creating the costumes uses a lot of energy, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Way ahead of you! This way you could create your entire wardrobe and shift its shape to your costume when you transform. You wouldn&rsquo;t have to care about where to hide your clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make it sound like I could do that, but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I give you my super energy now, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be able to do it as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any super energy right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw come on,&rdquo; Amanda pouted. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll need to transform first. Then I can give you super energy and the ability along with it. Come to think of it, this will benefit you twice: I can just give you small amounts of super energy - after all I have a better way of measuring it than you drinking the stuff per drop. This way you can try to prevent a transformation with only a small amount of super energy to contain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really want to do this,&rdquo; Michelle sighted. &ldquo;I feel kinda bad taking your help when you have so much on your hands as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is just like you to say that,&rdquo; Amanda smiled. &ldquo;I see it like a welcome distraction from these problems. You see in a twisted kind of way a part of Erika literally continues to exist in form of this power-up she unknowingly gave me. It&rsquo;s her legacy and I&rsquo;m sure she would want you to have it as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no denying that. Amanda had given it more thought than Michelle would have expected. Michelle then nodded and went to get the bottle of super serum she had saved over the last days. When she returned, Amanda had already stripped down to her underwear, now wearing nothing but the flame-patterned bra and panties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, you really saved up a lot of this stuff,&rdquo; she commented as she saw the full bottle. &ldquo;I thought you would have used up a lot more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, Michelle&rsquo;s supply had increased over time. Despite her nightly patrols, she used less of the potion than the plant produced. So she had quickly filled this first bottle and had the next one full as well - each holding ten of their original doses worth of super serum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have the whole bottle if you want, I&rsquo;ve got more than enough.&rdquo; Michelle then handed the bottle over and Amanda poured herself a big glass of the serum. Michelle guessed it was about two doses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is for Erika,&rdquo; Amanda raised the glass in the air, before she drank its contents.</p>
<p>The transformation started immediately. Before Amanda could even put the glass down on the table, her hair had already grown down her back and turned from its not-so-original blonde into the fiery red that Michelle was still getting used to, while her eyes were glowing orange. Within a few more seconds she had grown about a foot in height, gained a decent muscle tone while her breasts grew into the D-cup range. And interestingly her bra grew along with her. Naturally Amanda rose into the air - Michelle knew from experience that this was an almost instinctive reaction to the pleasure of the transformation process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This never gets old,&rdquo; Amanda exclaimed, her voice now deeper and sexier. &ldquo;And now to you.&rdquo; She held out her hand towards Michelle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Michelle said as she began to undress herself as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep them on!&rdquo; Amanda interrupted.</p>
<p>Michelle gulped at the added risk. If she failed, her outfit would get torn apart by her growing body, just like her pajamas had done back when she transformed for the first time. She realized that her best friend wanted to motivate her this way.</p>
<p>Michelle took Amanda&rsquo;s hand and immediately sensed how her friend offered to share the super energy with her. Slowly, she accepted what Amanda had to offer and could feel the energy flow slowly from Amanda to her. Both women were clearly trying to limit this flow as much as possible without halting it altogether. And thanks to this, Michelle wasn&rsquo;t overwhelmed by the sheer amount, so that she actually managed to prevent her body from changing as the energy spread through her body.</p>
<p>Michelle quickly noticed that her cells reacted differently to the super energy that was flowing into her. While her &lsquo;normal&rsquo; cells simply absorbed the super energy to become more efficient, there were also the &lsquo;super&rsquo; cells - the cells which made up the extra mass of her super form - which were a lot smaller than normal cells right now. Michelle knew that these cells would grow once they were flooded with super energy and thus avoided doing so. This was easier said than done, as her instincts told her to do just that.</p>
<p>Closing her eyes, Michelle concentrated hard to divert the super energy onto each normal cell. By now every normal cell in her body contained some of the super energy - and the desire to also flood the &lsquo;super&rsquo; cells right next to them only got stronger and stronger. It didn&rsquo;t help that these super cells were spread all throughout her body instead of being concentrated in one area. Michelle then noticed that this desire varied considering which type of cell it was. While most of her &lsquo;super&rsquo; cells were muscle cells - not to mention that she had more &lsquo;super&rsquo; muscle cells than normal ones - it was easier not to flood them with super energy. This was probably due to them not going fully active even in her super form. Despite being fit and toned, her super form could increase its muscle mass to bodybuilder-like proportions when really necessary. Now this was one added benefit.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Michelle had thought the cells in her breasts were even easier to control, but this turned out to be untrue. While at first she didn&rsquo;t feel any desire to flood even her normal cells there, once she had reached a certain point it came with full force. Naturally Michelle assumed that she could slowly fill her normal cell and avoid the &lsquo;super&rsquo; cells in between. Unfortunately she had forgotten that just like with her muscles there were a lot more &lsquo;super&rsquo; cells in there as well. Her super breasts were a solid DD cup compared to her usual A cup, after all. And unlike her muscle cells there was no subconscious help to avoid flooding them here&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahh&rdquo; Michelle moaned as her concentration fell apart. One tiny moment of distraction and a few of her &lsquo;super&rsquo; cells were flooded with energy, causing them to transform. The feeling of this was so satisfying, that Michelle didn&rsquo;t even care anymore and without her resistance the rest of her body followed suit. Since the energy had already spread throughout her body, the transformation didn&rsquo;t even take a second to be over. Her body grew a foot in height while it became more muscular as well. In fact, for an instant, all her muscles were active, meaning that she was even bigger than her usual super form before shrinking back to just that. With this extreme and quick transformation, her wardrobe was literally blown off her, leaving her in nothing but her panties - that struggled to stay intact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Amanda concluded. &ldquo;So much for the first attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bar was still empty, but Susan couldn&rsquo;t care less. She needed a drink. No, she needed a lot of drinks if she wanted to compensate for how terrible she felt. First her so-called boyfriend turned out to be just another guy hired by her father to keep her occupied. And instead of consoling her - or even apologizing - he just dumped her in some botanic lab with this woman Deziree Archer. It was pretty obvious that the nerdish woman couldn&rsquo;t stand Susan, and this didn&rsquo;t lighten her mood in the slightest.</p>
<p>While Susan was good-looking and rich, she still had some struggle with men. They were either stupid jerks that broke up with her after a short while or turned out to be hired by her father to keep her company. Was she that hard to stand?</p>
<p>No! It was them who were at fault. One day, she would be in a position where they needed her help and she would be happy to let them suffer for abandoning her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does a young woman like you do at a bar this early,&rdquo; came a voice behind her.</p>
<p>Susan turned around to see one hell of a hunk. She instantly wondered if she had already drunk so much that she was fantasizing him. He clearly was too good-looking to be an actual person, but apparently he was as real as he could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cursing the world for my loneliness,&rdquo; she answered. Normally she wouldn&rsquo;t care about whether or not he liked the comment, but right now she was actually nervous about the answer. When he rewarded her with a smile, she couldn&rsquo;t help but return it as she gazed into his steel blue, almost glowing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it looks like you need to blow off some steam.&rdquo;</p>
