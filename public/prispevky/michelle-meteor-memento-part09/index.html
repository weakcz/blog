            <p>Fred stared at the open window of his hospital room as if he expected her. Amanda had silently watched his conversation with Erika, using her newfound super hearing to eavesdrop.</p>
<p>But Fred hadn&rsquo;t hinted that he expected her to come, nor pretended to care that Erika forgot to close the window as she had left the room. After all, he wasn&rsquo;t able to stand up and close it himself. Whatever the reason, Amanda took the opportunity to enter the room, once she was sure Erika was gone and Fred wouldn&rsquo;t suspect her of having eavesdropped. It was dark outside and the hospital room was also very poorly lighted, but he seemed to notice her right away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; she said, unsure of how to address her boyfriend. Right now she was her alter ego after all, a woman that should be a bit flirty with him, but not more. Especially considering the fact that she was the reason he was hospitalized in the first place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; came the answer. Fred didn&rsquo;t seem to be in the best of moods – this much was obvious even without her already knowing the issue at hand. &ldquo;Uhm, nice outfit.&rdquo; he added nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like it?&rdquo; Amanda teased, in fact she hadn&rsquo;t come here to show off the prototype for her costume, but to find out what he was hiding from her. But right now it would be better to play along and divert his attention away from her goal – he might become too suspicious if she cut to the chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah sure,&rdquo; Fred agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an expert when it comes to fashion, but this outfit is clearly intimidating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intimidating? I thought we were past this.&rdquo; Amanda pouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I say? It&rsquo;s dark and your eyes glow orange, it&rsquo;s really hard not to be scared shitless right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? I wasn&rsquo;t even aware that they glow.&rdquo; Amanda finally touched the ground and strolled towards the bed. &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhm, yeah, I&rsquo;m trying my best.&rdquo; Fred seemed really nervous now.</p>
<p>Amanda pondered the reasons. Sure, their first encounter in her super form had been bad for his health but, after her apology, she didn&rsquo;t expect to be this intimidating. Another possible reason could be the conversation he had had with Erika before. His sister had brought up the possibility that Amanda and Devil – that name was getting more appropriate by the second – were the same person. Fred had been a bit too convinced that this wasn&rsquo;t the case, so Amanda feared that he actually suspected her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, how&rsquo;s your knee doing?&rdquo; Amanda asked while she obviously used her X-Ray vision to check for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you can see, not much different,&rdquo; Fred exclaimed shortly.</p>
<p>Amanda nodded, even though she thought otherwise. With her improved senses she could see the progress the healing process had made in the last two days. Even back then she was able to pick up that the process stopped as soon as she had shared her invulnerability with him. Still Fred wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell the difference, so Amanda refrained from mentioning it. After all she might slip into medical terms that would only give him a further hint at her identity – after all he knew about her failed attempt to become a doctor. Damn, the sheer implication that he might suspect her was making her nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be in a good mood. Had some bad news?&rdquo; Amanda thought she might as well cut to the chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you had to lie in the hospital all day, you wouldn&rsquo;t be in a good mood by the evening as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have any visitors besides me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, but not every visitor is good news, you know. The police for example changes their opinion of me on a daily basis. First they simply suspect me of covering up what happened to me – which was true. Then, when they learned the truth – sorry about that – they act all serious but the last guy who was here really had the most outrageous questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was new to Amanda – why hadn&rsquo;t Fred mentioned this to her when she had been here earlier?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outrageous questions? What kind of questions were those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really wanna know? They asked me about whether or not it was possible for you to have sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding me, right?&rdquo; Amanda could feel her cheeks taking on the same color as her fiery hair.</p>
<p>Fred shook his head. &ldquo;I first thought it to be a joke as well, but this guy was serious. He said that it was about a case and this information could be the difference between accident and assault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda gulped, her embarrassment quickly changing into concern. She knew that she hadn&rsquo;t done anything that could be interpreted as a sex-accident. The only other person capable of something like that was Michelle and her date looked alive and well this morning. Not to mention that Michelle was pretty much the last person on Earth to do something like that. No, this could only mean&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more like me out there&hellip;&rdquo; she exclaimed, secretly proud that she hadn&rsquo;t said &ldquo;us&rdquo; in this situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know? There seems to be at least one out there that beat you to the whole superhero idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! I bet she doesn&rsquo;t have a kickass costume like me!&rdquo; Amanda said, knowing fully well that Michelle wasn&rsquo;t that interested in finding a good costume in the first place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least she was there when my sister was in trouble,&rdquo; Fred snarked. &ldquo;You wasted one hell of an opportunity to make up for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That comment felt like a slap to her face. Amanda had been so good at pretending to know nothing, she had even forgot to consider the fact that Erika had been saved by Michelle before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhm&hellip;&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;Did you really think I would go right to patrolling after what had happened to you? Because I didn&rsquo;t think so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got a point there,&rdquo; Fred sighted, before continuing. &ldquo;Sorry, I overreacted a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s ok. I didn&rsquo;t know that your sister could&rsquo;ve used my help. What happened to her?&rdquo; Amanda feigned interest, but the truth was she knew the story in and out already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She volunteered to be a hostage during a bank robbery. As I said, the other supergirl dealt with it; scared the hell out of the robbers in the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would she volunteer for that?&rdquo; Amanda was curious, this part was indeed new to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying!&rdquo; Amanda blurted out before she even realized how she knew that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Super senses, remember? I can see and hear the little hints of a lie all over your body. The quickening heartbeat, the increasing amount of sweat, the slightest shake in your voice. You may be able to fool most people, but not me. You know exactly why your sister volunteered to be the hostage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; Fred looked still a bit dumbfounded, but he had clearly regained his composure. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making a fuss because of a little lie but, at the same time, you fail to see the reason behind it: My sister&rsquo;s none of your business. You don&rsquo;t need to know why she does what, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you overreacting again? I was just proud to be able to tell a small lie like this right away and you blow up in my face because of this,&rdquo; Amanda tried to disarm the situation. Talking about lies and secrets was naturally a tricky topic for him right now, but &ldquo;Devil&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t know about that. She wondered if she could user her supposed lack of knowledge to cause Fred to make a slip of the tongue and reveal why he had cheated on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, now it&rsquo;s my fault that you yell at me like a psycho.&rdquo; Fred didn&rsquo;t buckle down now and a part of Amanda was actually proud of him for this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s talking. First you blame me for not being there when your sister was in trouble – even though you said yourself that everything turned out fine. And when I ask what happened, you lie to me. If you don&rsquo;t want to talk about it, just say so. It&rsquo;s better than being lied to.&rdquo; Amanda did her best not to smile wickedly on the idea that she used Fred&rsquo;s very own arguing against him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright I get it,&rdquo; Fred admitted, looking away from her.</p>
<p>After a few seconds it became clear that he wouldn&rsquo;t continue, so Amanda took the initiative. &ldquo;About your offer the other day, did you really intend to sell that car of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred turned back towards her with a shocked expression, a hint of anger in his eyes. Amanda rewarded his defiant look by sticking out her tongue a bit. Yeah, you won&rsquo;t be able to lie yourself out of this one.</p>
<p>It took a few seconds until he let out a sigh. &ldquo;Okay, you got me here, I didn&rsquo;t intent to sell it. But since I can&rsquo;t afford to repair it, I thought that would be the best idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Too bad I can&rsquo;t afford to buy it right now. I wish I could at least repay you some of the damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind that.&rdquo; Fred waved his hand dismissively. &ldquo;There&rsquo;re more important things than a car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Amanda said while she involuntarily smiled. Fred was obviously referring to their recent make-up. Then she got an idea. &ldquo;So how should I repay you then? Last time you mentioned something about you breaking up, right? How about I take care of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred&rsquo;s eyes widened as he heard that. &ldquo;W-what are you implying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Amanda answered, still smiling wickedly. &ldquo;You sure have something that you&rsquo;d like me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Fred gulped and his voice became shaky.</p>
<p>With her improved hearing, Amanda could pick up how her boyfriend&rsquo;s heart began beating faster and faster as a clear sign of his nervousness. She even noticed the slight layer of sweat forming on his forehead. Amanda enjoyed the effect she had on him and decided to tease him further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? You said you broke up, right? I could try to give a good word for you with her or maybe I could… take over.&rdquo; Amanda&rsquo;s smile had turned into a seductive grin as she said that, coming ever closer to his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-We are back together,&rdquo; Fred tried to increase the distance by pressing his head into the pillow behind – with limited success. &ldquo;So you see, there&rsquo;s nothing you need to do&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you,&rdquo; Amanda giggled, &ldquo;But it seems like you may still want to know the answer to an earlier question about what I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, seriously don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; Fred was panicking at these implications – obviously aware that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to resist her physically – or mentally.</p>
<p>His resistance actually surprised Amanda. Fred had cheated on her before, so she expected him to warm up to the idea of doing so again. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I can clearly see that a part of you wants to take up my offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred closed his eyes, trying to collect himself. &ldquo;S-Stop it. We just got back together&hellip; this would be a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda reached out with her hand and slowly caressed his face. Fred visibly tensed up upon her touch. &ldquo;You really love her, huh?&rdquo; Amanda&rsquo;s expression softened as she said that, the fact that her boyfriend would still prefer her to a superpowered version of herself made her feel much more comfortable than the sight of Fred struggling against her.</p>
<p>Fred opened his eyes and nodded.</p>
<p>The two of them looked into each other&rsquo;s eye&rsquo;s for some time. Amanda noticed how Fred seemed to calm down a bit, the signs of panic disappearing leaving him merely on edge. The superpowered redhead on the other hand felt herself getting… aroused? Her body obviously didn&rsquo;t care about the fact that Fred didn&rsquo;t know who she really was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you… sweating?&rdquo; Fred eventually asked, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like it. Not that it would be a surprise.&rdquo; In fact, Amanda was rather alarmed by this development. Earlier she had run in her normal form at top speed from here to her apartment without breaking a single drop of sweat, now she could feel herself beginning to perspire even though she was in her super form now not to mention far from exerting herself. At least it didn&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable, and Amanda was actually enjoying it along with her increasing … oh my god.</p>
<p>Amanda took a closer look at Fred and realized that it was just as she feared. His eyes looked a bit dazed, his breathing got deeper and his heartbeat quickened again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the …? Wow you smell good,&rdquo; he exclaimed as if to confirm it.</p>
<p>It was obvious now, Amanda hadn&rsquo;t begun to sweat because of exhaustion or nervousness, but because of her arousal. And her sweat was laden with pheromones … super pheromones. Unfortunately, she realized this one moment to late. Before she knew it, she leaned over to kiss him.</p>
<p>There was no resistance this time. Entranced by her super pheromones, Fred answered her kiss with the same passion she displayed. Amanda couldn&rsquo;t blame him for giving in as she couldn&rsquo;t stop herself either. Somewhere in the back of her head her rational side was screaming to her that she wasn&rsquo;t doing him a favor, trying to remind her why she had pulled back just a few moments earlier. But this part had no say in the manner. Right now a primal urge began to dominate her thoughts, an urge that didn&rsquo;t care about the lies that come with a secret identity. She hovered above him while their lips were still locked onto each other, slowly disintegrating her costume as she began to remove his hospital gown.</p>
<p>Jacob Spencer strolled through the streets trying to clear his head. It seemed that, with every day, a new piece of outrageous news would arrive, forcing him to rethink his whole concept of reality. The news about superpowered women – as unbelievable as they were – had started out quite positively. Unfortunately each passing day seemed to increase their number – and not in a good way. First a blonde that played the role of a superhero, then a redhead that seemed a bit troublesome, but ultimately helpful – if only as a source of information. After all her accident had let her to inform the victim a bit about what she can do – namely to temporary share her powers with others. This turned out to be one vital piece of information considering the newest find: a severely injured man who – of this Jacob was certain by now – had been raped by a woman of comparable power. Jacob sighed, there was a clear pattern here and he didn&rsquo;t like its direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a noise if you want to live, bitch!&rdquo; a male voice hissed from a side-road.</p>
<p>Jacob went by the side-road with the same speed as he spotted, through the corner of his eyes, a man leaning over a woman, cornering her against the wall. From the way he held his arm, Jacob figured he was wielding a knife, but his opportunity to look was only short – and right now the masquerade that he was just a random passersby took priority over that. Once he had passed the opening of the street, Jacob counted the number of steps he made, slowly switching to sneaking before eventually turning around. Mentally preparing himself for the action that was about to happen, he reached for his gun and approached the corner he had passed. Just as Jacob was about to reach it, he could hear a loud gunshot coming out of it.</p>
<p>Damn, he thought. So it wasn&rsquo;t a knife but a gun. Jacob approached the corner with even more care now, wondering if he had been spotted and the gun would be pointed at him as soon as he looked around the corner. Another gunshot. And one more. Realizing that they weren&rsquo;t fired in his direction, Jacob rushed around the corner and aimed his gun ready to fire at once – but what he saw was different from what he expected. The man stood there, his hand shaking – not from the shots he had fired just now – but from witnessing their utter lack of damage. Jacob recognized the reason immediately: it was the blonde superwoman he had seen on a video made by a surveillance camera two days ago. She stood between the man and his victim and had obviously taken the opportunity to display her invulnerability.</p>
<p>This was truly a sight to behold. The black leotard seemed made specifically for her body, showing of her unreal curves. For some reason, that Jacob couldn&rsquo;t put his finger on, this outfit inspired awe more than lust. Even in the darkness of the street this woman seemed to radiate an inner light. At the same time she also gave off a caring aura, an unspoken promise that everything could be fine as long as she was there. Yes, her outfit was meant to be practical, not to show off how far beyond mere mortals she was – that was either a bonus or a necessary evil. It took all of Jacob’s willpower not to waste precious time staring at her magnificent body in this situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-what are you?&rdquo; the man cried out as the blonde approached him steadily. He was even unable to try for another shot before she reached for his gun and took it away. Jacob could hear a metallic groaning as the gun deformed under her grip. The man snapped, taking out a knife with his other hands and tried to stab the blonde.</p>
<p>Even though Jacob knew that the blonde would laugh off a knife as much as she had the gunshots, his instincts kicked in and he fired at the culprit&rsquo;s hand, hoping to disarm him with one shot. Jacob was a pretty good shooter, so he was all the more surprised to see that he had missed the guy entirely.</p>
<p>The blonde, on the other hand, didn&rsquo;t seem to bother much with the knife, catching it with her bare hand, then squeezing it similar to how she had squeezed the gun – deforming it to the point of uselessness as well. With a loud clang, the knife fell to the ground, now Jacob realized that the gun was also lying there – when had she dropped it? Jacob was still asking himself this – as the blonde goddess had decided to go into the offensive for once, shoving her enemy in a leisurely way … across the street where he slammed into the wall and sank down – unconscious.</p>
<p>Jacob stared at the results of the battle with awe. He had seen this woman take down armed enemies over and over again, but seeing it with his own eyes was a totally different thing. It took him a while to realize that she had shifted her attention to him. Her blue eyes clearly visible in the dark as she held up her hand to reveal a bullet. &ldquo;Want it back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob&rsquo;s eyes widened as he realized that this wasn&rsquo;t one of the bullets that the other man had fired at this blonde goddess, but the one he himself had fired at him. She caught it right out of the air and I didn&rsquo;t even see it! Now he noticed that he was still pointing his gun at her, and that she didn&rsquo;t know that he was a cop! He hastily lowered his gun in order not to provoke any hostility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to be scared, Detective. I saw from the trajectory of your shot that you were aiming at his hand, but I thought that this kind of injury was a bit over the top for him.&rdquo; She
gestured towards the unconscious man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know that I was …&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;X-Ray vision,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;I can see your badge even when you&rsquo;re not presenting it.&rdquo; She then turned to the woman she had just saved. &ldquo;This man&rsquo;s a police detective, he will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The goddess suddenly started to rise off the floor. Jacob had seen this one on the video as well, but just like the rest, seeing the real deal left him awestruck for too long to even form a single question. And there were many things this woman could&rsquo;ve answered for him.</p>
<p>High above the skyline, Michelle came to a halt. The blonde woman let out a relieved sigh, knowing that nobody would hear her there. Three times the mugger had shot her, twice he had hit her breasts. It had taken all her willpower not to show how pleasurable these gunshots had been. Normally this wouldn&rsquo;t have been that big of an issue, but Michelle had decided to supercharge her senses during the whole situation. This had given her the reaction necessary to catch a bullet out of the air, but it had also increased the sensation when she had been hit. Allowing her senses to tune down on merely faster than human level, she scanned the city for the next thing to do. After all, she was brimming with power right now. Michelle had followed her boyfriend’s advice and drunk multiple doses of the potion before going out on patrol, so she had more than enough to spare right now and since she had only stopped little crimes so far, she yearned for a bigger challenge. The young woman was aware that, due to the existence of other superpowered people out there, this bigger challenge would come sooner or later. The question was whether or not she would be prepared when the time came.</p>
<p>What was even worse was that her ability to see the super energy didn&rsquo;t seem to mix well with her other forms of super sight. She had found Amanda earlier without a problem but, even though her best friend was in her super form, Michelle wasn&rsquo;t able to make out this particular energy inside her friend at this distance. Michelle had refrained from testing out these limits in order not to disturb her privacy – after all Amanda had been talking to her boyfriend at that time. Long story short, even though she had the advantage of being able to see whether someone was super at first sight, she couldn&rsquo;t put this ability to good use by scanning the city from above.</p>
<p>Finding no other indication about a crime she could stop, Michelle wondered what to do next. Go back to the mountains to train her powers? Look at another city to see if she can be of use there? Fly around the world just for the heck of it? This sounded like a good idea, after all her flight powers were the most versatile and should receive priority when it comes to being mastered. Without any further thought she began flying eastward. Training her flight power not only was a priority to her because of its versatility, but also because she simply enjoyed using it. She screamed in joy as the wind tugged at her body, while she pushed herself ever closer to the speed of sound and, with a loud boom, she went beyond.</p>
<p>An awkward silence ruled the small hospital room for a long time after Amanda and Fred had finished their act. They were both lying under the covers of the small hospital bed, with Amanda lying on top of her clueless boyfriend. Even though their heads were right next to each other, they looked in opposite directions. They both had cleared their heads again and with this the gravity of this situation came crashing down on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This … was a big mistake,&rdquo; Fred eventually said.</p>
<p>Amanda couldn&rsquo;t disagree, but at the same time it felt bad to hear it. To her, it had just been making love with her boyfriend, but for him it bordered on rape. The fact that she had been just as entranced as he, did little to comfort her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry&hellip;&rdquo; she couldn&rsquo;t find any better words. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what came over me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This really puts me into a difficult situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I already said I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t sound like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mean, I only wanted to help. And besides you didn&rsquo;t look like you didn&rsquo;t enjoy it.&rdquo; Amanda retorted. &ldquo;I said before that these powers are new to me and so are these … urges. You just got caught up in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is one way to put it. Another would be your talent for screwing up whenever you have to adapt to something unexpected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even though Fred&rsquo;s voice sounded more joking than threatening, Amanda clearly felt a sense of dread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked, now turning to face him and seeing that he was looking at her as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should drop this farce, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;How did you&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My phone. After you dropped me, you used it to call the ambulance, but you made the mistake of calling your best friend right afterward. I noticed it later, when I decided to call you after your visit here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew it that long? Why … why didn&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo; Amanda was feeling her face becoming red considering the stupid mistake she had made two days ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really have to ask? There&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t want you to know, so I ignored anything that hinted towards your identity. But after this, I can&rsquo;t pretend that you&rsquo;re someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it sure makes things easier. I&rsquo;m not a good liar after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The awkwardness had evaporated, and the mood had turned to what it should&rsquo;ve been like from the beginning: Two lovers lying next to each other, locked into each other’s gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&hellip; I take it you want to know what exactly happened to me,&rdquo; Amanda began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually I think it&rsquo;s better that you keep the details to yourself. As I said, there&rsquo;s still something that I want to keep for me, so it would only be fair if you did the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously? You learn that your girlfriend has superpowers, but you still want to keep it to yourself? What can be so important that you wouldn&rsquo;t even tell me about it? Don&rsquo;t you have any trust in your girlfriend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do, but … trust me when I say I&rsquo;ve got my reasons. But can you honestly say that you being responsible for my condition did not play its part in us getting back together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t deny that I felt guilty about hurting you. But trust me when I say it&rsquo;s not the reason I got back together with you. I still love you and honestly I felt flattered when you fought for me despite the odds being against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a relief. But why did you confront me in this form at all? You should&rsquo;ve known that you&rsquo;d end up being the prime suspect if you come over to trash my car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda went silent for a second. For days she had asked herself the same thing, yet the answer somehow had escaped her. &ldquo;To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t really have a plan back then. I just enjoyed my new powers, flew over the city and when I spotted you, I simply came over. It&rsquo;s funny, even though I had been royally pissed at you the whole time before, somehow I just wanted to meet you again. Now that I think about it, maybe my feelings for you were much stronger than I expected – or wanted to admit at that moment. I always thought that cheating on me would be a deal breaker, but look at me, I&rsquo;m more interested in the reasons behind it than in the fact itself&hellip; that sounds weird, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it does. But it sounds awfully like you to make strange decisions, if you didn&rsquo;t have time to think things through beforehand. It&rsquo;s just my luck to have you even though I don&rsquo;t deserve you.&rdquo; He reached out to kiss her – for the first time this evening – and Amanda happily complied.</p>
<p>For the first time in days, Amanda really felt connected to her boyfriend and at the same time felt herself beginning to sweat again. &ldquo;Ready for round two?&rdquo; she teased.</p>
<p>Michelle couldn&rsquo;t believe it as she approached the west coast, not even an hour had passed and she was already at the last end of her trip around the world. She had taken this opportunity to test her maximum speed – unfortunately she had no idea how fast that was, but being able to fly around the world in an hour surely spoke for itself. Michelle was actually surprised that there WAS a maximum speed at all. So far she had considered that she could just go faster and faster as long as her energy supply allowed it, but this time she had finally found the limit her body was capable of. With her increased energy supply, Michelle had developed a certain feeling for flying at her top speed and learned that she became slightly more efficient the longer she did so.</p>
<p>Just as she began pondering whether she should set out for another lap at top speed, the blonde woman spotted a cloud of black smoke. In the darkness of night, this was quite a feat – after all every cloud was bound to appear as black. Within milliseconds Michelle had discovered the source of this cloud: An airplane, or more precisely one of its engines, that was clearly malfunctioning.</p>
<p>Michelle immediately changed her course. She had already cleared half the distance to the plane before she even realized how serious this situation was. If this plane was about to crash, she was probably the only hope for its passengers – and now that she was aware of that, the survival of every passenger became top priority. Not wanting to waste even a single second, Michelle activated her super senses to their fullest. Instantly, the world around her seemed to slow down to an almost complete halt. Using her X-Ray vision, she counted 203 people on board even before assessing the damage to the engine. Of course Michelle lacked the necessary know-how to even consider repairing it, but her improved senses made her aware that the other engine was running in danger of failing as well. The crew had already begun preparations for an emergency landing as they tried to control the planes' unavoidable descent.</p>
<p>While Michelle was still trying to figure out if and how she could be of help, a loud bang (at least that&rsquo;s how it sounded to her) made her aware that her time was running short. The second engine was failing, spewing black smoke in the air in the process. The plane answered by a sudden drop in height and with her heightened senses, Michelle watched how every person on it became aware how serious things were. The flight crew struggled to keep the passengers calm, to avoid a panic. And even though the passengers kept their calm on the outside, Michelle was painfully aware of the fear they felt, a fear that was about to grip her as well even though she wasn&rsquo;t the one in danger here.</p>
<p>Shaking her head, Michelle tried to get herself focused on the task at hand: How to keep the plane from crashing. Repairing the engines was out of question, even though her improved senses made it easy for her to determine what was broken, she lacked both the skill and the spare parts to do something about it – not to mention time. The only obvious solution was to lift the plane by herself which sounded much easier said than done. So far the heavy objects Michelle had carried were massive boulders that couldn&rsquo;t possibly collapse under their own weight. A plane, on the other hand, was a much more complex construction, far too big for a small person like her to lift. And that wasn&rsquo;t even considering the fact that she would need an insane amount of strength to do so.</p>
<p>By the time she had thought that, Michelle was already underneath the plane, searching for a place that might actually allow her to get a hold. But wherever she looked, the metal plates seemed too fragile to actually hold the planes' weight. Damn, she thought. There had to be a place for her to lift the plane without destroying it. Her mind raced – and considering her activated heightened senses this really meant something. Even though her knowledge about the physics involved was average at best, her intelligence made up for it and the answer popped up in her head. She needed to somehow increase the area over which to apply the necessary pressure to lift the plane. Fortunately every plane had a designated place where upward forces were supposed to attack: The wings. Michelle&rsquo;s head turned left and right. With both engines out, she would need to lift on both sides simultaneously – but how? Even with her 6'3&quot; body her arms weren&rsquo;t long enough for this – wait a second.</p>
<p>Michelle&rsquo;s blue eyes widened as she thought of the answer. Looking once more at both sides, she made sure that she was in the center of the plane right between the wings. Then she looked forward and downward, seeing the ground approaching steadily – she still had a bit time, but she needed to hurry. With a though, she expanded her costume from behind herself, forcing the strange substance that was part of her body to run along the underside of the plane and fill the underside of its wings. The idea was pretty simple. After all, the super power she needed to lift something while flying was not her strength but her flight ability. In other words she didn&rsquo;t need her muscles to apply pressure but applying her super energy to her costume would do the trick.</p>
<p>Now that the problem with the way to apply the necessary force was dealt with, another more pressing problem came back to Michelle: her own limits. While she had been capable of lifting heavy rocks, she had already felt her energy consumption increase significantly when she did so. Not to mention, that she had just recently learned that there was a maximum amount of flight energy she could use at a time. It was entirely possible that she was simply too weak to lift the plane. Shaking her head Michelle abandoned this thought. Don&rsquo;t even think about failing, there are lives depending on you! With this thought, she began to set her plan in motion and increased the amount of flight energy she used and channeled it through her – for the lack of a better word – wings. As she steadily increased the force with which she pushed against the wings, Michelle soon felt the limit of what she could do approaching. The entire plane groaned as the young woman&rsquo;s effort slowed down its descent.</p>
<p>All too soon Michelle was pushing with full force while realizing that the descent was slowing, it wasn&rsquo;t slow enough for a safe landing. Michelle&rsquo;s heart dropped, but she refused to accept this. Concentrating harder she tried to squeeze out as much flight energy as possible. She went through the basics once again in her head. Each cell in her body was involved when it came to using her flight powers, but there were indeed cells that weren&rsquo;t active at this time. Right. A certain amount of muscle cells were still dormant, only meant to awaken if the necessary muscle mass was needed. Intuitively Michelle awakened these cells to add to the amount of super energy she was converting to flight energy at this moment. She didn&rsquo;t grow the extra muscle mass, though, but instead forced these cells to concentrate on this one task – not even sure how she commanded single cells to do her bidding. Right now she was just happy that it worked and the descent slowed down even further. Using every cell in her body Michelle urged her body to increase the output even further. Unfortunately it seemed that her costume was only able to use apply the flight energy, not generate it like the rest of her body. The feeling of being at her limit was similar to what she knew from her &lsquo;normal&rsquo; limits.</p>
<p>As she pushed herself beyond her limit, Michelle felt a sensation, she thought impossible in her super form: Pain. It began slowly at first, but with her super senses active it felt several leagues worse. Her body was scolding her for going beyond her limits and, slowly but surely, this scolding became a loud scream that urged her to stop this madness. But Michelle wouldn&rsquo;t stop. Too clear she remembered the scared faces of the people whose lives she just shouldered. And her stubbornness was rewarded. Along with her pain, the amount of flight powers she generated increased. The incredible amount of energy caused her &lsquo;wings&rsquo; to start glowing slightly, but Michelle didn&rsquo;t notice about that fact. Her eyes remained focused on the ever-approaching ground and the ever-slowing speed with which it drew closer. Their descent had reached a tolerable speed, but Michelle had little time to be happy about her success. After all, she used up a tremendous amount of her super energy and noticed that her supply would reach its end soon. She was glad that she had drunk the extra doses before going on patrol; otherwise she wouldn&rsquo;t even have been able to try anything here. Still, it was going to be a very close call, from what she could tell Michelle would transform back to normal right before they reached the ground.</p>
<p>Realizing that her current actions would result in a fall without being invulnerable seemed to intensify her body&rsquo;s urge to stop what she was doing. Her survival instincts clashed with her plan to save these people and her thoughts raced to find a solution for this dilemma. There was only one possibility for her: Two days ago Michelle had noticed how her control over her powers had increased, resulting her using her energy more efficiently. If she could just increase her control a little bit, her supply would suffice for a safe landing. Somehow the fear inside her began to subside, as if her instincts were accepting the plan she had come up with. Michelle focused on how she was converting the super energy to flight energy. While first she had only cared about converting as much super energy as possible, she now found the time to actually tweak the process, to understand it a bit further. About two minutes had passed since she began pushing against the plane, but to Michelle this short timeframe felt like an eternity already. This was mainly because she was using her super senses through all of this. And, while the pain of her efforts felt much more intense this way, it also allowed her to gain a deeper insight on what she was doing there.</p>
<p>Michelle was so focused; she barely noticed the ground coming ever nearer. She vaguely recognized the fact that it was an open space and there was a long and broad road that sufficed for the plane. What she didn&rsquo;t realize was that she was landing the plane on an airport, and that there was already an emergency crew dispatched.</p>
<p>A shock brought her out of her trance as the plane touched the ground. It took her a whole second to recognize this fact as she heard … clapping? Screaming – not of fear or pain, but of joy. Michelle turned around to find the source of these sounds – and found the passengers on the plane celebrating their survival. She had done it! Michelle allowed herself to descend as well, disintegrating the now useless &lsquo;wings&rsquo; she had created in the process. Landing on the ground, she could feel the pain from her exertion begin to dissipate as she allowed her senses to return to normal. The young woman was still a bit dazed as she recovered, her heartbeat bursting with pride at what she had achieved. She looked around. There was already quite a crowd – mostly the emergency team that was supposed to help evacuating the plane – and her presence hadn&rsquo;t gone unnoticed. She could already see a few of them picking up their phones or even dedicated camera&rsquo;s to take a picture of her&hellip;</p>
<p>Without a second thought Michelle took back to the sky, her body hadn&rsquo;t even finished recovering as the pain from earlier came back with full force. She didn&rsquo;t care, her head was spinning and her energy supply was nearing its end. Gritting her teeth, the blonde woman headed straight back to her apartment.</p>
