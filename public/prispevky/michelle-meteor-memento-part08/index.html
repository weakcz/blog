            <p>Erika finished her drink while she calmly looked around the bar. Since it was Monday there weren&rsquo;t many people there, making it harder for her to find a man to… relieve some stress.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this wasn&rsquo;t what had kept her from finding one. Yet, the real reason was sitting in another booth looking in her direction while at the same time trying not to be obvious about it. Normally Erika would have interpreted this behavior as interest in her, and subsequently start flirting with him. But Erika had already tried that yesterday, when he had questioned her about her role as a hostage in a bank robbery. And since this cop had already rejected her advances, his continuous peeking could only mean he tailed her. Was he still suspicious that she was somehow involved in the robbery? No, it must&rsquo;ve been because of her encounter with this strange woman that had saved her. Eventually, Erika made the &lsquo;I see you&rsquo; gesture which prompted the man to stand up and approach her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it would be better if you&rsquo;d let someone that I don&rsquo;t recognize tail me, Detective Spencer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; he said with a smile. &ldquo;By the way, call me Jacob. I&rsquo;m off-duty right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t deny that you&rsquo;re tailing me, Jacob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I highly doubt that you would believe me if I did. It was a coincidence that I met you here, but once I spotted you, well &lsquo;guilty as charged&rsquo;. That blonde friend of yours earlier seemed like you-know-who at first glance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Erika burst into laughter. &ldquo;Amanda? She&rsquo;s about a foot smaller than you-know-who, not to mention far more down-to-earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said: At first glance. She didn&rsquo;t seem to be in the best of moods there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh really? I think she did pretty well considering the recent events in her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of events do you mean?&rdquo; the tone of Jacob&rsquo;s voice made it clear that he already knew - or suspected - a few of these.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well her boyfriend - my brother - is lying in the hospital thanks to this redheaded bitch.&rdquo; Erika purposely didn&rsquo;t mention the short break-up Amanda and Fred had gone through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Redheaded bitch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t your scientist friend fill you in on this? It seems like there&rsquo;s more than one woman flying around. My brother ruined his knee when this bitch let him fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thompson? I knew he visited your brother, but he didn&rsquo;t call me afterwards. Must&rsquo;ve been too busy preparing for his big date.&rdquo; Jacob chuckled, but Erika noticed that it was forced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of which, is there any news about blondie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob shrugged. &ldquo;She stopped a few muggings from what I&rsquo;ve heard, but nothing big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of bi … look at that hunk.&rdquo; Erika gestured at a man she had spotted.</p>
<p>She had been looking around the bar during the whole conversation, so she had noticed the newcomer almost immediately. He was at least 6'6&quot; tall and quite muscular.This guy was a bit too good-looking for her to consider, since it provoked far too much competition. Sure enough, he was soon standing in the middle of an all-female group, burdened with the sadistic task of having to choose. To Erika&rsquo;s surprise he clearly chose the weakest member of the group - a small, frail Asian girl in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a Cinderella story. I bet ten bucks that he was hired by the others so that the paralyzed girl had some fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Erika nodded. It became painfully obvious which of the women were true friends of the Asian and who wasn&rsquo;t. One group was talking to him with a more concerned expression, they obviously didn&rsquo;t like the idea of leaving their friend alone with a stranger. The other group was trying to prevent that from happening by - unsuccessfully - flirting with him. Eventually he moved her out of the bar in her wheelchair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s really hired, wouldn&rsquo;t that be illegal?&rdquo; Erika asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen much more dubious things that are legal today. For example the cost-to-success-ratio a certain Prof. Christopher Harland has with his attempts to cure this Harland-Syndrome that was named after him. Nine out of ten of his patients didn&rsquo;t survive his treatment and they have to pay a ridiculous amount for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Erika&rsquo;s expression darkened. &ldquo;Way to kill the mood. I&rsquo;m talking enough about money at work&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the first rays of light shone through the window, James opened his eyes and realized that he wasn&rsquo;t in his own room. For a second he was confused, but when he spotted the brunette head of hair resting on his chest, everything came back to him. Last night he had a date with Michelle Jenkins, the woman whose bed he was lying in - and whose naked body was lying on top of his. He hadn&rsquo;t expected for things to go this fast. Michelle had seemed to be the kind of woman who would wait for at least one more date - and James had been convinced she was worth waiting for. One might say that he got lucky, but the truth was that he had hit the jackpot. From the moment their lips had met yesterday, their bodies had moved on auto-pilot. James smiled as he recalled himself carrying Michelle upstairs to her apartment, a ridiculously dangerous feat, but Michelle&rsquo;s body had proven to be so light that he had succeeded without problem. This must&rsquo;ve been where the saying &lsquo;love gives you wings&rsquo; applied, even though the explanation was probably much more mundane. He most likely ignored the strain on his body due to an adrenaline rush, not only when he carried her upstairs, but also during the whole act that followed. To his surprise, Michelle seemed to be much stronger than her petite body implied - the same juxtaposition that someone with such a sweet and nice personality had such passion in bed. Beware the nice ones indeed. Not that James would complain about that. From his perspective the last night had been the best of his entire life - their lovemaking had been out of this world. It was as if both of them knew exactly what the other wanted. There had been no spoken word, no clear gesture, but for some reason whatever he did seemed to be just the thing Michelle had wished him to do at that moment, while she in turn would do exactly what he was fantasizing about in that very moment. James had no reasonable explanation for this effect, but truth be told, he didn&rsquo;t care. All he cared about was lying right on top of him.</p>
<p>James reached and brushed her hair away, so that he could see her face. He was extra careful not to wake her up as he marveled at the cuteness of her sleeping face. Her eyes were closed and her lips showed a slight smile as she rested on his chest. Ever since he had first met her, Michelle seemed to amaze him with her beauty whenever they met, and this time was no exception. Only this time he could savor her beauty without his speechlessness making him appear like a dumbfounded schoolboy. What had he done for him to wake up next to such a woman? Was he even worthy of breathing the same air as her? Not to mention air that carried her scent? To watch this beautiful face with lips begging to be kissed. For a second James pondered leaning forward and stealing a kiss from the sleeping angel. But before he could even lean forward, Michelle&rsquo;s face seemed to shoot into his direction. All James could do was open his mouth in time before her tongue entered it. Like last night, he had an idea that she had promptly set into motion. Suddenly he was aware that Michelle had only pretended to be asleep, being awake for about the same time as he was. As mysterious as this sudden insight was, as little did James care about it right now. Their kiss lasted for a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; both Michelle and James said in unison, and burst into laughter because of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&hellip; uhm,&rdquo; Michelle seemed a bit lost. &ldquo;To be honest, this is kind of a first time to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What? James couldn&rsquo;t believe the idea that Michelle might have been a virgin before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean this is the first time I woke up next to somebody else. How do we continue from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that she mentioned it, James was no expert on this front, either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things moved much faster than I anticipated. But if there&rsquo;s one thing I know it&rsquo;s that I don&rsquo;t want it to end here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; Michelle said, her brown eyes focused on his. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange, even though we met just two days ago &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;… it feels like we&rsquo;ve always known each other,&rdquo; James finished the sentence.</p>
<p>Michelle looked surprised at first, but her expression became all the happier over the course of two seconds. For the fragment of a second, her eyes looked sideways to her nightstand.</p>
<p>James followed her short look and saw this strange plant standing there. It wasn&rsquo;t really surprising for him not to know this particular plant as plants weren&rsquo;t his specialty, but somehow it still seemed weird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of plant is this?&rdquo; James asked.</p>
<p>A wave of concern washed over Michelle&rsquo;s face. She seemed to regret looking at the plant and causing this topic to come up. She took a few seconds before answering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be honest, I&rsquo;ve got no idea. Just found the seed on the sidewalk and planted it. I&rsquo;ve grown kind of attached to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James left it at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although&hellip;&rdquo; Michelle took another sideway glance at the plant. A naughty smile formed on her face, but it turned into disappointment as she took a look at the clock next to the plant. It took no genius to figure out the reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time for work?&rdquo; James realized he shared her disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least not enough time for what I had in mind. Seems like it&rsquo;ll have to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when will that be?&rdquo; James almost pleaded. The idea that the two of them had to separate was even more terrifying than it was last night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; Michelle teased. &ldquo;When are you free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could be here at six.&rdquo; Of course he meant tonight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, it&rsquo;ll be a long night,&rdquo; Michelle whispered.</p>
<p>Oh boy, she really knows how to tease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it&rsquo;ll be hard to concentrate on work today. I&rsquo;ll spend all day missing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michelle smiled and kissed him again. She then grabbed a single hair of hers, ripped it out and presented it to James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This should help you at work. After all you won&rsquo;t miss me if you carry a part of me with you, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something told James that this was more than just a silly romantic gesture.</p>
<p>In the end, it was James who had to leave early in order to get a change of clothes before work. Once he was gone, Michelle fell back on her bed, reminiscing their date and its outcome. Besides this one situation where both of them were a bit nervous about each other, everything went borderline perfect. With a big smile she remembered their passionate lovemaking and began wondering how things would develop from here. She loved him, and she knew he loved her back, but there was also the part of her not being exactly normal. The way she seemed to be able to read his mind was one definite clue about that, and strangely, she hadn&rsquo;t been in her super form when it happened. This was disturbing. Michelle had been aware that the changes the potion had done to her body were quite deep-rooted, but she hadn&rsquo;t expected to have any kind of superpower in her normal form. What&rsquo;s more, how could she keep these powers and her other identity a secret if they started to pop up in her normal form as well? Amanda&rsquo;s words from two days before came back to her: she should tell him as soon as possible. Actually, Michelle didn&rsquo;t need to think about her best friends advice to know that she didn&rsquo;t want to keep it a secret. Things would be a lot easier for them if he knew what was going on - after all, she still intended to go out on patrol at night, and having to lie to her boyfriend every time she did that just felt wrong. Boyfriend… Michelle still couldn&rsquo;t believe that she now had one.</p>
<p>James had barely arrived at his apartment as his phone rang. Three month of boredom and now the police had him on speed-dial. Unsurprisingly, it was Det. Spencer who called to meet him at a certain restaurant. Since he hadn&rsquo;t had breakfast yet, it only seemed practical to have it during an official meeting with the police. After a quick change of clothes, he made his way to said restaurant. His heart jumped at the idea that he might run into his girlfriend much faster than expected. But the closer he got to his destination, the more this anticipation faded, being replaced by a strange awareness that she wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Once he entered the place, James looked around for familiar faces to find that Michelle was indeed not among them. He located Det. Spencer sitting at a table and made his way towards him. With a grunt he sat down on his chair. For the first time today James noticed how sore his muscles were. As if he had spent the night working out instead of… ok now he got it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like your date last night was quite a success,&rdquo; Jacob began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could say that&hellip; Wait how did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ear-to-ear-smile of yours practically screams out &lsquo;I got laid&rsquo;.&rdquo; Jacob explained with a smile that was almost as wide as James&rsquo;s. Was he proud to show off his perceptive skills or had he been &lsquo;working out&rsquo; last night as well? James decided he didn&rsquo;t really want to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So why the sudden invitation for breakfast?&rdquo; James tried to change the subject.</p>
<p>The smile on Jacob&rsquo;s face vanished as he took on a much more serious expression. &ldquo;It seems like this whole superpowered women story has taken a turn for the worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waitress appeared to take their order. James recognized her. Amanda Steward. He had met her yesterday in the hospital, one of the few civilians that even knew about the existence of superpowered women. Jacob also eyed her in a &lsquo;do I know you?&rsquo; kind of way. While they placed their order, James felt Amanda&rsquo;s judging gaze upon him. Was it really that obvious that he had sex last night?</p>
<p>Eventually Amanda left the table and Jacob continued with the topic at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard about that redhead that crippled this Ryley guy. Sounds like it was an accident, and I clearly hope that it was one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was odd. Two days ago Jacob had suspected the hostage of being an accomplice of the bank robbers, and now he gave this redhead the benefit of a doubt?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, we know too little to make a better guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, but how about we try to guess a little? If this redhead underestimated her abilities it may be possible for others with the same kind of powers to do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there are more than these two,&rdquo; James knew that this became much more likely with the confirmation of a second superwoman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take the worst case scenario and assume that there&rsquo;s some kind of drug out there that gives its user superpowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be careful with these assumptions. Your conclusion will be useless if reality doesn&rsquo;t fit your assumptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob waved his hand dismissively. &ldquo;I know that. So let there be a way for people to get superpowers. In this case this means that they don&rsquo;t necessarily know how to use these powers, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>James nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So unless the person spends some time getting to know his or her powers, chances are high there&rsquo;s an accident like gripping something - or someone - with too much force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, maybe not. This might depend on the &lsquo;superpower&rsquo; that&rsquo;s used. The blonde superwoman seemed to have a talent for knocking out her enemies with a single punch without causing any permanent damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Jacob clearly hadn&rsquo;t considered this. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t rule out the possibility that these women might actually use too much force in certain situations - like sex for example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, James wondered if the other man was messing with him, but Jacob&rsquo;s tone was still serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we talking about the very possibility of these superwomen having sex with a normal man? In this case I don&rsquo;t have the slightest clue and have to say &lsquo;probably&rsquo;. It goes without saying that they can use this strength to hurt their partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob frowned. &ldquo;In a way, yes this is the topic. I&rsquo;m more interested in how likely these sex-accidents are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me. Don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s more important stuff to consider than silly theories about their sex-lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another frown. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m bringing this up just out of curiosity. Last night a man was found in critical condition. His injuries focus on the lower part of his body with several broken bones including his spine. This guy will be paralyzed from the waist down at best, and that&rsquo;s assuming he survives. You see, this may sound like a silly topic, but whether or not these women can control their strength marks the difference between a really unfortunate accident and assault - if not murder. And I&rsquo;m not even considering the possibility that he was raped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it even clear that he was injured during sex?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About 90% I&rsquo;d say. They found him half-naked in an alley, his clothes scattered around him and - the only real clue we have - vaginal fluids on his penis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the moment when Amanda arrived with their order.</p>
<p>Great, James thought. Now I&rsquo;ve got to eat breakfast with this image in mind. Good thing that I&rsquo;m not that easily disgusted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve got a DNA sample of the &lsquo;culprit&rsquo;?&rdquo; James continued once Amanda had left the table again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be waiting for you at your lab. My colleagues actually called me in the middle of the night for that. We can be damn happy that the doctors at the ER didn&rsquo;t just wash the evidence away before he went to surgery.&rdquo; Jacob yawned and in answer to that took a sip of his coffee.</p>
<p>James nodded in approval as he ate his breakfast.</p>
<p>Jacob had been true to his word. The DNA sample had been lying at his desk when James arrived at his workplace. He didn&rsquo;t waste any time and immediately began analyzing it. And indeed, the sample showed a similar mutation than the one of the dead prostitute that they referred to as &lsquo;Jane Doe&rsquo;. So there was a connection between her and the superpowered women after all. But how could this be explained? There were two seemingly invulnerable women on the one side and a dead woman on the other. Maybe the powers varied depending on the individual, or they could actually be temporary. This would support Jacob&rsquo;s theory about a superpower-granting drug. Quite a lot of information for a simple look through the microscope, but not nearly enough for James' taste.</p>
<p>A knock on the door interrupted James' trail of thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who entered seemed to be in his early fifties and as scrawny as you&rsquo;d expect from one of the most renowned scientists in the world. Prof. Christopher Harland was famous for two things: His obsession with his work and the methods with which he financed it. The genetic sickness that was mostly known as Harland-syndrome wasn&rsquo;t named after him because he discovered it, but because he&rsquo;s the only person who actually tried to cure it. Unfortunately, the chances of success are so slim, that he&rsquo;d long since lost any funding, which forced him to take desperate measures in order to get the necessary money for his research. In a nutshell he got paid by the human test subjects he tried his cure on. This would be fine if the costs weren&rsquo;t so ridiculously high and the success rate so low, meaning that the vast majority of his &lsquo;patients&rsquo; paid a fortune just to die. Of course, Harland had been sued several times because of it, but never had he been found guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Thompson, I presume?&rdquo; Harland asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, what can I do for you Prof. Harland?&rdquo; James forced himself to be polite. He didn&rsquo;t like Harland&rsquo;s practices, but right now Harland was the best source of information. After all, he had been hired specifically to research the mutated Jane Doe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard that you are investigating some… extraordinary individuals. And there&rsquo;s a possibility that these individuals are connected to the mutated woman I&rsquo;m examining right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct, even though I&rsquo;m a bit reserved about the possibility of a connection. I prefer not to jump to conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Then again it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to keep the eyes open for similarities. Unfortunately the organizational structure here doesn&rsquo;t encourage this. You&rsquo;ve got your assignment and I got mine, and the only communication here comes through the reports you turn in - of which I receive a copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James clenched his fist. He had expected that it would turn out this way: Harland would be informed about everything he reported while he still waited for the updated report as to what was found in or on the meteor. Harland seemed to notice this gesture as he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we both agree that it would be more efficient if this communication weren&rsquo;t so… formal or one-sided. If we were to talk about our recent findings and theories, we&rsquo;d both benefit of it, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not really. Since James was more or less kept out of the loop, he would be the only one to benefit here. Why would Harland come up with such a proposal then? James hadn&rsquo;t hidden that much information for a newcomer like him to notice, especially since none of it was relevant in any way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all ears. Do you have any theory that I should keep my eyes open for?&rdquo; James tested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact I do. Right now I&rsquo;m looking for a clue as to what caused the actual mutation. I&rsquo;m suspecting some kind of virus-like carrier that instead of injecting a single RNA strand includes the additional chromosomes into the nucleus. Following the virus-analogy, it could be possible that other people can get infected the way they might catch a flu. Of course, this is still a theory, as I haven&rsquo;t found any trace in Jane Doe yet. Maybe the carrier has long since left her system or got decomposed after its job was done, the fact that she&rsquo;s been dead for some time now doesn&rsquo;t help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. So you want me to get everybody Jane Doe had been in contact with to show up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harland shook his head. &ldquo;I already arranged for that to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said earlier, there might be a connection. Meaning that if there is a virus involved, these women you&rsquo;re chasing may actually be patient zero and thus possibly infecting other people they come into contact with. I suggest you arrange for anybody who came into contact with them to be examined. Maybe even quarantined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a few blood samples will suffice until we have any further clue. After all we don&rsquo;t want to cause a panic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say so,&rdquo; Harland shrugged his shoulders in a mocking way. &ldquo;Just let me know if you find something abnormal, ok?&rdquo; He turned around and left the room.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t even asked if James had found something new. Then again he clearly had read James' most recent report, otherwise he would still assume that there was only one superwoman. In other words, Harland had made the very mistake he had claimed to avoid, because had he really talked about James' findings, he would&rsquo;ve known about the newest DNA sample that was now in his possession.</p>
<p>James jumped of his chair and went back to analyze the sample. &ldquo;If there really is a viral carrier involved, this should be the first place to look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six o&rsquo;clock. Michelle was roaming through her apartment like a headless chicken. The day had gone by way to fast, leaving her with little to no time to actually prepare for this evening. All she had done was some grocery shopping to avoid another &lsquo;no breakfast&rsquo; morning. Michelle had no plan how this should go. James would arrive any second and the only point on Michelle&rsquo;s agenda was the talk. And despite her knowing for a fact that he loved her, she still was nervous about this particular topic.</p>
<p>Ding-dong.</p>
<p>Finally! Michelle rushed towards her apartment door and opened it. As expected James stood there, his face visibly lightening up as he spotted Michelle. Once again her nervousness was washed away by his sheer presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he said as Michelle beckoned him in.</p>
<p>Once he had entered and the door was closed, Michelle literally jumped him for a kiss that lasted well over a minute before she finally spoke. &ldquo;Missed you,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; was all James managed to answer.</p>
<p>Michelle immediately noticed that there was something bothering James. After the first euphoria of meeting again vanished, she could practically feel a strange sorrow on her boyfriend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo; Michelle asked directly. She didn&rsquo;t even waste any second speculating what might be the problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; uhm,&rdquo; James stammered.</p>
<p>Realizing she had rushed things a bit, Michelle slowly guided him to the living room. That should give him a few precious seconds to sort his thoughts, she figured as they sat down next to each other on her couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have a confession to make,&rdquo; James began before taking a deep breath. &ldquo;Remember the hair you gave me this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michelle nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you remember the mutated woman I mentioned yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded again, her eyes focused on his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I… uhm…&rdquo; James was stammering again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry, I mean it was just a hunch. I didn&rsquo;t mean to&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michelle brought her hand to his cheek. James tensed up as she touched him and slowly, calmly asked &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tested your hair,&rdquo; James almost sounded relieved to have said it out loud. Whispering, he added &ldquo;And it showed the same kind of mutation as that dead woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>James nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody else knows this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded again, surprised at how calmly Michelle dealt with the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are you so concerned about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I betrayed your trust. You didn&rsquo;t intend for me to test this, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually I burned to know the truth about it myself. Maybe that&rsquo;s why you even got the idea to do it. But you clearly didn&rsquo;t betray my trust as long as none of your coworkers learned about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Now since we&rsquo;re on the topic, I want to try something out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michelle guided James' face closer to hers for another kiss. As their lips met, Michelle tried to recreate the strange stream of memories that she had experienced when they had kissed for the first time. But this time, she tried to make it go the other way. Instead of her seeing James' memories, she tried to send a certain memory of her own towards him. A memory of a place somewhere in the mountains where she tried out her super strength for the first time&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; James said after the kiss. He looked at Michelle with utter amazement. &ldquo;That boulder&hellip; it was you who moved it, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michelle nodded slowly. She didn&rsquo;t know whether she should smile or even laugh. The fact that she had just telepathically sent a memory towards her boyfriend alone was reason enough to be happy, but his reaction was even better. Michelle watched intently as James processed the bit of information he had just received. Thankfully this information hadn&rsquo;t been as big a shock as it could have been - he already knew that there was something wrong with Michelle after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok,&rdquo; James eventually exclaimed. &ldquo;I think you have to explain this to me. Otherwise I&rsquo;m bound to jump to the wrong conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not exactly the kind of reaction Michelle had hoped for - but also far from what she had feared. Then again Michelle had only considered the two most extreme variants, him either being enthusiastic or freaked out. She didn&rsquo;t really like this uncertainty, so she reached out for his hand, forcing a reaction. He grabbed her hand, and her heart jumped in joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the meteor scare I found a strange seed on the sidewalk&hellip;&rdquo; she began. Michelle told the whole story, how she accidentally drank the potion that caused her initial transformation. How she tested out her new powers in the mountains - the very events that had led him to her. She also mentioned how she repeated this stunt the very next day - this time with her best friend in tow. In great detail she recalled her first heroic action - saving a small girl who shared her name from a fire. She continued with her first patrol that had followed that night, and every noteworthy event after that - including her encounter with James who eventually began to ask questions of his own, turning her one-sided narration into a lively conversation.</p>
<p>Amanda jumped up the stairs that led to her apartment as if she was hunted by death himself. She had covered the entire distance from the hospital to her place in about twenty minutes - the same time she would&rsquo;ve needed had she used a car. Even though she had no illusions that she might outrun a car on an open street, it was quite the feat for Amanda. This was one of the many improvements that Amanda&rsquo;s body had been subjected to. Still, once she had come to a stop, she realized that she had indeed pushed her body to its limit - taking a full minute until she had finally caught her breath. In her exhausted state, Amanda noticed that one thing was still missing: perspiration. Every person who had sprinted through the streets or run up the stairs like she had just done would be sweating profoundly - Amanda on the other hand had not a single drop of sweat on her body. Amanda was still ambivalent about these changes to her body, since each new revelation only reminded her of her own screw-up when she first drank the potion. She had wanted to wait until she had a better idea of any side-effects of the potion, but now she was experiencing them first-hand. At lunch, Michelle had informed her about some other side-effects that may soon manifest in herself too. Her best friend seemed to appreciate every single change that potion had done to her, no matter how inconvenient. The good news was that Amanda never had to wear glasses that could suddenly become obsolete, but being able to fly in her normal form might become troublesome. Right now the part that had interested Amanda the most had been Michelle&rsquo;s theories about mind-reading. This could actually solve Amanda&rsquo;s most pressing problem: finding out whatever Fred had been hiding from her.</p>
<p>As expected, Amanda had not been able to read Fred&rsquo;s mind when she had visited him today after work. He also hadn&rsquo;t dropped any hint at what he was hiding from her the whole time. Fortunately Amanda still had an ace in the hole with her alter ego. Once Erika had arrived, she had excused herself because she needed to work the early shift. A blatant lie considering her significantly reduced need for sleep, but it was helpful in this situation. Amanda had thus sprinted homewards, not because she wanted to test how fast her untrained body could go, but because she hoped that the critical topic might come up between Fred and Erika - and any second it took to get home counted.</p>
<p>Having caught her breath, Amanda wasted no further moment and began undressing. Her muscles still ached from the run, but Amanda ignored the pain as she knew it would stop soon. Even with all her guilt over drinking the potion too early, the idea of drinking the potion was still as thrilling as ever. Once she was naked she took out the vial with the familiar green liquid. All this power - Amanda was a bit scared to possess it again. Especially since this time there would be no Michelle to watch over her. No, Amanda had acquired a decent amount of control over these powers, all she had to do was to keep calm and nobody would get hurt. Closing her eyes, she downed the potion.</p>
<p>Immediately she could feel the effects. Amanda felt her brain working faster and faster while at the same time she felt her hair getting longer - and as she knew, redder. She even felt how her eyes shifted from their normal black color to an unnatural orange while her face rearranged itself before the rest of her body followed suit. The incredible feeling of the super energy inside her body was intoxicating. Her formerly aching muscles now emitted pure pleasure as they grew to fitness model size while her body gained a foot in height. This time Amanda even noticed the very moment her flight powers activated themselves, lifting her body off the floor. It took only a few seconds for the blonde woman to turn into a redheaded goddess, but they were very intense seconds.</p>
<p>Facing her mirror, Amanda summoned her costume. After her last training session with Michelle, she had spent the rest of her super energy testing out different variations for a real superhero costume that could replace the simple blue leotard she had used before. Her current favorite was a tank top and tight spandex-like pants - both black with red flames as highlights. Much more suitable for her red hair and the codename Devil than her incomplete Supergirl rip-off had been. It was still a work in progress, even though her progress was probably much further than Michelle&rsquo;s, who seemed convinced that a black leotard alone would suffice. Her biggest issue so far was the footwear. Amanda had considered boots but found that creating such a thick fabric used up a bit too much super energy for her liking while flat ballerinas like Michelle used simply looked ridiculous with the flame-theme. Her current compromise looked more like socks that were part of her pants - or tights for that matter. Anyway, she had a lot of time to rethink her costume before she would actually use it, but right now she had something else to do. She opened her window and took to the sky.</p>
<p>Even though the twenty minutes for her run from the hospital to her apartment had been remarkable, they paled compared to the six seconds Amanda had needed to return to the hospital. And this time she had even taken a detour, flying high up over the city before descending towards the hospital instead of a straight line. This way it was harder to determine in which direction she flew since a straight line was a bit too predictable. Now she hovered right next to Fred&rsquo;s room, watching both him and Erika with her X-Ray vision through the wall she herself hid behind. They were indeed talking, but while the wall between them was not hindrance for her eyes, Amanda couldn&rsquo;t actually hear them.</p>
<p>This is the part where super hearing would be really handy, Amanda thought. She remembered how she had discovered her heat-vision by channeling her super energy into her eyes. Right now she channeled the energy into her ears. Amanda knew that in fiction characters were normally caught off-guard by their super-hearing that turned normal background noises into a cacophony. Since she had to consciously try it, she didn&rsquo;t want to run into this trap and only increased the energy slowly. Still she could feel her plan working, all the sounds she heard became clearer, but not louder. Slowly she began to pick up more sounds. Normally these sounds were simply not loud enough to be heard, and Amanda quickly managed to separate different voices and communications that were taking place in the hospital. Amanda marveled at the possibilities that came with this. With the combined usage of her X-Ray vision and her super hearing she could supervise the whole building. It took her a few moments until she finally managed to focus on Fred and Erika&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really expect this to work out? Amanda knows that you&rsquo;re hiding something from her. It would be naïve, not to mention cruel of you to demand that she ignores this.&rdquo; That voice belonged to Erika.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have to deal with it for now.&rdquo; Fred sounded a bit grumpy. He obviously didn&rsquo;t like this topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? You cheated on her and she took you back, from where I&rsquo;m standing she deserves to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that one before.&rdquo; Fred rolled his eyes. &ldquo;And it didn&rsquo;t work out back then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a totally different situation now. And Amanda is a much stronger woman than Rachel was. She can handle it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got no idea how right you are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you even hear yourself talking? You said the exact same thing about Rachel back then. Comparing her to all my other exes and coming to the conclusion that she could handle the truth. And guess what? She couldn&rsquo;t. We broke up because of that and she even said that it would&rsquo;ve been easier if she had never known. I&rsquo;ve been down this road too many times to risk losing Amanda the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you get back together with her in the first place? After all you didn&rsquo;t seem all that interested in apologizing until that red-headed freak showed up! Did she somehow force you to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? No, it&rsquo;s not like that. First I thought that having a clean break-up would be the best for both of us. But things look a bit different, when you wake up in the hospital and instead of the woman you want at your side right now, you get the person responsible for your condition. Doing the very thing I didn&rsquo;t to Amanda: apologizing. And the funny thing is, the more I talked to her, and the better I got along with her, the more I wanted Amanda to be here. If only for a limited time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever think about what Amanda gets out of the deal? She swallows some outrageous stories about superpowered women, but you deny her the simple explanation why you cheated on the women you want at your side when things turn sour? Selfish doesn&rsquo;t even begin to describe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of that. But you know that things are a bit more complicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re scared she might dump you for something that&rsquo;s beyond your control even after tolerating you cheating on her. That&rsquo;s not complicated at all, you&rsquo;re just a wimp. And I don&rsquo;t remember my brother being a wimp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about we change the subject?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok, let&rsquo;s get a bit of fresh air, shall we?&rdquo; Erika stood up, went towards the window, and opened it. As she turned back to face Fred, she continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering why - out of all people - we encountered these women. Actually, if it was just me, I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought too much about it, considering my situation back there. But it is indeed strange that you met this red-headed freak at about the same time. Maybe they are people we know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one I met, didn&rsquo;t resemble anyone I know.&rdquo; Fred answered.</p>
<p>Liar, you mentioned the similarities between the two me&rsquo;s twice already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, same for the blonde one. But what if they can change their appearance? If they can fly and are bulletproof, this is a possibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in this case it could be anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? Don&rsquo;t you think you could narrow the identity of the redhead down a bit by concentrating on those women that were pissed you at the moment?&rdquo; Erika suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only if I want to make myself look like a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that? I mean there had to be a reason this redhead chose you to mess around with. And her behavior does fit that of a pissed-of ex-girlfriend. The question would be which of them fits better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what? I just assume that one of the suspects is her and analyze every tiny thing they do in my presence to prove my suspicions? I&rsquo;m not that paranoid.&rdquo; Fred blurted out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down, it&rsquo;s not paranoia if there&rsquo;s a valid reason to it. And if it turns out to be true, the topic will turn up sooner or later so it&rsquo;s best to be prepared for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda didn&rsquo;t like the direction the conversation was taking. Erika was on the right track here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of preparation are you talking about?&rdquo; Fred sounded curious - but a hint of surprise was audible as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mentioned that she visited you to apologize. But she also said that she will come back eventually. The question is what will happen if Amanda is here at that moment? How will she react upon seeing your girlfriend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Screw her being on the right track.</p>
<p>Fred was visibly confused now. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you implying that Amanda is the redhead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? No, Amanda can barely hold her liquor so I doubt she flies around in her spare time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good, keep thinking that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not seriously considering that Susan might be the redhead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! So it was that bitch after all! She clearly has the immature tendency for senseless destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, at least I have a name now, even though I don&rsquo;t know a Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But lacks the patience to wait for an excuse at using it. Sorry, but those two are too different character-wise to even consider that possibility. To be honest, the idea of Susan with superpowers is scary to say the least. That girl&rsquo;s got issues. I also can&rsquo;t imagine her apologizing for what she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say so. It&rsquo;s not like I met any of them in person, I only know that this spoiled brat has quite the reputation. But if you got such a good grasp at the redheads character, does that mean you couldn&rsquo;t rule out Amanda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amanda gulped hard as she heard that, but more importantly she could hear Fred&rsquo;s heart beat faster as well. Oh God, he obviously suspected me!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I said it&rsquo;s no use theorizing about it. Just because I can&rsquo;t rule her out yet doesn&rsquo;t mean that I have to assume that they are the same person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since she&rsquo;s your girlfriend, you could ask?&rdquo; Erika suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a question would only cause distrust. I expect her to trust me that my affair with Susan was not meant to harm her in any way - and you know that this is true. So I naturally trust her that if she hides something from me, she doesn&rsquo;t mean any harm for me as well. That being said, you already mentioned that she can&rsquo;t possibly be the redhead, so why even bother with this theorizing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&hellip;&rdquo; Erika tried to find the right words, but she couldn&rsquo;t find a flaw in his logic. &ldquo;Ok, I give up. You obviously put some thought into this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, this sounds suspiciously well thought-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; Michelle&rsquo;s question was more aimed at herself than the man sitting in front of her. After almost two hours of talking about her powers and what she had done with them so far, James had finally worked up the courage to ask her for a demonstration. Now that the critical moment was drawing near, she was getting nervous. For the whole day, she had secretly fantasized about how this very moment would play out. Memories of her second transformation had popped up in her head, back then she had given Amanda quite a show. But unfortunately, her transformations had happened faster each subsequent time, meaning that James would have only a short time frame to watch the changes happening. Too bad he lacked the enhanced senses Michelle had used while watching Amanda. In order to put on a great show for James she would have to somehow take control over the transformation itself. She silently cursed herself for never even attempting it. Now she had to succeed on her first try, because she really wanted to make this a memory of a lifetime for her boyfriend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; James asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit nervous about being naked right now,&rdquo; Michelle lied. &ldquo;Would you mind undressing as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>James looked surprised, maybe even a bit shocked. Clearly he had noticed her true intentions behind this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uhm, ok sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even though he seemed a bit nervous about the idea, he pulled through with it. This gave Michelle new confidence in that she would be able to make it one hell of a show. She watched James intently as he undressed as well. Michelle began to wonder what her boyfriend would look like if he had drunk the potion. Oh yeah, this had been a fantasy ever since her first transformation. To have sex with someone on her own level. As she thought about it a bit more, a weird feeling came over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re making me really nervous with this terrified expression.&rdquo; James sounded concerned now. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just thought about giving you the potion as well and I… think it&rsquo;s a really bad idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, I have no intention of taking this potion if that&rsquo;s what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had the intention of giving it to you eventually! And suddenly, from one moment to another this sounds like a grave mistake that I couldn&rsquo;t possibly want. And I have no idea why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok, calm down. Let&rsquo;s start from the beginning: Why did you want me to take it in the first place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I - uhm - wondered how it would be like to have sex with someone as super as myself.&rdquo; Michelle felt her face turning red in embarrassment. She noticed that James wasn&rsquo;t laughing - or freaked out. This calm understanding of his, turned into her anchor for not freaking out herself - despite her contradicting feelings. No, she wouldn&rsquo;t forgive herself if even a slight part of her was looking down on him in any kind of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it you would prefer it that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too embarrassed to speak it out loud, Michelle simply nodded. &ldquo;Sorry&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be. It&rsquo;s probably a side-effect of your mutation. I even have a theory: Try to imagine me drinking this potion, but from a different plant. Would this sound like a bad idea to you as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, this sounds great actually.&rdquo; Michelle even felt aroused by it. &ldquo;But why? I had no problems sharing the stuff with Amanda, why am I so picky when it comes to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the mutation that comes along with drinking it. The 56 additional chromosomes are most likely directly from the plant, meaning that everyone that drinks the potion from the same plant gains the very same 56 additional chromosomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t see the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what the problem with incest is? Due to having a very limited gene pool, the chances for genetic diseases increases drastically. Humans subconsciously avoid this by not being attracted to siblings, which may be the problem here. Because if I drank the potion, in a twisted kind of way, I&rsquo;d become your brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that mean that Amanda is my sister now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a twisted kind of way: Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is weird, but it actually makes sense. And it&rsquo;s a big relief.&rdquo; Michelle approached James, who embraced, then kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; James asked once their lips separated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feared that me suddenly being against you drinking the potion was caused by some sort of subconscious arrogance or something like that.&rdquo; Another kiss. &ldquo;Now I know that my gut feeling has a complex and valid reason behind it. It&rsquo;s good to know that my body and I are on the same page here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After everything that happened to you, you&rsquo;re concerned of becoming arrogant? Now I understand why I&rsquo;ve fallen for you this fast: You&rsquo;re just perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, this is embarrassing, you haven&rsquo;t even seen all of me yet.&rdquo; With this she broke away from him, a big smile on her face. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s about to change.&rdquo; She slowly walked over to the glass of super potion she had prepared, giving James a good view on her naked backside. She turned around and brought it to her mouth, making sure that she had his full attention.</p>
<p>Michelle let her body do the thinking right now, having found a new reason to trust her feelings. And these feelings told her that if there was a way for her to take control over the transformation process, she would find it now. As the potion entered her mouth and came in contact with her tongue, she immediately knew there was a way. Of course there was. Almost every feat she had done while in her super form had been a product of her manipulating this very energy to fulfill her wishes. She could feel it spreading through her head, supercharging her brain cells and increasing her awareness of it as it made it&rsquo;s way through her body. Michelle quickly found a way to stall the process, but her success was limited. It was like trying to hold in a sneeze, or to hold her breath for too long. Her body instinctively wanted to spread the energy through itself and activate every cell. It took Michelle all her willpower until she had found a way to slow it down - by guiding it into the body part that was to transform next.</p>
<p>As always it started with her head. She opened her eyes and saw her vision becoming better and better. The dumbfounded look on his face clearly showed that James was noticing the changes as they happened. God, those eyes … like an ocean. She now directed the energy towards her hair. Letting it grow down her back and turn blonde while at the same time her face shifted as well. And here I thought her face had been pretty before&hellip; Now the hard part began: trying to control the changes as the energy washed over her torso. Since it was futile to have one change at a time, Michelle concentrated to prevent her breast growth so that it would become the grand finale. This had more than one reason. First, James' attention would be focused on this instead of all the other changes if she were to let them happen together, second she knew that the breasts stored the excess energy, so it made sense to saturate the rest of her body first. And last, she was so aroused right now that her concentration hung by a hair&rsquo;s thread. The combination of being together with her boyfriend, feeling his affection, hearing his thoughts not to mention that the transformation process was pleasurable by itself - all these feelings begged her to cease her futile resistance and let the transformation happen as fast as possible. Unbelievable, she&rsquo;s almost as tall as I me right now&hellip; Any further stimuli might break her concentration. She even smells great&hellip; That was it, her concentration broke and so did her resistance. Immediately her transformation sped up, her muscles gaining definition, making her more imposing with her added height. Michelle moaned as her breasts surged outward, while her whole body rose off the ground. The most beautiful woman on earth hovering naked above the floor - sexiest image in history.</p>
<p>Michelle didn&rsquo;t waste any time, the moment it had finished, she acted upon the primal desire that had built up during her transformation. One might say she jumped James, but a jump would require her to touch the ground. Instead, she simply flew into him, not even bothering to slow down as their naked bodies clashed. Their lips met, he lost his balance, then they slammed into the wall. For the following minutes their minds were focused solely on their lovemaking.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, they lay next to each other in Michelle&rsquo;s bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That… was… awesome.&rdquo; James finally managed to say after a long time of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you liked it,&rdquo; Michelle answered.</p>
<p>Every muscle in my body hurts like hell, but damn this was worth it. I could get used to this kind of workout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already making training plans, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? C-can you read my mind too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was able to share my memories with you when I was in my normal form, now it&rsquo;s just ridiculously easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incredible.&rdquo; James exclaimed, his hand tracing up her arm. &ldquo;And to think that these arms were powerful enough to lift this heavy boulder in the mountains.&rdquo; I can consider myself lucky that I wasn&rsquo;t injured here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no luck involved here. I can share part of my powers upon touch, remember? You were invulnerable during our little… experiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, your powers really have a solution for everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It actually happened almost subconsciously. Like I couldn&rsquo;t stop making you invulnerable and strong as long as we were still going. Even now, only the thought that you&rsquo;re in no danger at all keeps me from doing it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really are one-of-a-kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s Amanda as well.&rdquo; Michelle&rsquo;s expression darkened as she remembered the prostitute James had mentioned before. &ldquo;And god knows how many more,&rdquo; she added whispering.</p>
<p>The mood had turned. Michelle suddenly realized that she had ignored a vital part until now. Amanda and herself weren&rsquo;t the only ones with access to this plant. There was at least one other plant out there - the dead prostitute was grim proof of that. How could she be enjoying herself while there was still such a danger out there?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault, you know.&rdquo; James suddenly exclaimed - had he read her mind here?. &ldquo;As long as we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on out there, there&rsquo;s no need to jump to conclusions. In fact, your knowledge already helps a lot here.&rdquo; For example that we&rsquo;re able to have sex without you seriously injuring me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a concern for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually more a concern of the police after they found a man that got injured during what seemed to be sex with a woman of your caliber. The big question was whether this was intentional on her part or an accident that might happen more often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means that there&rsquo;s a woman out there with powers like mine who uses them to hurt others! That&rsquo;s not a good news!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to it than just that. You see, the dead prostitute clearly had no idea how exactly she got these powers - her diary implies that she considered having them to be a hallucination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean she was somehow slipped the potion and mistook its effects for a drug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a drug addict to begin with, so maybe it was more like &lsquo;wanna try out this new stuff?&rsquo;, but we can&rsquo;t know for sure. Actually she could&rsquo;ve gotten the powers by accident, similar to how you accidentally drank the potion in the first place. Either way the fact that she had no idea might apply to the whoever had sex with that man. In this case she would be powerless without any idea how to get the powers back, meaning that she&rsquo;d be essentially harmless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or she could be the one who gave the potion to the prostitute and used it on herself after the successful experiment,&rdquo; Michelle retorted. &ldquo;Only when we find her, will we know for sure. And this means I&rsquo;ll have to patrol tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feared you would say that. This is the downside for dating a superheroine, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michelle&rsquo;s face turned red. &ldquo;I may be super, but I&rsquo;m far from being a heroine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re just going on patrol with the intention of stopping whatever crime you come across - bringing yourself into danger as a result from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that I&rsquo;m pretty much invulnerable right now, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well your powers can run out, so I&rsquo;d be a lot more at ease if you took a bit more of that potion to make sure you could handle any super-powered person you might come across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michelle kissed him as a sign that she appreciated his concern. Through this kiss, she could clearly sense that his concern was even bigger than he let on. The very possibility that she might get in danger already caused some kind of protective instinct to emerge, it seemed. Michelle also noticed that he was tired, obviously their lovemaking had really worn him out. By the time their kiss ended, James had already fallen asleep. As Michelle slowly hovered out of her bed, she decided to take him by his word and drink a few extra doses before heading out on her nightly patrol.</p>
