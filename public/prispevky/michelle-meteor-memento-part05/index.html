            <p>“I can’t believe you actually took it!”</p>
<p>Michelle’s first reaction to seeing her best friend Amanda with  the body of a goddess hovering through her apartment window was  different than either of them had expected it to be.</p>
<p>One of the reasons  she reacted this way was that Amanda had not only declined the  mysterious super power granting potion just yesterday, saying she wanted  to see the long-term effects of taking the potion. Another reason was  that she had secretly wanted to see Amanda’s first transformation  first-hand. The red-headed goddess standing in front of Michelle was the  result of this transformation. Michelle herself was in her normal form  right now as she didn’t intend to transform before nightfall.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe I’m already regretting drinking it,” Amanda answered sadly. “I just ruined my ex-boyfriend’s life.”</p>
<p>Amanda started to tell her friend about the events that led up  to her transformation. She had been feeling sick for the whole day and  to top it off, Fred had come to get his stuff out of her apartment.  After that, Amanda had drunk the strange liquid to transform from the  bleached blonde waitress she had been to the red-headed amazon she was  now. Amanda went into great detail about how she encountered Fred again  and how she just wanted to mess with him a little. When Fred wasn’t as  awestruck and friendly as Amanda had expected, she had begun to trash  his car – just to teach him a lesson of course. Fred hat been really  pissed about the car so Amanda tried to fly around carrying him and  accidentally let him fall…</p>
<p>“…and the landing ruined his left knee. I checked it with my  X-Ray vision, and trust me, he’ll have to recover from this for a really  long time – IF he recovers at all that is,” Amanda concluded while  tears were running down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Michelle didn’t know what to say about that. It was only  natural for Amanda to feel guilty as her powers had caused more harm  than she had intended. Still, Michelle was eager to know what exactly  Amanda had intended.</p>
<p>“Why did you confront Fred after your transformation? What kind of lesson did you want to teach him?”</p>
<p>Amanda didn’t answer right away. Slowly she brushed away her tears as she formulated her answer.</p>
<p>“It just kinda happened. I hovered over the city wondering how  to test out these powers, and then I spotted him. So I decided to show  him this killer body and see how he reacts. I figured that with this look…” Amanda pointed at herself “…he would either try to hit on me or be too intimidated to even try.”</p>
<p>“But that’s not what happened.”</p>
<p>“At first he did seem to be intimidated, but that didn’t last  long. When I teased him, he only became annoyed as if I were just  another girl.”</p>
<p>“Of course he did. He couldn’t know that it was you, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know… encountering the ex-boyfriend right after  acquiring super powers could only end in disaster. Drinking the potion  itself was a mistake. If I only had stuck to my original plan to  wait&hellip;”</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t insisted on giving you some of the potion, you  wouldn’t have been tempted. I knew about your breakup, but I didn’t  consider it when I gave you those vials. So this is my fault as well.”</p>
<p>“Don’t try to take the blame from me. I shouldn’t have drunk  the potion but that’s what I did. And instead of helping other people  like you, I ended up crippling someone close to me. This stuff has  brought out the worst of me!”</p>
<p>“No!” Michelle said this more eagerly than she intended to.  “You may have hurt him with your powers, but you’re feeling bad about it  while still being super. That just shows that this stuff doesn’t cloud  your judgment. You were emotionally vulnerable due to your breakup.  Damn! You even slapped him before your transformation. So don’t make it sound like it was the potion that made you do it!”</p>
<p>Surprise was written all over Amanda’s face about Michelle’s  sudden outburst. But it didn’t take long for her to find the reason  behind it. If the potion really had an effect on her personality, it  would mean that Michelle would not only have been affected as well, but  actually more so than Amanda who just took it once.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean it that way. It’s just that when I saw you  saving that child yesterday, I didn’t see the woman that had just spent  an hour in the woods trying and failing to get to know her own  superpowers, but a real-life superheroine. Someone, that actually deserves the powers she possesses. This whole mess just shows that I am not worthy of these powers.”</p>
<p>“…yet,” Michelle added. “Right now you carry some emotional  baggage, but when this whole Fred thing is sorted out, I’m sure you will  live up to your expectations. To be honest, right now I am more  operating on luck than anything else. I downright panicked in that  burning house and last night, I almost got somebody killed because of my  recklessness.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“Well I prevented a rape and one of the thugs shot me right in  my breast which felt so good that I gave him an opportunity to shoot the  woman I tried to save from them. Luckily he shot me a second time  instead. So you see I am just as inexperienced with this as you are, and  I have a lot to learn if I want to become a superheroine.”</p>
<p>“I see, even you have your problems with these powers. But right now, I’m still super, so I’ll have to make it worth it.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean with this?”</p>
<p>“You said it yourself: I have to get over this whole situation  with Fred. So the best course of action would be to fly over and  apologize to him before my transformation runs out.”</p>
<p>Amanda started to float off the couch and towards the open  window of Michelle’s apartment. Right before the window she came to a  stop. Amanda faced to the window, so Michelle only saw her from behind.  From this perspective Amanda seemed much more secure than she had during  their conversation. The fact that her bare feet hovered a few inches  above the floor helped as well. Even for Michelle, who had flown under  her own powers several times during the last 48 hours, the sight of her  best friend hovering majestically in the air was as impressive as it was  unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Could it be that you have something on your heart as well?”</p>
<p>Michelle hesitated a bit before giving her answer. Memories of  her strange dream last night as well as her encounter with James flashed  through her head.</p>
<p>“It can wait. I’ll just come over later.”</p>
<p>“Ok, I’ll keep a window open for you.”</p>
<p>With this she left through the window before ascending so fast  that Michelle had trouble keeping track of her. While it was a rather  sudden exit, it also guaranteed that nobody besides Michelle had  actually seen the red-headed goddess leaving her apartment.</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry to have called you here on a Sunday afternoon  Mr. Thompson, but this case really falls into your jurisdiction,” said  Dr. Peter Philips.</p>
<p>The forensic doctor barely hid his own excitement as he led James to his lab.</p>
<p>“Detective Spencer mentioned that you were already familiar with this case.”</p>
<p>“He mentioned a drug addict dying from an overdose that  wouldn’t be lethal considering her history. So he suspected her to be  another woman posing as her. I don’t really see where I fit into this.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, we suspected that there were two different women  involved; one drug addict and another similar looking woman with no drug  history that died trying to pose as her. That’s why we ran a DNA test  with hair we found in her apartment.”</p>
<p>“And? Do they match?”</p>
<p>“Here is where it gets tricky. The standard tests have been  100% positive claiming that their DNA is indeed identical. But a simple  look through the microscope showed that they were anything but.”</p>
<p>They entered the lab. A woman’s corpse was lying there. Obviously it was the woman in question.</p>
<p>“The original hair we found in the apartment contained DNA with  46 chromosomes, the standard for a human. But this mysterious beauty  here has a DNA with 100 chromosomes, including the 46 that are identical  to the ones found on the old hair.”</p>
<p>James took a closer look at this woman. She was indeed pretty.  While she wasn’t the most beautiful girl in town, there was something  about her that seemed familiar to James. He just didn’t know what that  was.</p>
<p>“100 chromosomes you say? That would mean this person isn’t even a human being.”</p>
<p>“Well 46% of her are still human, as for the rest, I have no idea.”</p>
<p>“What the hell changes her DNA so much?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got no idea, but it sure worked wonders for her looks.  The pictures we found of her showed her more fitting the image of a  crack whore. This woman could easily pass as the nice girl next door.”</p>
<p>“It may have been good for her looks, but not for her health.”</p>
<p>“I’m not too sure about that. I think whatever happened to her  brought her to peak health; which includes a reset of her drug-history.  If her body’s addiction was cured as well, her death would be the result  of her own stupidity.”</p>
<p>“There’s only one way to find out. Prepare to transport her to  our facility; my colleagues and I will take care of her case from here.”</p>
<p>James gritted his teeth as he said that. This would mean his  superiors would learn about this case, and most likely they would keep  him out of the loop.</p>
<p>The warm afternoon sun had turned the hospital room into a  makeshift sauna. While it brought some fresh air into his room, Fred  soon regretted asking the nurse to open the windows wide enough for him.  This was definitely the worst weekend of his entire life. First his  girlfriend found out about his affair, causing two breakups at the price  of one which pretty much ended all the dreams and hopes he had. Then  just when he had gotten his stuff from his now-ex-girlfriend Amanda,  this strange redhead had appeared out of nowhere with the sole goal of  making his life miserable.</p>
<p>Her flaming orange eyes should have been his first hint that  this woman was trouble, but Fred didn&rsquo;t realize this until after she had  trashed his car with nothing but her bare feet – without any regret  whatsoever. When he had seen her hovering over the ground, he had  attempted to flee, resulting in her picking him up and dropping him from  at least ten feet in the air. Fred wondered whether this redhead had  actually intended to let him fall. She had looked rather horrified as  his leg had given away under him, and sure enough he had been  hospitalized because of this.</p>
<p>Fred lost his consciousness shortly after this, and he was  surprised when he woke up in the hospital. But his misery wasn’t  complete until the doctor told him that he would be bedridden for quite  some time and that his knee would most likely never recover. Right now  he was more concerned about being bedridden, as he still had things to  do. And time was now running out on him.</p>
<p>“Oh no, not you again!” Fred blurted out, when he saw the  weightless redhead entering his room through the window. She was still  dressed in a blue leotard and nothing more. The woman’s beauty was just  as supernatural as her strength or her ability to fly.</p>
<p>“What a warming welcome,” said the redhead as she gracefully landed on the floor. “But I guess I kind of deserve it.”</p>
<p>She didn’t look as confident as she had back when they first  met. To Fred, it seemed like she indeed regretted what had happened.</p>
<p>“What do you want here?” Fred asked coldly.</p>
<p>The redhead stopped in her tracks, seemingly intimidated by his cold welcome.</p>
<p>“I… came to see how your leg is doing,” she said avoiding his gaze.</p>
<p>“It is fine, I’ll be running around as if nothing happened in a  day or two,” he said sarcastically before adding, “Now leave me alone!”</p>
<p>The woman took a look at his knee. “You’re lying.”</p>
<p>“No, I really want you to leave!”</p>
<p>“I’m talking about your leg. Will it recover?”</p>
<p>“That’s none of your business.”</p>
<p>“Of course it is,” she said, now looking at him again. “I’m the reason you’re…”</p>
<p>“…crippled. Damn straight you are,” Fred interrupted, meeting  her flaming eyes with a cold stare. He watched as the gorgeous redheads  eyes filled with tears. She didn’t start to cry, though, and Fred was  glad about that. Making her cry wouldn’t help his situation at all.</p>
<p>“Oh I’m so sorry; I really didn’t mean to hurt you.”</p>
<p>“Right, you only had my best intentions in mind when you came  over to – how did you put it? – mess with me! How about you stop messing  around and finally get out of here?”</p>
<p>“You’re really cruel. I am here to apologize and all you do is shoving me away.”</p>
<p>There was a hint of annoyance in her voice, and Fred actually  welcomed it. Watching such a beautiful face with this pitiful expression  made it hard for him to be angry at her.</p>
<p>“What did you expect? You ruined my life in a matter of minutes and now you expect me to forgive you? How naïve can you get?”</p>
<p>“Ruined your life? Aren’t you exaggerating a little too much?  I’ve got X-Ray vision, so I see that your knee will take time to  recover. But even if it never fully recovers, you’ll be able to walk on  your own. So please do me a favor and don’t act as if you were  paralyzed.”</p>
<p>For some reason, the tears in her eyes had disappeared – giving  her a much more confident expression. Something about her seemed  familiar, but Fred couldn’t put his finger on it.</p>
<p>“Ok, I admit it. You alone didn’t ruin my life; you were just the final nail in the coffin.”</p>
<p>The redhead seemed to be satisfied with this and Fred was happy  that she didn’t ask for a further explanation. She then moved closer to  him and put her hand on his wounded knee. For a second the pain in his  leg seemed to disappear, but when she let go of his knee it returned  with full force.</p>
<p>“What the hell did you do there?”</p>
<p>“I tested whether or not my powers include healing other  people,” she answered disappointedly. “But unfortunately this doesn’t  seem to be the case. I shared my invulnerability with you just now, but  it also stalled the healing process. It seems like I can’t use my powers  to make you feel more comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Healing others? Yeah this would have solved most of my  problems,” Fred admitted. He was actually beginning to feel comfortable  around her. “Speaking of your powers… what exactly are you?”</p>
<p>“A young superhot superwoman,” she answered, sticking out her tongue.</p>
<p>“I see that. And you don’t even know what you can do.”</p>
<p>“That was kinda obvious wasn’t it?” she sounded a bit embarrassed. “But I’m learning fast.”</p>
<p>“Would you at least tell me your name?”</p>
<p>“I told you before, it’s a secret.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I have to call you somehow don’t I?”</p>
<p>“Then think about a name. I could always use some inspiration for a good superhero name.”</p>
<p>A superhero name? Fred recalled a conversation with Amanda  where she had asked him to think about a superhero name for her. Back  then it was rather silly, but this woman here did possess super powers which she still showcased by hovering a few feet above the floor. Come to think of it…</p>
<p>“How about Devil?”</p>
<p>“What?” The redhead glared at him with a strange mix of fury,  confusion and embarrassment. “Why this name? I mean… do I really look  that… um, evil to you?” While she said that, she slowly rose higher and  higher until she <em>bump</em> hit the ceiling.</p>
<p>Fred chuckled for the first time since he encountered this  woman. He had intended to tease her, but her reaction was more intense  than Amanda’s had been.</p>
<p>“I probably should explain that. I used this nickname for someone else before, and you reminded me of her.”</p>
<p>She remained silent for a short while. Her head still hovered directly below the ceiling.</p>
<p>“So I take it you didn’t exactly like ‘her’, either,” she concluded as she started to descend.</p>
<p>“On the contrary, I actually love her,” Fred was surprised at his own honesty.</p>
<p><em>bump</em> The redhead had hit the ceiling faster this time, and  small cracks in the ceiling were visible. If she kept this up, the next  bump might be her going through the roof.</p>
<p>“First you want to get me to leave, now you compare me to the  woman you love.” She started to shake some debris out of her red mane.  Any other woman would have been more concerned about a concussion right  now. “You’re not making any sense.”</p>
<p>She had a point. Why did he even mention Amanda here? To a complete stranger?</p>
<p>“She broke up with me and hates my guts&hellip; as I said; you were just the final nail in the coffin.”</p>
<p>“Why exactly did she break up with you?” ‘Devil’ asked cautiously, as she descended once again.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say it was my own fault,” Fred sighed.</p>
<p>“So you did something she couldn’t forgive?” she dug further.</p>
<p>“Obviously. I don’t want to talk about it.”</p>
<p>She curled her lips into a disapproving frown; obviously she  would have like to know more about his breakup. But Fred had no  intention of telling her things, that he hadn’t even told Amanda.</p>
<p>“Speaking of forgiveness,” she said. “Is there anything I can do to make up for your trouble?”</p>
<p>Was she still going on about that?</p>
<p>“It’s pretty clear that you didn’t intend to hurt me. So there isn’t really anything I could ask of you.”</p>
<p>“How about compensation for your car?”</p>
<p>“That would be nice, but I doubt you have the insurance to  cover it.” Fred thought about it for a moment before adding. “Actually,  if you do have some money to spare you might as well buy the car  itself.”</p>
<p>“What?” she was surprised but at least she didn’t bump into the  ceiling this time. “You love this car… I mean you already got angry at  me for simply standing on its roof.”</p>
<p>“Because I already intended to sell it,” he explained. “Anyway, you don’t need to buy it if you don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“I’ll think about it,” she said, before starting to turn  around. “I should leave now.” She floated towards the window before  turning to him one last time. “It may be a while before we meet again.”</p>
<p>Fred simply nodded, then added “See you.”</p>
<p>“Bye.” And in the blink of an eye, she was gone.</p>
<p>Amanda soared through the air, gaining altitude at an  incredibly fast rate. She came to a stop high above the city to sort out  her thoughts. Pretending to be a totally different woman was much  harder than she had expected. It was made even worse by the fact that  she was both guilty for hospitalizing him in the first place and pissed  off at him for cheating on her. She actually thought that she had done a  good job, but Fred already saw some similarities between the two hers.  He had actually given her the same nickname he had given her before. At  least he hadn’t told ‘Devil’ that this nickname had originally been  restricted to their bedroom. But what really bugged her was that he had  nonchalantly said that he still loved her. Why had he said that? Why had  it felt so good to hear that, that she had lost the control of her  flight powers?</p>
<p>And he intended to sell his car? Even before their breakup, she  had been pissed more than once because she thought he’d like his car  more than her. What the hell had gotten into him?</p>
<p>Allowing herself into a free fall, Amanda began her trip back  to her apartment. It took only two minutes for her to arrive there, but  she enjoyed them. The freedom of flying made her forget the conflicting  feelings she had.</p>
<p>Back in her apartment, she stayed hovering in midair and waited  for her powers to fade. A short moment of weakness had turned her world  upside down. By drinking the potion she had gained a taste of power,  power that could easily be used to hurt and destroy – as she had proven  with Fred and his car. But also power that could help other people.</p>
<p>The only thing that disappointed her about her powers was the  fact that while she could share her powers to make others invulnerable  and thus painless, she wasn’t able to heal other people. Trying out to  heal the wound she had caused remembered Amanda of her failed attempt to  become a doctor. While she wasn’t stupid, Amanda just wasn’t able to  focus on learning long enough to stand a chance in college.  She may  have picked up a thing or two, but in the end she had to drop out and  was stuck as a waitress ever since. Being able to heal others, well that  would have been too good a superpower to be true. Right now she would  have traded all of her other powers for that. Maybe this was her guilt  speaking, maybe it was the fact that her powers were already running out  at this very moment.</p>
<p>The first outward sign of her transformation was her self-made  leotard dissolving into thin air, exposing her super body to the world  one last time. Next, she couldn’t use her flight powers anymore and  landed on the floor. She then shrunk down back to 5’3” while her muscles  lost their definition and her breasts shrank down to their original  size. When she had seen Michelle transform back to normal yesterday, she  had been almost as thrilled as she had been watching her best friend  becoming super. But now she was … underwhelmed. While her earlier  transformation had started painful and ended being really pleasurable,  this transformation just felt normal. Sure, she was now powerless but it  didn’t feel as bad as she had expected. Then again she had spent her  entire life without super powers, so it was only natural that a few  hours wouldn’t make her feel otherwise.</p>
<p>Amanda then remembered that she had been able to spot  differences in Michelle’s appearance after her first transformation, so  she went to her mirror to see how she had changed.</p>
<p>“Holy crap!”</p>
<p>Amanda had indeed slimmed down a little and she was also sure  that her face had become prettier – if only a little. The real  difference was her hair. Where before she had sported bleached blonde  hair, Amanda now had golden blonde hair similar to Michelle’s hair in  her super form. But Amanda’s original hair color was brown – just like  Michelle’s was. For some reason, Amanda’s natural hair color had  changed. She was still wondering why this had happened as she heard her  phone ring.</p>
<p>The day had been quite eventful for Michelle until now, given  her encounter with James and Amanda’s dropping by earlier. The brunette  had tried to get some rest by lounging on the couch and watching TV, but  soon grew bored of it and preferred to do something more useful. To  Michelle it seemed like her body didn’t really need much rest – just  like she only needed two hours of sleep last night. So far any effect of  the potion had been benevolent. Then there was the strange dream she  had last night. This alter ego that had appeared to her seemed to have a  deeper meaning, but that made it all the more mysterious. Michelle had  kept this dream a secret from Amanda, but she soon had to tell her  friend about it. The best way of telling whether this was caused by the  potion was by seeing whether or not something similar would happen to  Amanda. Well, she had agreed to meet her later, so it would be for the  best to tell her then.</p>
<p>Right now Michelle was sitting in front of the mysterious plant  that had turned her life upside down. Having brought it to her living  room, Michelle took a good look at it. There were ten buds in total;  five of them were full with the super potion, while the other five were  in various stages of refilling. So far she had transformed thrice until  now, while Amanda had taken another three doses with her – at leastone  of which she had already used. This meant the bud that had contained the  potion for her very first transformation was full again. Michelle  didn’t really know how much potion she had drunk that first time –most  likely the whole contents of a bud – so she was pretty sure that it  would take about two days for a bud to refill.</p>
<p>Michelle only possessed three vials that she could fill with  the potion – and she had given them to Amanda. This wasn’t really a  problem, though. While it was true that a vial could be carried around  easily to transform when necessary, it could just as easily get lost or  stolen. If anybody saw her stripping down, then drinking the potion and  transforming into her super self, this person would sure as hell try to  get their hand onto the potion as well. Or worse, film her and  put it online. Trying to transform while on the job would be even more  dangerous, considering she worked at a TV station. For the time being  Michelle thought it would be the best idea to transform only in the  confinements of her own apartment – and maybe Amanda’s. This way she  really wouldn’t let her superhero life interfere with her normal life.</p>
<p>Carefully the young woman started to milk the five buds into a  bottle. Together, it was about half a liter – making each filled bud  contain roughly 100ml. It was funny how a supposedly alien plant seemed  to adhere to the metric system, but it made things easier to her.  Michelle also milked the buds that weren’t completely full yet in order  to find out how long the plant would need to regenerate. In total she  had about 800ml – or eight doses – of the potion. Two days for complete  regeneration still seemed like a good guess. This meant she could use up  to five doses a day. As long as there weren’t any complications with  drinking too much of the potion, this meant she could be super permanently.  While it was indeed a tempting thought, Michelle scrapped the idea  almost immediately. She may not have been totally happy about her life  recently, but there were still several things she cherished. The young  brunette preferred to think of her time as a super powered goddess as an  addition to her life, not a replacement.</p>
<p>Now that she was done milking the plant, Michelle carefully put  it back on her nightstand. When she went to put the bottle with the  super potion into her fridge, she thought about Amanda and her first  transformation. Michelle was a bit disappointed that she hadn’t seen the  spectacle first hand, but that wasn’t only because she wanted to see  her best friend transforming. She also wanted to see how exactly this  first transformation took place and how it differed from the following  ones – by watching the whole ordeal with the improved eyes of her own  super form. Well, this opportunity was lost, but if she really insisted  on seeing a first transformation, she just needed to give somebody else a  dose of the potion – somehow her curiosity about the first  transformation dropped at this thought.</p>
<p>Taking another look at the bottle with the super potion, she  started to wonder whether there existed an upper limit of how much of  the potion could be drunk. If she drank a double dose, would she  transform into an even bigger, bustier and stronger superwoman or would  she just have twice the amount of super energy at her disposal? Probably  the latter, but there was only one way to find out. Michelle had  intended to wait until evening to transform, but it seemed pretty  pointless now. She had already exposed her powers before, and now Amanda  had been flying around in broad daylight as well. Michelle quickly  filled a glass with a double dose of the strange green liquid before  stuffing the bottle into the fridge. Then she returned to her bedroom to  undress herself. Standing once again in front of her mirror to see her  ‘normal’ body, she downed the green potion.</p>
<p>After having transformed three times already, Michelle had  grown accustomed to the sensations of her transformation. By the time  she finished drinking, her mind had already been supercharged, and  Michelle knew that her face was now stunningly beautiful with blue eyes  instead of her near-sighted brown ones, while her hair was now a long  golden mane. Then her whole body joined in the transformation, and she  quickly transmuted from the skinny 5’3” woman to the athletic 6’3”  goddess whose naked form became weightless as her transformation was  completed. Michelle smiled at this fact; somehow the urge to fly was a  part of her transformation, and she had only suppressedit once so far.  Michelle’s theory seemed to be correct. She could feel that she now  possessed at least twice as much super energy as she did during her last  two transformations. It wasn’t that she was now stronger or faster, but  Michelle had twice the energy supply at her disposal now.</p>
<p>She conjured her costume, a black leotard and matching black  ballerinas and checked her look in her mirror. She could actually try to  add new things to her costume, but decided against it. The only thing  that was really missing would be a symbol that could be associated with  her. This on the other hand required a superhero name - which Michelle  lacked as well.</p>
<p>“A superhero name,” Michelle thought aloud. She wanted to  become a superhero to help people, and she didn’t really need a name for  her super self. Still, she had to admit that she would need some name  to identify herself with. And if she didn’t choose one, the media would.  Too bad her powers didn’t come with an animal motif. Names like  Plantgirl or Potionwoman were a no-go as well, since they only revealed  the source of her powers. And other names like Power Princess or  Superwoman only sounded silly and arrogant to her, especially when she  imagined introducing herself as such. It might work if other  people called her this, though. This way it would be more of a title  than a self-chosen name. For now, Michelle decided to wait and see what  the media would call her. She didn’t really want to draw any unnecessary  attention, though. Her super powers still had a surprise effect, and  she intended to use it as long as she could.</p>
<p>Michelle left the confinements of her apartment and took to the  sky. Hovering high above the skyline, the blonde goddess reveled in the  feeling of superiority that came from being above the city. Like the  night before, Michelle watched the streets from high above, waiting for a  situation that required her help.</p>
<p>After ten minutes of searching, it became clear to her. There  wouldn’t be a crisis that required a superhero to step in just because  she wanted to. Being a superhero would require patience; this much,  Michelle could already tell. She began flying circles around town while  she kept looking for someone who might need her help. Half an hour  later, Michelle heard the sound of sirens and found herself happy for  it&hellip; At least for a second before she realized that the sirens  definitely meant something bad was happening, and that she shouldn’t be  glad even though she had spent the whole time waiting for it.</p>
<p>Looking for the source of the sound, Michelle discovered a  police car in pursuit of another car. Using her X-Ray vision, Michelle  spotted four people inside the fleeing car – three men and a woman. One  man was driving, one on the front seat, while the last man and the woman  sat in the back seats. All three men wore black leather jackets and  matching black cold weather masks. With her dress it was clear that the  woman didn’t belong to these two. Michelle wasn’t really surprised to  see that the man next to the woman pointed a gun at her. This confirmed  that she was indeed the hostage in this situation.</p>
<p>Compared to the attempted raping yesterday, these were  professionals. Michelle had to consider her options carefully. Her  primary concern was to get the hostage to safety.  Attacking them while  they were still driving would only endanger the hostage and the traffic  around them as well. This meant she would have to wait until the men  left the car. She still had the element of surprise on her side, so she  followed the car – flying directly above it. There was no reason for  them to look up, as they were more concerned about the police behind  them. As for the police, they were too focused on the getaway car to  spot the blonde superwoman.</p>
<p>Minutes passed while the cars blazed through the streets. While  the police car struggled to pursue the fleeing car, this proved  absolutely no problem for the airborne woman above them. Eventually the  criminals succeeded in losing the police car as they drove a red light  just before the upcoming traffic made it impossible for the police to  follow. Michelle wondered why there wasn’t at least a second car as  reinforcements. Then again a part of her was happy, that this – from her  perspective – boring chase was over and she could step (or better fly)  into action soon. She couldn’t help but feel excited.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the car drove into a parking block.  Michelle had to use her X-Ray vision not to lose them while she herself  stayed out of their sight. She could feel her heart begin to beat faster  as the car stopped and the critical moment for Michelle would arrive.  She watched as the men said something to the woman before leaving the  car without her. Michelle couldn’t believe her luck. Now that they considered themselves safe, the three men abandoned the now useless hostage.</p>
<p>The men walked away from their original car towards another car  that – so Michelle thought – was most likely their next escape vessel.  The blonde superwoman didn’t intend to let them reach this car. Having  watched everything with her X-Ray vision, she easily flew into their  direction from their blind spot. Thanks to her flying ability, her  approach was totally silent. The closer she got to them, the faster and  more forceful her heart beat. If it wasn’t for her excitement, she would  have wondered if it was audible from the outside. It wasn’t. Unnoticed,  she attacked the first criminal, the one who walked behind his partners.</p>
<p>The man had no chance to realize what was happening to him.  Suddenly Michelle’s leg appeared in front of him and before he could  react, he had already tripped over it. In the split second before  falling over, he could feel something – Michelle’s hands – pushing him  towards the ground. The force of the impact instantly knocked him out.  With a single glimpse of her X-Ray vision the blonde superwoman verified  that the man only sported minor injuries before turning to his comrades.</p>
<p>Michelle had to admit that the two remaining men reacted faster  and more organized than she had expected them to. Both of them had  already pointed their guns at her and fired several times. The two men  were understandably surprised to see their bullets bounce off her body  without doing any damage at all – neither to her nor to her clothes.  Michelle reveled in the pleasant sensation that coursed through her body  as two of the six bullets hit her breasts. Unlike last time, she was  prepared for these sensations, and she didn’t give any outward sign of  being affected at all by the normally fatal projectiles. Throwing his  gun away, the bigger one decided to punch her. Michelle didn’t even  bother to dodge. She knew that he wouldn’t be able to hurt her, even if his fist hit her right on her nose.</p>
<p>There was just one thing she hadn’t accounted for: their weight  difference. With her 6’3”, Michelle was rather tall for a woman, but  her enemy stood a little taller than her and was rather bulky. So when  he hit her with full force the impact caused her to fall backwards. The  man cursed, holding his hand that had clearly paid the price for trying  to break an indestructible nose. Her pride on the other hand was a  little dented. Michelle used the time to get back on her feet. She  wouldn’t make the mistake of getting caught off-guard again. When the  thug tried to hit her once again with his other hand, she grabbed it and  squeezed it until she heard the bones inside break. The man screamed in  agony, but a punch into the stomach ended this fight and his  consciousness.</p>
<p>“Stop it right there!”</p>
<p>Michelle heard the last thug shout from behind her. As she  turned around she saw that he was standing next to their original car,  holding the hostage at gunpoint. He must have run there while Michelle  was distracted with his partner.</p>
<p>Michelle watched them in utter horror. Any feeling of  superiority that had built up during the situation was now gone. She had  been careless. Once again this carelessness risked the life of the  person she had intended to protect. Why hadn’t she played it safe and  dealt with the hostage before beating up the bad guys? It was no use  trying to think about her mistakes now. She had to calmly analyze the  situation and find a way to save the hostage. Since super speed wasn’t  exactly her strong suit, catching the bullet was no option. The man  should be nervous as well. After all, he had just seen bullets bouncing  of her chest and his comrades getting knocked out quite easily. Michelle  forced herself to look as confident as possible. She still had some  aces in the hole, so while she tried to find the right one, she needed  to distract his from her actual fear. Slowly, she took a step forward.</p>
<p>“One more step and I’ll blow her brains out!”</p>
<p>“And then what?” Michelle crossed her arms, trying to look as  imposing as possible. “What do you think will happen after you killed  your hostage? Right now she’s your lifeline. If she dies, so will you –  this much I can guarantee!”</p>
<p>Michelle’s gained confidence as plans formed in her head. This  guy had no idea what she was capable of, no idea that the costume she  was wearing was actually part of her body and looked the way it did  because she wanted it to, no idea that she could share her powers  through skin contact, no idea that she could fly, see through walls and  he had no idea how strong she actually was.</p>
<p>“Y-you’re bluffing,” stammered the man. “You want to save her, don’t you?”</p>
<p>If plan B worked, the woman was already safe, but Michelle didn’t dare to find out without trying plan A.</p>
<p>“Of course, but here’s the problem: If you kill her, that means  I failed and I’ll really be pissed at you. And in case you didn’t get  it, there’s nothing capable of stopping me from picking you up and  flying with you to the Sahara desert where I’d abandon you.”</p>
<p>“F-Fly?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, you didn’t see this one yet,” Michelle said as she  became airborne and subsequently much more intimidating. Both the man  and his hostage gasped in surprise. Michelle took her chance and slowly  floated closer to them, just slow enough so that the man didn’t realize  it.</p>
<p>“So you actually have only two choices. You either drop your  gun, let her go and get arrested by the police which will lead to a fair  trial, or you pull the trigger and fall under my jurisdiction, which  means so much torture that you will wish for death. It’s your choice.”</p>
<p>Even with the mask it was clear that the man was utterly  terrified of Michelle’s display of power. After a short while he dropped  the gun and let go of the woman.</p>
<p>“You win.”</p>
<p>Michelle didn’t waste any time and knocked him out as soon as  the woman was away from him. Only when he lay on the floor unconscious,  Michelle allowed herself to sigh in relief.</p>
<p>“Phew he actually fell for my bluff,” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I’m really grateful for you rescuing me, but what part of it  was a bluff?” asked the now free woman. Now that she looked at her,  Michelle was sure she had seen this woman before, but she couldn’t put her finger on it.</p>
<p>“I doubt I could have tortured and killed him. While I’m physically capable of doing that, I don’t want to harm – not to mention  kill - anybody unless it&rsquo;s necessary. And maybe not even then.”</p>
<p>“So the only thing that saved me was that he didn’t know that? I doubt that this tactic will work forever.”</p>
<p>“Actually I had a plan B, but let’s just be happy that it didn’t come to it.”</p>
<p>The sound of sirens filled the air, signaling that the police  had finally figured out their whereabouts. The woman looked outside to  beckon the police cars towards them.</p>
<p>“By the way, what’s your name?” she asked as she turned around, only to find that she was alone.</p>
<p>High above the parking block, Michelle wasn’t too proud of  herself, as she had almost screwed up again. What’s more she had no idea  whether her plan B would have worked to begin with. Her X-Ray vision  was quite helpful when it came to silently watching how the police made  its way to the crime scene – by ignoring the layers of concrete and  steel as well as the wires and security cameras between her and the  scene.</p>
