<p>Sudhish Basra glanced back over his shoulder, checking the progress of the approaching storm front from the east. He sighed. His long walk away from the lagoon, a chance for him to sort out all the feelings that erupted after his second feeding, was going to be interrupted by the storm. He couldn&rsquo;t tell how far away it was&ndash;the gray-green ocean being a useless reference point&ndash;but he guessed it would be here before he could make it back to the lagoon. Maybe he should just cut back across through the jungle? No, he didn&rsquo;t really know the island very well and the beach wasn&rsquo;t going to get him lost.</p>
<p>The sound of distant thunder echoed, confirming the storm&rsquo;s size.</p>
<p>Well, if lightning struck him while he was walking back, it would solve some of his problems, he thought. He stopped, looking at the clear sky above his head. Who or what was up there? Why in Krishna&rsquo;s name had all this happened to him and his family! Why?</p>
<p>Nothing. Just silence. Well, not really silence; there were the birds in the jungle, the wind in the palms, and the waves rolling onto the sand.</p>
<p>And another peal of thunder.</p>
<p>He shook his fists at the heavens.</p>
<p>He loved his sisters, of course he did! But why, oh gods, why did he now feel so guilty about it? This morning, after their second feeding, he started to fantasize about having sex with his sister, Rani. He was appalled! Thankfully, his own shame and his shorts had prevented anyone from noticing his arousal before he regained control. Gods! Rani was beautiful! So was Vidya, but it was Rani&rsquo;s large, soft breasts that caught him by surprise this morning.</p>
<p>Overnight the first feeding of mermaid milk had worked its magic, or that&rsquo;s what it looked like to Sudhish. Rani and Vidya were bursting with health, and since they were already in their early twenties, little else had changed. Well, that wasn&rsquo;t entirely true; both had become more shapely, especially up top, and both had decided to remain topless, since none of the mermaids wore anything. The sight of his sisters, topless, healthy, happy, and laughing should have brought him joy, but instead, it was agony.</p>
<p>The queasy feeling rolled through him, and he wondered if he would throw up. He sank to the sand, breathing deeply, trying to make the feeling go away. His own sisters! He watched them this morning as they kissed each other in a most unsisterly way! He had been entranced and repulsed. What was happening to him, to his sisters? This was taboo!</p>
<p>He crossed his legs and sat more purposefully on the sand, breathing deeply, forcing himself to meditate.</p>
<p>His revulsion retreated, and his stomach settled. He opened his eyes, watching the surf and the approaching clouds. Yes, yes, he knew these changes were going to happen. He had seen how the other pods acted, and there were several sets of sisters who were already pod-mates. None of them seemed troubled by their new arrangements. In fact, nearly all the mers engaged in outrageous public displays of affection. Why couldn&rsquo;t he rid himself of his guilt and shame?</p>
<p>One more feeding, and then he and his sisters would head for the mountainside pool. One more feeding &hellip; would that be enough to make his feelings of disgust and self-loathing go away? One more feeding.</p>
<p>He shook his head, rose, and began walking back towards the lagoon. After a few minutes, it began to rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much longer, do you think?&rdquo; Leonard asked, peering out at the rain lashing against the mountainside huts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to say,&rdquo; Liz answered, leaning her long, supple, and naked body out of the door, gazing towards the east where the sky seemed to suggest an easing of the dark gray clouds overhead. &ldquo;It should be safe to go up to the tub as soon as this dark patch passes. We don&rsquo;t want to be struck by lightning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, especially when all this &hellip; stuff &hellip; is about to happen,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>Again, Len admired Liz&rsquo;s extraordinary backside. He&rsquo;d followed it up from the beach for a good part of the afternoon, and he hadn&rsquo;t tired of the view. Liz&rsquo;s aristocratic breeding was evident in every part of her body. She was graceful, lean, and beautiful, a woman who might look equally at home riding a horse as slinking across a dance floor in an evening gown. Her shoulders were broad but lithe, her waist was high and small, and her hips were generous to a fault. From behind, she reminded Len of Jaclyn Smith from that television show, Charlie&rsquo;s Angels. From the front, Liz was almost a dead ringer for Catherine Deneuve. From any angle, she was a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Liz took a deep breath, smelling the rain, the earth, and the air. Not only could she walk again, but her senses had been reawakened. She could see, smell, and hear everything with heartbreaking clarity. She hugged herself as she stood in the doorway, feeling the her body&rsquo;s new energy and something else that had long been absent: her libido. She welcomed her reawakened passion, enjoying the thrill her body now gave her. She reached out an arm and caught some rain water in her cupped hand. She brought it back and splashed it over her breasts, gasping at the sensation.</p>
<p>She turned back around, feeling Len&rsquo;s hungry stare. Her nipples had crinkled up and were poking from her chest. She saw Len&rsquo;s eyes orient on her breasts and she subtly rolled her shoulders, watching his eyes move back and forth. A warmth ignited in her groin, rising quickly through her trim body, bringing color to her cheeks.</p>
<p>She moved her eyes over her future pod-mate, and admired his now trim and youthful physique. He noticed her noticing and blushed a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s weird, isn&rsquo;t it, being young again?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s lovely to feel young, alive, and able to walk,&rdquo; Liz said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s weird is that shortly, we&rsquo;ll both be mermaids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I guess when you put it that way,&rdquo; Len said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve dreamed of mermaids since you were a kid,&rdquo; Liz said, her tone softening. &ldquo;For me, becoming a mermaid was the price of my emancipation from my wheelchair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be a mermaid?&rdquo; Len asked, taken aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do now,&rdquo; Liz said. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t start out that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not even sure of what I&rsquo;m doing,&rdquo; Len admitted. &ldquo;But &hellip; well &hellip; I &hellip; just &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Liz walked over to Len, familiar now with his quirks and fears. She laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relax, Len,&rdquo; she said, smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere. In fact, in the last hour or so, I&rsquo;ve rather enjoyed feeling horny being near you. We&rsquo;re going to be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just feels like &hellip; I don&rsquo;t want &hellip;&rdquo; he kept trying.</p>
<p>Liz took his hand and brought it up to her chest. She clasped her other hand over his and pressed his hand to her sternum. Len stared at his hand, held by hers, resting between her breasts. Liz was classically proportioned, her breasts were two beautiful champagne glasses, modest B cups, topped with strawberry nipples now stiff with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Len, I&rsquo;ve grown quite fond of you, and I know that we&rsquo;re about to be joined in a bond closer than most people ever even dream of sharing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to do this, and I want you to be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m just frustrated not knowing what&rsquo;s going on,&rdquo; Len said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you a little bit, how&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she said, playfully moving the back of Len&rsquo;s hand across her breasts. &ldquo;As soon as these storm clouds pass, you and I will go up to the hot tub, and there, I am going to seduce you into having the best sex of your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Len said, startled. He looked again at the classic beauty before him. They were going to make love? This experiment was a far better experience than he expected! &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, leaning forward and kissing him, her cool blue eyes fixed on his. &ldquo;There, you feel better now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Len breathed, barely keeping his feet. Her kiss was so soft, so sensuous, making his entire body thrum. His cock stiffened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, the rain has slackened,&rdquo; she said, looking out the doorway to the hut. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; she said, pulling on his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grab that relay box,&rdquo; she said as they passed through the open door.</p>
<p>Len reached down and grabbed the small, black box as he walked out the door. Liz turned and walked forward, keeping Len&rsquo;s hand grasped in her own.</p>
<p>A light rain still fell, soaking them within a few steps. The rain pitter-pattered throughout the jungle as they walked, their rhythm slowing as they made their way along the narrow trail. Len&rsquo;s attention remained fixed on Liz&rsquo;s beautiful ass, watching it roll back and forth as she walked. He was entranced by the gap between her upper thighs, occasionally glimpsing a wisp of blond hair at the apex, a gap and an apex he too would soon possess. Finally, they reached the hot tub, the rain slackening as the sky began to lighten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that,&rdquo; Liz said, reaching for the black box.</p>
<p>She walked over to the cliff wall extending up from the ledge, carefully placing the box near one of the listening holes. She walked back to where Len stood, more or less shocked and excited all at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the pool,&rdquo; she urged, stepping down herself.</p>
<p>Len looked around, suddenly feeling as though someone was watching. He was about to check the path when Liz called to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Len, come here,&rdquo; she urged, holding her slim and youthful arms towards him, a smile on her face, her breasts reaching out towards him.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t resist her and walked into the pool. She gathered him into an embrace, kissing his neck, face, and lips. She moved slowly, keeping her body pressed against his, his throbbing erection wedged between them. She ran her hands along his back, teasing his nascent gills. He shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That felt amazing,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do mine,&rdquo; she urged.</p>
<p>Len raised his hands from her hips tracing his fingers lightly up her back until he brushed against her tender gill fronds. She sighed appreciatively, still kissing him slowly, gently. She leaned away from him, reaching down to grab his penis, and then pulling him as she waded back towards the far wall, the same one on which Peter/Pearl had perched, imagining her imaginary lover earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Liz scooted up onto the wall, still holding Len&rsquo;s stiff cock. She spread her legs and guided his cock towards her sex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch me,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look anywhere else, no matter what. You got that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Len nodded, unable to speak, watching this ravishing beauty, a sight right out of a movie fantasy, as she rubbed his cock head over her sex, teasing both of them to greater heights of anticipation and passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feels good, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Wonder what it will feel like once you&rsquo;re a girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Len nodded again, his heart pounding in his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Push it in, slowly,&rdquo; she said, positioning his cock just inside her folds.</p>
<p>She moved her hand from his cock to his hip, guiding him. Len pushed in slowly, feeling the rippling tight heat of her vagina as it opened slowly. She felt hotter and tighter than anyone else he could remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slowly,&rdquo; she said, pressing her hand against his hip.</p>
<p>Len backed off, just the tip of his cock resting inside her. When she nodded, he pushed again, realizing that Liz probably hadn&rsquo;t had a man inside her since her accident. His cock inched its way into her, bit by agonizingly wonderful bit. Finally, he was entirely within her. She wrapped her legs around his waist and pulled him into a kiss. He leaned forward, resting his hands on the rock wall, pressing his body lengthwise into hers. She moved her hips in little circles, loosening up her tight hold on his cock.</p>
<p>She thrust her tongue into his mouth, her passion rising. Len felt his own passion rising too, and was surprised, because he wasn&rsquo;t moving. Liz was so tight and so warm, that her little hip movements were more than enough to stimulate him towards an orgasm. He wanted to slow down, to enjoy this moment, and so he put one hand on her hip to slow her down.</p>
<p>His touch electrified her, and she moaned into their kisses. She held his face with both hands, kissing him and moving her body beneath him. Len felt the stirrings of an orgasm build, and seemed powerless to stop Liz from propelling both of them towards an orgasm too quickly.</p>
<p>He heard someone enter the water, but Liz held him in the kiss, and he remembered her admonition to hold her gaze. Her hips began to buck, and he started moving his hips back and forth. Together, they began to fuck in earnest. As Liz continued to move beneath him, a warm soft body slid up against him and two enormous breasts rubbed against his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Pearl,&rdquo; the soft, seductive voice said in his ear, and Len realized Peter must have transitioned on his own. He was about to turn towards her when he felt her hand press against his cheek. &ldquo;No peeking,&rdquo; Pearl said, kissing Len softly on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Liz reached up and pulled his face to hers, kissing him, silently urging him faster. Len could feel her lips moving and realized that she was saying &ldquo;fuck me, fuck me, fuck me&rdquo; under her breath. Len complied, thrusting into her in a frenzy. Len sensed someone next to Liz, and Pearl turned towards the new person. From the corner of his eye, he could see Pearl sucking on an enormous cock. It had to be Michael&rsquo;s, and realizing that, it both thrilled and frightened him.</p>
<p>Liz started moaning, and she came to her orgasm, her breasts starting to leak milk as her eyes rolled back in her head. She still held his face as she thrashed out a quick orgasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep fucking me,&rdquo; she urged, as she recovered.</p>
<p>Len stared into her eyes, nose to nose, slamming his hips into her, feeling his own orgasm miraculously continuing to build, not quite releasing, owing to the excruciating tightness at the base of his cock. He could hear Michael breathing as Pearl worked his cock, but Liz&rsquo;s fierce grip on his face prevented him from turning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me,&rdquo; she urged, a second orgasm rising up and taking her. &ldquo;Oh, god &hellip; god, that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip; my &hellip; Liz &hellip;&rdquo; Len grunted, getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>Liz watched his eyes as he pounded into her, and then just as Len felt the last peak in his orgasm build, she looked to her left.</p>
<p>The first jet of Len&rsquo;s orgasm ripped through his penis, and he nearly lost his footing. He felt the second pulse gather and heard a deep baritone voice call to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy, look at me,&rdquo; Michael ordered.</p>
<p>As Liz ground her hips into him, a second pulse raced out from Len&rsquo;s cock as he felt Michael&rsquo;s cock brush his cheek. He looked up and discovered Pearl holding Michael&rsquo;s now very impressive cock, pointing it at his mouth.</p>
<p>Time seemed to stop; nothing moved.</p>
<p>Len&rsquo;s entire world narrowed down into the infinity of this nanosecond, a brief space of time in between his own orgasmic squirts into Liz. Michael&rsquo;s penis hung before him, enormous, red, and alien. Len had never been this close to another man&rsquo;s penis in his life. He&rsquo;d never thought of doing what Michael wanted him to do. As another pleasurable pulse gathered deep within his own cock, Len&rsquo;s stomach clenched in fear and disgust. At that very same instant, he realized that Michael&rsquo;s cock offered the fulfillment of one of his greatest fantasies, to join these beautiful creatures, as a mermaid! All he had to do was lean forward, and &hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Lucy,&rdquo; Pearl encouraged as she slowly stroked Michael&rsquo;s cock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s delicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His heart pounded even faster in anticipation, a third pulse rose from his balls, and he leaned forward and took Michael&rsquo;s massive cock into his mouth, &lsquo;This is it!&rsquo; he thought.</p>
<p>Michael&rsquo;s first pulse matched Len&rsquo;s last.</p>
<p>The warm, salty fluid gushed in his mouth, and as the last, achingly beautiful pulse passed through his cock, Len felt a tingle rise along his spine and land at the base of his skull. A second pulse gushed from Michael&rsquo;s cock, and Lucy swallowed, feeling the warm liquid ease down her throat. She felt her cock quickly soften, slipping from Liz&rsquo;s warm vagina as a third pulse filled her mouth. A final pulse filled her mouth again, and she reflexively swallowed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie back,&rdquo; Michael urged, as both he and Pearl cradled her head in their hands. Michael stepped down from the rock wall where he had been standing.</p>
<p>Lucy let herself be guided back until she lay horizontal in the pool, her head cradled by Michael, who was now looking years younger. She felt Pearl and Liz come to her hips and support her legs and lower torso, as the energies unleashed by her spike in prolactin began their work.</p>
<p>Bubbles erupted around her, her body feeling like mush. She wanted to remind Michael of her desire to become Kelly Brook, but speech was beyond her. She felt Michael crouching down into the pool next to her, his face near hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your breath,&rdquo; he urged, lifting her up slightly.</p>
<p>She gasped in a breath, and Michael eased them both under the surface. She could see Michael&rsquo;s face through the veil of bubbles watching them finish his change to the younger version of himself. A searing pain tore through her torso and shattered her moment of tranquility, marking the start of her transformation. She doubled up into a fetal position, riding out the storm as her body was twisted, stretched, pushed, compressed, and reshaped. She felt the siren cells finally kick in and ease the sharp pain, reducing it to a dull, aching, throbbing pressure. She rode that wave of aching pressure as her body hurtled towards femininity.</p>
<p>A series of sharp bursts of pain signaled the forming of her new hips, her smaller frame, new facial structure, and her slender limbs. The pressure in her abdomen and chest signaled the emergence of new or newly awakened organs, and her hair began tugging at her scalp as she rolled in the water. After a several more minutes of discomfort, the bubbles abated and slowly came to a stop.</p>
<p>Lucy floated on the surface of the water, her breath easing in and out of her nose with a corresponding rise and fall of her chest. She could feel something there. She also felt the echoes of her last male orgasm still reverberating in a new emptiness she felt throbbing between her legs. As quickly as she focused on those echoes, the emptiness absorbed those vestiges of male lethargy, transforming them into a female readiness for more. That novel feeling spread outward from her hips in slow, persistent waves, bringing awareness of the width of her new hips, the new weights on her chest, the lightness of her new limbs, and finally the tug of her long hair on her head.</p>
<p>The hands supporting her helped her stand up, and she found herself in the pool, the water lapping at her hips. Her breasts were the first things she noticed. They both looked and felt enormous. Michael must have made a mistake, she thought. She looked up at Michael and saw his gaze locked onto her breasts. The look in his eyes made her feel good, actually, and she decided that perhaps he didn&rsquo;t make a mistake.</p>
<p>She looked over Pearl for the first time, and realized two things at once. First, that her new sister-wife&rsquo;s breasts were the equal, or even larger, than her own, and second, that Pearl was as entranced with her own new breasts as was Michael. Lucy felt even better after those realizations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s Lucy, is it?&rdquo; Liz asked, still recovering from her orgasms. &ldquo;From the book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Michael answered, not taking his eyes from Lucy&rsquo;s breasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; Liz asked, catching Lucy&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I look?&rdquo; she asked, her trepidation rising as she heard her new feminine voice for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a goddess,&rdquo; Pearl answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a goddess,&rdquo; Liz agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Kelly Brook,&rdquo; Michael said, lifting his eyes to her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Lucy, the Mermaid Scribe,&rdquo; Lucy said, smiling for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If one more self-important, pompous representative of a head-of-state calls this office, I&rsquo;m going to &hellip; going to &hellip;&rdquo; Lucia muttered to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to what?&rdquo; her boss asked from the other room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna have to kick some stuck-up-no-account-godforsaken-ass!&rdquo; she said, entering with an armful of papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I completely understand that sentiment,&rdquo; Bart said, rubbing his eyes and pushing himself away from his computer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why you always gotta talk so good,&rdquo; she challenged. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you just say, I&rsquo;m down with that. Something simple. Damn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be worse than me after law school,&rdquo; he teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, not likely,&rdquo; she said, setting the papers on the growing pile on his desk. &ldquo;A bunch of people from the old law firm have been calling you, like all day. How long do I halfta keep lying to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until I say otherwise, sorry,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;Besides, the next few days will either make all this go away, or it&rsquo;s going to be ten times worse than before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vote for go away,&rdquo; Lucia said, throwing herself into the seat across from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Bart agreed. &ldquo;But our votes only count for so much, and we&rsquo;re all wading into unknown waters here. I&rsquo;ve never tried to negotiate such a conference or summit or meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a conference or a summit or anything else,&rdquo; Lucia said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be a shitstorm; we already discussed this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I very much appreciate your candid honesty, but I could do with a little bit more irrational optimism, at the moment,&rdquo; Bart said, turning back to his computer. &ldquo;Do we have everyone&rsquo;s time zones worked out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loaded everyone&rsquo;s locations into Google Maps, and then sent them invitations based on everyone&rsquo;s variation from UTC,&rdquo; Lucia said. &ldquo;So, everyone should have the right time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time will that be &hellip;&rdquo; Bart said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For us,&rdquo; Lucia interrupted. &ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bart scanned the spreadsheet on his computer again, double checking everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I ask you something?&rdquo; Lucia asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When have I ever said that you couldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Bart asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I know, I can always ask, but you can&rsquo;t always answer,&rdquo; Lucia. &ldquo;What did you send to all those scientists this morning that changed everyone&rsquo;s tune? I mean, it was like we turned on a switch, and now everyone is calling us back and acting all worried about us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really want to know?&rdquo; Bart asked, turning towards her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never be the same after I give you the answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I want to know,&rdquo; Lucia said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent most of my life not knowing enough, and so, I&rsquo;m done with that. I want to know more, and I want to know why we spent two days begging people to take us seriously and then one day telling everybody to back off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard the phrase &lsquo;Doomsday Device&rsquo; haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Bart asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like science fiction, right?&rdquo; Lucia said. &ldquo;Some sort of bomb that will make the world end, like a super big nuclear bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close enough,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;The mers have discovered something that will pretty much do the same thing, only it&rsquo;s made out of bacteria, basically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Germs?&rdquo; Lucia said. &ldquo;Germs are gonna wipe out the whole planet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not really,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;But &hellip; now that I think about it, they sort of did already, probably a few times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Lucia asked. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there was the plague in the middle ages, which decimated human life in Europe and Asia, and nearly wiped out human life in the Americas,&rdquo; Bart said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, like Native Americans?&rdquo; Lucia asked. &ldquo;Nearly wiped out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Vikings had been trying to colonize the Americas for nearly 900 years and never succeeded,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;The Vikings &hellip; the badasses of Europe, and the native peoples on this continent kicked their butts back to Norway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, but the Pilgrims didn&rsquo;t get kicked out,&rdquo; Lucia said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;If the plague hadn&rsquo;t wiped out nearly eighty percent of the native population, none of the early colonies would have lasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, the mers have some sort of germ that will kill off humans?&rdquo; Lucia asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;They have created a bug that disaggregates seawater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dis-a-who?&rdquo; Lucia asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breaks down seawater into oxygen and hydrogen,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;Adding a huge amount of those two gases to the atmosphere would cause all organic life, plants, animals, &hellip; us &hellip; to burn up at room temperature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; Lucia said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s heavy shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No shit,&rdquo; Bart said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder everyone changed their tune,&rdquo; Lucia said. &ldquo;Are we in trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Bart asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could this dis-agra-something actually happen?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;Hopefully, what we&rsquo;re doing now will prevent that from ever happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m down with that,&rdquo; Lucia said, rising. &ldquo;Not burning up is at the top of my to-do list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The summit is in three days, and so there had better be some other things at the top of that list,&rdquo; Bart said, trying to keep some humor alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problemo, boss,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to check on that seaplane,&rdquo; Bart muttered. &ldquo;Thirty years of experience, and I&rsquo;m a shipping clerk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the lawyer! I&rsquo;m the shipping clerk,&rdquo; Lucia said, whipping out her cell phone. &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s a miracle you can use the computer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, I&rsquo;ll go back to soothing egos and confirming schedules,&rdquo; Bart said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I have the manifest? It&rsquo;s on the third pile from the left on your credenza,&rdquo; she asked, holding out her hand.</p>
<p>He turned, found it, gave it to her, and turned back to his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bottom left desk drawer,&rdquo; she said, turning to leave the office.</p>
<p>Bart reached down, opened the drawer, and saw the half bottle of whiskey in the drawer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Bart said, stopping her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Lucia asked, turning in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, reaching for both the bottle and the phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problemo,&rdquo; she said, winking and turning out of the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t wear this,&rdquo; Mac complained, removing the Service Dress Blue jacket and proffering it up to Jack. &ldquo;When you finally get your gills, you&rsquo;ll understand. Besides, I don&rsquo;t look like a retired admiral any more. I&rsquo;ll show them my Navy ID card, from when I first enlisted, and that should do the trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan thinks it will make a difference,&rdquo; Jack argued. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you just wear it for a few minutes, at the start of the polycom session?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two minutes, max,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;Seriously, having something other than your own hair over your gill fronds really messes up a mer. Jackson, relax. Getting all worked up will actually work against us. We have to project an air of competency or we&rsquo;re doomed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, you&rsquo;ve sat in the room yourself,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;I just wish Bart had given us more time. If we start now, I&rsquo;ll be in the middle of transition when the big conference call happens. Now I&rsquo;ll have to wait three more days before I can get my pod going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, I think that would be a mistake,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;I think you and Kyle should assemble your volunteers and get started. There needs to be more people with siren cells in their bodies, otherwise the four of us are exclusive&ndash;and relatively easy&ndash;targets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan wants to start a pod too,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;That would make four pods of the Camo-mers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;I liked her. How is she going to handle that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s ready to retire and has some trusted friends who share her twisted sense of adventure, are also single, and want a second chance at life,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twisted?&rdquo; Joy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s never been further than two hours from Washington, DC in her entire life,&rdquo; Jack explained. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s been dreaming of escaping to a south sea island since she was a little girl. Never thought about the mermaid angle, but she&rsquo;s dreamed about living in paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s o.k. with the mermaid angle?&rdquo; Joy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, seems weird, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to me,&rdquo; Bonnie said, stretching out along the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, what are you waiting for? Go get Kyle and get your pods assembled and get back here as soon as possible,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;I hate being the only good target in a room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First put in a call to Bart and get him to up the number of headbands from Pat,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;We might as well have a few extras while we&rsquo;re at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I tell him?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make it 24, and see what that does for us,&rdquo; Joy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another day, another data point,&rdquo; Phoebe said, dusting off the detector mirror on their new spectrometer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clean mad scientist is a happy mad scientist,&rdquo; Pat said, glancing around the busy lab cave, watching all the activity.</p>
<p>James and his pod were here because they now had all sorts of medical equipment to be used for wellness, rather than for experimentation or exploration, and they were arranging a new &ldquo;medical area&rdquo; of the lab cave that would be dedicated towards advancing what the mers knew about their diet, exercise, and injuries, even though mermaid milk took care of most of those. They were just finishing up their new corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long did Rose say it would take her pod to get those headbands done?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that everyone in that pod can make them, it should only take an hour or so,&rdquo; Phoebe answered. &ldquo;They had to swim to the north side of the island to find a good upwelling current.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got to figure out a way to get others to learn how to make these headbands, or Trevor&rsquo;s pod will be forced to do these by the hundreds,&rdquo; Pat muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose is working on it, she&rsquo;s been working with Eric and Sally, and Eric seems really close. He said the ones he makes almost work,&rdquo; Phoebe said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Da, that is where they are now,&rdquo; Alexis confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;We really should bring Eric back in now that we have all this new equipment. We might learn something about how he sees our CHEW connections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not like your instruments,&rdquo; Alexis said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re your instruments too,&rdquo; Pat teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My instruments are right here,&rdquo; Alexis said, lifting her hair to reveal a breast. &ldquo;He likes these instruments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Galina, when did Bart say that airplane would arrive?&rdquo; Pat asked, switching subjects.</p>
<p>Galina opened up the email account and checked Bart&rsquo;s email. &ldquo;He does not say exactly, but it is this afternoon. I would say not for at least three more hours, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s the case, let&rsquo;s send a message up top to Michael and his girls that as soon as they see the plane leave, they need to switch places with Emma and the Basras,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;They can hang out on the beach for a one or two days while Emma finishes up her stage two transition in case we need humans on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do after the everyone transition to mers?&rdquo; Phoebe asked. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have anyone human left on the island, and then next delivery or shipment will have to be made to mers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to talk to Bart about that, see what he thinks we ought to do,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, what good news do you have for us today?&rdquo; Elise asked, salamandering up to Pat. &ldquo;How much have those little purple pills been able to tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, quite a bit,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;We have a much better understanding of the early stages of mer development and the mechanisms for bonding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us the highlights,&rdquo; James said, joining his pod-mate at Pat&rsquo;s table. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t read most of what&rsquo;s written there,&rdquo; he said, waving his hands at the several computer screens in front of Pat&rsquo;s station.</p>
<p>Pat glanced over the notes and reports arranged over several screens. Nearly everything they did in the lab was recorded as a mixture of math, English, and Russian, a common habit that the four scientists had fallen into without ever talking about it. She smiled, it was almost like a security feature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve discovered that the three mer organs along our spines are created by Type II siren cells, so both bonding and mer senses are available to proto-mers who have completed Stage II transformations,&rdquo; Pat explained. &ldquo;These organs become bigger and more powerful after Stage III transformations. We&rsquo;ve also discovered that mermaid milk is also the key to most of the behaviors and benefits we&rsquo;ve experienced as mers. It&rsquo;s actually extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It changed us into mers, of course it&rsquo;s extraordinary,&rdquo; James agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean it affects all kinds of biological and psychological systems in our bodies,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;For example, most female mammals who are lactating have elevated glucocorticoid levels, which tends to decrease testosterone in surrounding males. That lowered testosterone encourages males to be less aggressive with each other and more helpful to the females who are with a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not the case with us, right?&rdquo; James asked. &ldquo;Mermaids lactate regardless of their gravidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gravidity?&rdquo; Phoebe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Archaic, the state of being pregnant or not,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always a lesson, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Phoebe said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not my fault,&rdquo; Pat protested. &ldquo;He said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were explaining,&rdquo; James said with a smile at Phoebe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, sorry,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;In the case of mers, females have high glucocorticoid levels but males do not have a corresponding lower level of testosterone. In fact, mermen have very high levels of testosterone compared to normal human men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, the lactating females encourage strong bonds within each pod, and the high testosterone is why we can never have two or more males in the presence of a single mermaid,&rdquo; James surmised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we think that males would actually be even more aggressive if they were un-bonded,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve never had an unbonded male,&rdquo; James said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct, and since all our children are born female, that&rsquo;s likely to be a very rare occurrence,&rdquo; Pat continued. &ldquo;However, merman aggression is tamed by the very high sex drives among both female and male mers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s just for a safer world that we have sex all the time,&rdquo; John joked. &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ll say anything to get laid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to say anything to get laid,&rdquo; Phoebe said, grinning. &ldquo;You get laid no matter what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sex is almost as powerful as mermaid milk, and so it&rsquo;s not surprising that the two are linked,&rdquo; Pat continued. &ldquo;Our bonding is reinforced each time we orgasm, which also helps keep male aggression in check, which also stimulates more lactation in females, which also strengthens bonding, which also helps keep aggression in check, which also stimulates our libidos, etc., etc., etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that all this talk has &hellip;&rdquo; James started, but he was yanked into the pool by Debra and Bridget, with Elise fast on their flukes. They tumbled into the water and were quickly entwined in the center of the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a really good idea,&rdquo; Phoebe said with a predatory look at John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, just a minute,&rdquo; John began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on up here? Is someone transforming? All the kids went into sleep mode,&rdquo; said Danni her head popping up from the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Phoebe said with a growl, curling her tail beneath her, readying herself for a spring at John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yikes,&rdquo; John said, launching himself towards Danni. &ldquo;Protect me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tumbled gracelessly into the water, splashing water everywhere. Phoebe launched herself after him, gracefully arching in the air, slicing into the water near Danni and John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry ladies, but it&rsquo;s better to make love than war,&rdquo; Pat said, salamandering towards the pool.</p>
<p>Alexis and Galania looked at each other, realizing their pod-mates were all at the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than nothing,&rdquo; Alexis said, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than most things,&rdquo; Galina said, waving her arm down her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Alexis said, and she shuffled over and embraced her fellow scientist in a fluke curling kiss.</p>
<p>Malaki seethed in his captivity. He was bound and gagged through most of the day and night, force fed food and water twice a day, and once a day he was dragged through the surf to clean off the grime and his own waste. No prisoner in the world had to put up with such degradation! He fumed in silence in his hut.</p>
<p>Of course, if someone had been there to argue with him, they might have pointed to the countless prisoners, prostitutes, and kidnapped victims who had been treated as badly or worse by his own men over the years. Malaki would not have enjoyed the irony, of course, and probably wouldn&rsquo;t even recognize it as irony.</p>
<p>His situation was hopeless, but he had experience with hopelessness. Sure, he was stuck on an island everyone in his organization thought was uninhabited, if they even knew the island existed. Sure, his sole, surviving son was an idiot, a brute of a man who was more dangerous than he was useful. He knew death was preferable to most of his other options, for the moment, but he was too stubborn to simply roll over and die. No, he would not make it easy for these monsters.</p>
<p>He resumed the isometric exercises, trying to build strength back into his limbs. The mers had stopped giving him venom in the water, and his strength and energy had returned. If he had an opportunity, he was going to make these monsters pay. For the moment, he cared little for survival, or so he told himself. He existed solely to cause these creatures pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Lucy walked towards the mountainside huts, noticing the clouds slowly clearing as the sun grew brighter. The colors and textures in the jungle seemed more vivid and alive now than on her walk up to the tub only a short time ago. The greens were more varied and more lush, the browns were deeper and richer, it was almost like she could smell color.</p>
<p>Not only was her surroundings more alive, her own body seemed more alive. It certainly moved more. Her hips rolled with every step she took, and her breasts never seemed to stop moving. She glanced backwards to check in on Pearl and was grateful, for a moment, that her own breasts weren&rsquo;t as big as her pod-mate&rsquo;s. Pearl&rsquo;s breasts jumped and wobbled like two fighting roosters tied to the same stake. Lucy looked at Liz&rsquo;s round ass ahead of her, and noted how her own small waist and wide hips were closer to Liz&rsquo;s than Pearl&rsquo;s. Yes, Lucy thought to herself, I may not be exactly like Kelly Brook, but I&rsquo;m not unlike Pearl and Liz; I&rsquo;m a mix of all three models.</p>
<p>Ahead, she could see Michael&rsquo;s back, and she imagined his now flaccid cock bobbing along in front of him. Fear and desire stabbed in her gut, and she wondered if her fear would ever go away. She suspected that they were going to have sex, all four of them, in the huts, but she had been kept in the dark for so long that she was prepared for anything to happen.</p>
<p>She watched as Michael entered the main hut, but Pearl called out from behind and told him to wait a few minutes. She waved the other two girls towards one of the smaller huts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s sort of cliche, but I wanted to do something with you girls,&rdquo; she explained as she entered Patrick&rsquo;s old bedroom hut. She walked over to the small bed and loosened the strings to one of the collection bags the mers normally used to collect food. Once the opening was wide enough, Pearl upended the bag onto the bed. A variety of women&rsquo;s clothing tumbled out in all shapes, sizes, and colors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dreaming of being a girl my whole life,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;And I just wanted to wear one pretty thing before I became a mermaid, and then couldn&rsquo;t wear much of anything. You can laugh at me if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; Liz exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly understandable. The first thing I wanted to do was walk, and so the first thing you wanted to do was be a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Liz,&rdquo; Pearl said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been worrying about this moment, thinking that you girls would think I was silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Liz said. &ldquo;Right Lucy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy looked up, caught staring at what looked like a red nightie. She blushed. &ldquo;Um, no, of course not,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s not like we will ever have the chance again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Pearl said, her eyes gleaming with excitement. &ldquo;I only wish we had a mirror so I could do makeup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure there is a mirror in the other hut, but make up is out of the question,&rdquo; Liz said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is any on the island. We&rsquo;ll have to make do with what we have here. What do you want to try on first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This!&rdquo; Pearl said as she reached for a simple sundress. She held it up, showing it to Liz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it will fit me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one way to find out,&rdquo; Liz said. &ldquo;Put it on. Now, how about you, Lucy. Did you ever cross dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, staring at the collection of female clothing before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there something wrong?&rdquo; Liz asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Lucy said, feeling her blush rise to her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one do you want to try on?&rdquo; Liz repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Lucy said, suddenly feeling like she was the boy in a girl&rsquo;s locker room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just pick something!&rdquo; Pearl said, dancing with her dress as though it was a partner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to wear a dress, and it&rsquo;s going to fit!&rdquo; she said, stopping and lifting the dress over her head.</p>
<p>Lucy watched Pearl shimmy into the yellow, tube style, sundress. Pearl had to keep pulling and tugging to get the dress over her breasts, and then she bent over at the waist, pulled the front of the dress towards the floor, let her breasts dangle freely, snugged the front back over her breasts, and stood back up, flipping her long brown hair behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like you&rsquo;ve done that before,&rdquo; Liz remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water balloons,&rdquo; Pearl said, adjusting her breasts inside the dress. &ldquo;The real thing is so much better. Well, how do I look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy&rsquo;s vagina twitched as she looked at the sexy woman before her. Pearl&rsquo;s hair framed her face, with one strand curling over her shoulder, resting on the impressive shelf of her breast. The fabric was stretched tight over her body, conforming to the dramatic shape of Pearl&rsquo;s torso from the tops of her breasts to the middle of her hips, and then the bright fabric fell freely to just below her knees. Pearl twirled in the dress, making it flare out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! I don&rsquo;t need straps to hold this dress up,&rdquo; Pearl said, pointing at top hem of the dress stretched tight over her deep cleavage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly believe you got it on,&rdquo; Liz said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s going on in there?&rdquo; Michael asked from the other hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re dressing for dinner,&rdquo; Pearl shouted. &ldquo;Find something to wear, some shorts or something. We&rsquo;re all wearing something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what you were talking to Petra about earlier,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll throw on some shorts. Don&rsquo;t be too long, I&rsquo;m hungry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are too,&rdquo; Pearl shouted back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare start without us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy?&rdquo; Liz asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Lucy said, feeling like her next decision would be a wrong one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy, you&rsquo;re a beautiful woman, you&rsquo;re allowed to wear these things,&rdquo; Liz reassured her. &ldquo;How about this one,&rdquo; she indicated the red, lace confection that Lucy had been staring at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that nightie even fit?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually called a baby doll, and so it should fit nearly anyone, though both you and Pearl are pretty big on top,&rdquo; Liz said, lifting the red garment towards Lucy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful,&rdquo; Lucy said, fingering the shimmering lace between her fingers. &ldquo;But &hellip; um, how do I &hellip; I mean, where does this &hellip;&rdquo; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me help you,&rdquo; Liz said, lifting it up. &ldquo;Hold your arms up, that&rsquo;s right. My, that makes your breasts look absolutely spectacular. Hold still, no&ndash;keep your arms up, yes I know that feels good, but wait until we get you settled. I&rsquo;m going to settle your breast into the cup, alright? Good. How does that feel?&rdquo; she asked, her own nipples stiffening as she moved Lucy&rsquo;s incredible breasts around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good, I guess,&rdquo; Lucy said, wishing Liz hadn&rsquo;t stopped touching her breast. She twirled like Pearl, enjoying the slight compression of the material across her new and impressive bust as the bottom fluttered around her thighs. &ldquo;What are you going to wear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Liz said, eyeing the pile of clothes. She picked up a simple, white, silk robe. &ldquo;This will do. I&rsquo;ve worn lots of women&rsquo;s clothes in my time. Besides, I don&rsquo;t think any of us are going to be wearing any of this much longer. If Michael doesn&rsquo;t rip that dress off, I may have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare! I&rsquo;m wearing it for all of dinner,&rdquo; Pearl said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starving. Let&rsquo;s eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three women walked out of the small hut and back to the larger one. They found Michael arranging the food he and Pearl had brought up earlier on the large bed that John had constructed after Patrick had become Patricia.</p>
<p>He looked up and froze. The three beautiful women had unconsciously posed as they entered the room, and they took his breath away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we look?&rdquo; Pearl asked, turning in profile a bit more, arching her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wow &hellip; wow,&rdquo; he said, his shorts quickly tenting in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take that as really, really, good,&rdquo; Liz said, moving to sit on one edge of the bed, artfully allowing one side of her robe to open, exposing her breasts and belly. &ldquo;Pearl, you come sit by me. I&rsquo;ve already had my way with Lucy, and you&rsquo;ve already had your&rsquo;s with Michael, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer, and Liz turned and saw that Pearl was looking into a mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pearl?&rdquo; Liz repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was part of the experiment,&rdquo; Pearl said absently, stroking her face as she admired herself for the first time. &ldquo;Each of us in turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love these experiments,&rdquo; Michael said with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It worked!&rdquo; Pearl said rapturously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needed a reflection to tell you that?&rdquo; Liz teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; Pearl agreed, hefting her breasts in her hands. &ldquo;But I ended up looking a lot like Cynthia Myers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s who you remind me of!&rdquo; Lucy said. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t think of her name! She was the first playmate born in the 1950s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my girls span the decades,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pearl, can I?&rdquo; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she said, stepping aside to allow her sister-wife access to the mirror. She joined Liz on the bed as Lucy stepped up to the mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my,&rdquo; Lucy gasped.</p>
<p>She ran her fingers along her lips, down her chin, and along her neck. She was almost a dead ringer for Kelly Brook, but there was something off. What was it? She was certainly beautiful. Her hair framed her face just like the original, her eyes were large and expressive, her lips full and sensuous, and her features elf-like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you, Lucy, ready for another stage of the experiment?&rdquo; Michael asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humm?&rdquo; she said, lost in the beauty of her own reflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is everything alright?&rdquo; Liz asked, sensing Lucy&rsquo;s confusion with her proto-mer senses and the early bond she shared with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s not right?&rdquo; Lucy said, studying her reflection. &ldquo;Blue eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with blue eyes?&rdquo; Michael asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m partial to blue eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kelly Brook has brown eyes, and mine are blue,&rdquo; Lucy explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Lucy exclaimed. &ldquo;I like blue eyes too, and I&rsquo;m actually really happy that I&rsquo;m not simply a copy of her. I&rsquo;m Lucy; I&rsquo;m me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad you&rsquo;re you too,&rdquo; Michael agreed. &ldquo;Now, we have an experiment to finish, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy looked at Michael and saw his bulge stretching the front of his shorts. She felt the same mix of desire and fear, but she was determined to overcome her fears. The best defense is a good offense, she decided, and walked over to Liz, leaning over until her breasts reached across Liz&rsquo;s shoulder and brushed against her sister-wife&rsquo;s face. Lucy watched Michael&rsquo;s eyes as they watched her lace clad nipple brush back and forth along Liz&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we continue, is there anything else I&rsquo;m not supposed to know about?&rdquo; Lucy asked, doing her best to look innocent and helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the lawyer,&rdquo; Michael teased. &ldquo;What does the evidence suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I still a lawyer?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if I feel like one anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look like one either,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;But you will always have that bright and sharp mind, that incredible memory, and your wicked sense of humor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not freaked out?&rdquo; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; Michael asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Lucy admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; he said with warmth and patience. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re beautiful, you&rsquo;re still smart and funny, and there are no more surprises, or at least none that I know about. Pat wanted readings of a change when prolactin levels were likely at their lowest possible ebb. We created that situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is for sure,&rdquo; Lucy said, running a hand along Liz&rsquo;s neck, down her collarbone and into the valley of her cleavage. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever felt so male in my life. I had no idea you were so passionate,&rdquo; Lucy said as she bent over, simultaneously kissing Liz&rsquo;s neck and caressing her breasts. Liz&rsquo;s breasts felt wonderful in her hand, and her skin beneath her lips was soft and sensuous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can only kiss me if you&rsquo;re feeding me,&rdquo; Liz sighed, teasing Michael by twisting to show Lucy&rsquo;s hand on her breast. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry,&rdquo; she said with a pointed look at Pearl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then try some of this,&rdquo; Pearl said, placing some fruit along the top of her dress over her cleavage. &ldquo;See how you like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off you go, to Michael, don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; Liz urged Lucy, giving her a gentle push on her hips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to eat some of that,&rdquo; she said, scooting over to Pearl and positioning herself before her incredible breasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let&rsquo;s start with this,&rdquo; Michael said, holding a piece of fruit in his fingers.</p>
<p>Lucy walked over to him, clasping her hands behind her back, pushing her lace-clad breasts towards him. She watched him watch her breasts as she walked to him and then took the fruit from his fingers with her lips. She kissed his fingers after she chewed on the tangy fruit. The touch of his fingers on her lips sent sent spasms of pleasure through her body. Her fears began to ebb, slowly overwhelmed by her growing confidence and desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More please,&rdquo; she said, looking up at him through her lashes, feeling like her breasts were growing, swelling with her passion as she stood there.</p>
<p>Michael fed Lucy several bits and pieces of fruit, fish, and greens, his fingers lingering along her lips, chin, and nose. The heat between her legs grew, and she became more aggressive, snapping up the food from his fingers, licking and sucking each digit to get all the juices from the fruit and the morsels of dried fish.</p>
<p>When she was done, Michael sat down on the bed and held out a hand with food in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feed me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Lucy reached down, took a piece of fish, and straddled one of his legs, feeling the heat from her crotch radiate downward. She fed him once piece of food at a time, rocking her hips slightly, feeling her body move as she fed him. When she had exhausted what was in Michael&rsquo;s hand, she reached forward, brushing one of her lace clad breasts into his shoulder, grabbed some more food, and then stood back up. The burning look of desire in his eyes made her shudder with anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to eat this food, or we&rsquo;ll die,&rdquo; Liz said, nuzzling the top of Pearl&rsquo;s breasts. &ldquo;So, do not take your dress off yet, or I&rsquo;ll never make it back to the food,&rdquo; she said as she gave one last lick and turned back to the pile of food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you eat some more, too,&rdquo; Michael said, reaching blindly behind his back, gathering a few morsels of food, and then bringing them forward to the goddess standing before him.</p>
<p>As Lucy extended her hand to his mouth, she leaned forward causing his rising hand to brush against her breast. Her nipple was poking out under the lace, a thimble sized rise of flesh, and his fingers flicked it back and forth as his hand rose past it. She moaned as he inserted the food into her mouth but was overwhelmed by the feeling that she had wet herself. As she slowly chewed the fruit in her mouth, she realized that she hadn&rsquo;t accidentally peed. She was a woman who was powerfully aroused.</p>
<p>She fed Michael another piece of fish and found herself looking at his face in a way she had never done before. She remembered examining many female faces and being mesmerized by the graceful curve of a neck, the soft down of hair behind an ear, the wide pools of a pair of beautiful eyes. Now she was looking at the tiny cleft in his chin, the deep recesses of his piercing blue eyes, the rich, unruly forest of his hair. He looked a little bit like a young, Robert Redford, she thought. For the first time in her life, she thought that Robert Redford was HOT.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michael &hellip; you&rsquo;re &hellip; you&rsquo;re beautiful!&rdquo; Lucy whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my goddess,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;Though I think the preferred term is handsome, when speaking of the male sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s new to the girl thing, give her time,&rdquo; Liz said, helping Pearl peel her dress down from her now visible breasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy, you are simply and amazingly beautiful,&rdquo; Michael said, reaching up and pulling her in for a kiss.</p>
<p>As they kissed, Lucy slowly sank down until she straddled his thigh. Her naked vagina was pressed into his leg, and a spasm of pleasure jerked her body as she felt another&rsquo;s touch in her most private of places for the first time. It was the first time anything had pressed against her vagina, not even her own hand. She sighed into his kiss, putting her full weight onto his thigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip; oh &hellip; god,&rdquo; she whispered, her body buffeted by a whirlwind of sensations she had never felt before.</p>
<p>It felt like her crotch was on fire; a wet, liquid, unquenchable fire. She ground herself down on his thigh, her lower lips making slippery squishing sounds as she rocked back and forth. Michael wrapped his arms around her tiny waist and thrust his tongue into her mouth.</p>
<p>Michael fell back onto the bed, still kissing, pulling Lucy with him. She felt the bed sink as Liz and Pearl lay along side them, the heat from their bodies stoking the flames of passion rising in her own body. She pressed her body against Michael&rsquo;s as they kissed, his hard cock pressing into her stomach, separated from her by the gossamer material she was wearing. She growled! She wanted skin to skin contact!</p>
<p>She pushed herself up from his embrace, straddling his waist, his cock pressed up against the crack of her ass. She crossed her arms and grabbed the baby doll and pulled it over her head, her breasts bouncing free. She threw the garment off to the side and pounced back onto Michael, kissing his lips, face, neck, and chest. Michael&rsquo;s hands roamed her back, sides, ass, and thighs, stroking her nascent gills, sending shivers throughout her body.</p>
<p>She arched her hips up into the air, allowing Michael&rsquo;s cock to flop forward onto his belly, and then pressed her hot, liquid fire on top of it, stroking it with her hips, coating his cock with her juices. Her entire body was quivering with need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do that much longer, and we&rsquo;re going to have to start over,&rdquo; he said, gasping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked, confused, unsure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, was I doing something wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! You&rsquo;re amazing,&rdquo; he reassured her, holding her hips still. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to be inside you when I cum. It&rsquo;s the experiment, remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, right! Well, we can&rsquo;t ruin the experiment,&rdquo; Lucy said, lifting her hips.</p>
<p>She glanced down past her dangling breasts and aligned her new opening with the bobbing head of Michael&rsquo;s throbbing cock. After two missed attempts, Michael reached down and held it steady while she lowered her hips onto his cock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oooohhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhh,&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
<p>It burned as it went in, a wonderful, liquid burning, steadily increasing as she lowered her hips. Inch by inch it went in, and up and up leapt the fire. A spurt of fire splashed up her spine, causing her to gasp; she reached her hymen! Her insides were boiling, and she gently pressed down, but the pain spiked in the fire, arresting her movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooouuuuucccchhhhhhh,&rdquo; she said, trying to hold her hips steady, fighting the fire that forced her hips downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relax,&rdquo; Michael said, stroking her sides. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back under control, take your time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked down at him, his eyes now filled with tenderness, making her heart melt. She nodded, flipped her hair back from her face, bit her lip, and slowly pressed her hips down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhoooooooooooooo,&rdquo; she said as she felt the steel rod of his penis slowly push through the molten glass of her hymen, shattering it. She froze.</p>
<p>When the prickly, fiery sparks of pain ebbed, she resumed pushing her hips down until her labia were sealed around the bottom of his cock. They both held their position, feeling the incredible connection rising within them. There was the literal and physical connection made by Michael&rsquo;s cock buried deep within her, but it was layered with an ethereal connection twisting up her spine, embracing her heart, and tickling her brain. It was so powerful and so physically transformative that she started crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy?&rdquo; Liz asked, her growing connection to Pearl disrupted by Lucy&rsquo;s wild swings in mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s O.K.,&rdquo; Lucy said softly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just &hellip; so &hellip; it&rsquo;s so &hellip; beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are,&rdquo; Liz said, shivering herself as Pearl buried another finger in her vagina. &ldquo;And so are you,&rdquo; she said, kissing Pearl deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are so beautiful, my little Lucy,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;Lucy the Mermaid! Just look at you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a mermaid yet,&rdquo; she said, starting to move her hips. &ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re so big &hellip; it&rsquo;s so &hellip; ahhhhhhhh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She collapsed back down onto Michael&rsquo;s chest, her vagina throbbing around his cock. Her first orgasm raced through her, leaving her breathless for a few seconds, but her need blossomed quickly in its wake. She feverishly kissed his face and lips, her hips twitching as his cock stretched and filled her.</p>
<p>She gasped as his strong hands grabbed her hips, lifting them up a few inches. She put her weight on her forearms and knees, feeling her breasts dangle and rest on his chest. She continued to devour his face and lips, raining kisses down upon him. Michael raised his knees and levered his hips up into her ass, slapping against it wetly. Lucy lifted her head so she could see his face, her jostling breasts dancing back and forth across his chest. She began moaning uncontrollably, her body shaking, pounded by Michael&rsquo;s pistoning hips. The fire spread from her crotch to her chest, her nipples skittering like hot coals across Michael&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>Liz' and Pearl&rsquo;s moans broke through her awareness, and their passion stoked hers higher and higher. Her head buzzed with pleasure as her thighs, ass, and breasts rippled from Michael&rsquo;s relentless assault. After a flurry of lightning thrusts, Michael groaned and pushed himself deeply into her, lifting both of their bodies off the bed. Lucy felt him twitch inside her, grunting as he released his seed. Another spurt erupted inside her, and suddenly her second orgasm gripped her. A tornado spun madly in her belly, and she cried out, her vagina clutching forcefully around Michael&rsquo;s cock. The spinning and clutching, spinning and clutching, spinning and clutching mounted higher and higher until her eyes rolled back in her head, and she collapsed onto Michael&rsquo;s body, riding out the long, wonderful echoes of her second, but more massive female orgasm.</p>
<p>Michael gently held Lucy as she quivered, moaned, and twitched, the huge orgasm overwhelming her. As her breasts pressed into his chest, he swore he could feel a thread of electricity spark from her chest into his, his own heart leaping in his body. He had never felt closer to another person before in his life, not even Johanna.</p>
<p>Two hours later, Michael and his girls arrived back down on the beach as the Basras and a now youthful and fully healed Emma headed for the mountainside huts. They had hung back, respectively keeping their distance as Emma said goodbye to her daughters. Once MuSu&rsquo;s pod had disappeared under the surf, Michael&rsquo;s walked out onto the beach. He set down the bag of clothing they had brought down from the huts and watched as his three girls skipped out into the waves, washing the jungle off their bodies. A few moments later, Bill&rsquo;s pod emerged from the water near them, and Michael hurried to join them, his protective instincts kicking in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey guys, you all are looking great!&rdquo; Bill said, gazing at the three women who played in the surf. &ldquo;Ouch, what?&rdquo; he complained to Mae who gave him a playful pinch and a glare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get to the point and quit gawking,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, right. So, Michael, Pat asked me to tell you that we&rsquo;re going to keep you topside for a few days,&rdquo; He said, rubbing his side. &ldquo;With the possibility of a lot of unexpected minute traffic here, in the next few days, we thought we should keep some one relatively human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes sense,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to wear swimsuits!&rdquo; Pearl gushed. &ldquo;Oh, Lucy, you&rsquo;ll be a mermaid soon enough! Come on, let&rsquo;s see if our gills work yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, yes, they should be working but you&rsquo;ll need to be careful,&rdquo; Mae said, unhooking a utility bag from Bill&rsquo;s belt. &ldquo;We think these should all fit.&rdquo; They could see several swimsuits in the bag. &ldquo;We made the back straps wider and softer on the bikini&rsquo;s and the neck straps won&rsquo;t hit your gills, so just keep the back strap lightly tied, and it shouldn&rsquo;t irritate your gills too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; Pearl said, taking the bag and rushing back up onto the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can spend most of your time naked, if you like,&rdquo; Bill said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make sure to send someone if we know someone is coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the Basras and Emma?&rdquo; Michael asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see once they come back from their stage two transitions,&rdquo; Bill said. &ldquo;It depends on how strong Martin feels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to take her son&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; Lucy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as an homage to her family,&rdquo; Mae answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, makes sense. We&rsquo;ll await further instructions,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll continue work on bonding,&rdquo; Liz said with a gleam in her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just keep an eye out for the capsules,&rdquo; Bill said. &ldquo;Save them in the little bags, and we&rsquo;ll recharge them and use them again when you transition to mers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will do,&rdquo; Michael said, watching as Bill&rsquo;s pod returned to the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Timi and Ragi hardly ever say anything,&rdquo; Lucy noted. &ldquo;Why do you think that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t really know,&rdquo; Michael admitted. &ldquo;Maybe you can ask them the next time you see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not working,&rdquo; Sudhish said. &ldquo;What am I doing wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your fault,&rdquo; Rani said, her big, soft, brown eyes filling with tears. &ldquo;We are too weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Vidya chimed in. &ldquo;We cannot overpower you. It is our fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudhish stood between his two sisters in the center of the rocky pool as the late afternoon sunlight danced all around them. Everyone was bursting with siren cells. Emma watched the three of them from the edge of the jungle, herself equally young, healthy, her face restored to its former beauty, her body brimming with siren cells. Sudhish looked skyward and groaned mightily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I cannot &hellip; I am keeping both of you out, I am fighting what is happening to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not love us?&rdquo; Vidya asked, surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do love you, my sister,&rdquo; Sudhish said, the look on her face breaking his heart. &ldquo;That is the problem. I love you as no brother ought to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will no longer be my brother,&rdquo; Vidya said. &ldquo;You will be my sister-wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know &hellip; I know,&rdquo; Sudhish said, looking down in shame. &ldquo;I cannot submit to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think submission is in your nature,&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;You should not view this as a weakness on your part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! You did not see me powerless in Malaki&rsquo;s office for all those weeks, helpless and afraid,&rdquo; Sudhish said bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lacking the power or opportunity to save your sisters does not mean that you are submissive,&rdquo; Emma said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Peter was able to change, and even Valencia was able to change with her pod-mate&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; Sudhish protested. &ldquo;I must be able to succeed at something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success comes in many forms,&rdquo; Emma said, her slender, youthful body seeming to possess much more power and stature than a normal twentyfive -year-old girl might have. &ldquo;Your courage in even considering this path makes you, by one measure, successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vidya put a hand on his shoulder, trying to comfort him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Sudhish said, flinching and pulling away. The hurt on her face struck him to his heart. &ldquo;Sorry. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart is full of love for you,&rdquo; Vidya said, her oval, innocent face fully restored to health and beauty. &ldquo;Why is there such fear and anger in you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you feeling, dear brother?&rdquo; Rani asked, taking a step towards him.</p>
<p>Sudhish looked at his beautiful sisters as conflicting emotions battling within. They were beautiful, desirable, and clearly looking at him with affection, but they were also his sisters. His brotherly instincts were under assault, and while his feelings must change, he couldn&rsquo;t let go of his male ego, his sense of honor. He saw the hurt, confusion, and rejection in his sister&rsquo;s eyes, and his overblown sense of personal failure and self-loathing mushroomed.</p>
<p>Why do you dislike us?&quot; Rani asked plaintively, adding to anguish in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am trapped by my honor,&rdquo; he said, heavily. &ldquo;I have sworn to replace Geeta, but I cannot stop feeling like your brother. I could not save you before, and now I cannot join you as your sister. I am a failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sudhish, you are not a failure. Girls are naturally more flexible in their affections than men,&rdquo; Emma argued. &ldquo;Sudhish, you are perfectly normal, and we should not be surprised that such an honorable and powerful young man should find this transition difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudhish looked at the small woman who planned on becoming the merman to his mermaid. Despite her small size, she radiated power, patience, and persistence. She was speaking truth, a truth cutting like a knife into the heart of his inadequacies. Everything seemed an assault on his very core, what he understood himself to be. His emotions and anger threatened to boil over again, but he controlled his anger and forced himself to consider&ndash;again&ndash;both his vow and Emma&rsquo;s wise words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well that you should be the man in our pod,&rdquo; Sudhish said. &ldquo;I only wish I had your strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have too much strength, that&rsquo;s the problem,&rdquo; Emma said. &ldquo;Are you certain that you should pursue this path?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sworn,&rdquo; Sudhish said. &ldquo;I will not waver. But I cannot do it to myself. I have failed in yet another task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forbid you to say that about yourself again, ever!&rdquo; Emma said, seeming to grow a foot taller as she said it. &ldquo;Do you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudhish both admired and grew jealous of her power. How he wished he had her strength of will. He nodded, and she nodded back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sudhish needs someone bigger to hold him down,&rdquo; Vidya said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sudhish said. &ldquo;I am not Sudhish. Sudhish is a fa&hellip;. no. Somehow, I must become Geeta, and it must begin now. Do not speak my male name again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both his sisters nodded, their eyes full of emotion as they watched him struggle with these deep and powerful forces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geeta&rsquo;s right. She needs help,&rdquo; Rani said, sending all the love and energy she could into her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since Geeta requires a man, then perhaps we should provide her with a man,&rdquo; Emma said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will we do that?&rdquo; Vidya asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will become Martin a little ahead of schedule,&rdquo; Emma said, walking towards the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of the experiment?&rdquo; Rani protested. &ldquo;Will such a change not ruin the planned experiment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will understand why we have changed plans,&rdquo; Emma said patiently. &ldquo;Perhaps the data from our bellies has already suggested to them our difficulties. In any event, we can explain ourselves later, if we are successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; Sudhish asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, Sudhish, you must go to the huts, and do not return, no matter what you may hear. I may shout and scream, but there will be nothing happening, your sisters will be safe. I am going to trick myself into battle. Do you understand?&rdquo; She asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, respect growing in his face as he understood what Emma hoped to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am successful, we&rsquo;ll call you back,&rdquo; Emma finished.</p>
<p>Sudhish looked at his sisters, seeking and finding their approval for this plan. He nodded, and turned from the pool and hoisted himself out. He took a step towards the path, stopped, and turned back to the pool, his brown, healthy, and entirely-too-male-body dripping water on the rocks under him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will pray for your success,&rdquo; he said, and headed down the path.</p>
<p>Emma looked down at the food that was to have been eaten by the time Sudhish had made his transition and his sisters had formed their initial bond. From two hours of eating to two minutes; how she would be able to eat half of it in twenty minutes, she wondered? She sat down beside the food and started to eat. After a few minutes she, slowed. She felt sick, and she instantly realized that this was the wrong way to feel. Anger flared in her heart. She would not be the victim of this circumstance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rani, Vidya, first of all, I want you to call me Martin,&rdquo; she said as they nodded. &ldquo;Second, I want you to ferry this food to me in the pool,&rdquo; she said, stepping down into the water. &ldquo;Just feed it to me as I ask for it. I&rsquo;m going to be gaining a lot of mass, or so I hope, and I&rsquo;m too small to eat as much as I think I&rsquo;ll need in such a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both moved over to the edge of the pool by the pile of food, their young, fully restored bodies glistening in the water. Emma looked them both over, trying to imagine herself a male, gazing at his mates. Vidya was all innocence, with enormous round eyes, a long elegant face, a small mouth with full lips. Her body was slender, and her long limbs gave her a coltish air. Rani was the sensible middle sister, her strong chin and placid brown eyes framed by her light brown hair. Her body was round and mature compared to Vidya&rsquo;s leaner lines. They were both beautiful, Emma thought, and they looked so fragile, so innocent looking now that they were healthy again.</p>
<p>Emma closed her eyes and imagined herself towering over Malaki, rescuing these girls from his evil embrace. She saw, in her mind&rsquo;s eye, Malaki in his hut on the beach, but he wasn&rsquo;t tied up! No, he was crouched down, waiting for someone to come feed him, and he held a gun in his hand! She opened her eyes, shocked at the clarity of the vision she just saw, blinking in the sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food?&rdquo; Rani asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Emma said, a hardness creeping into her voice.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes again, and this time saw Malaki stalking Vidya in the jungle, closing in on her as she gathered fruit with her sister. Adrenaline surged through her slender body, and Emma pounded the water, battling with the imaginary Malaki. The surprising ferocity of Emma&rsquo;s outburst caused both Rani and Vidya to freeze. They watched as Emma slashed, bashed, and stabbed her enemy, water spraying everywhere.</p>
<p>Again and again she advanced on Malaki, on the beach, in the jungle, in the water, at the huts, even here, in the pool! She threw herself from side to side, tackling Malaki&rsquo;s imaginary ankles, pressing her knees into his back, and grinding his face into the dirt. As her muscles began to sting, she felt it start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessss!&rdquo; she cried victoriously, the tickle racing along her spine up to her skull.</p>
<p>He renewed his attack, ripping Malaki&rsquo;s limbs off, kicking his body across the beach, ready to defend his mates regardless of the cost. He took the battle underwater, wrestling with rocks on the bottom, seeing Malaki&rsquo;s face on each one.</p>
<p>The bubbles exploded around him, but he refused to &ldquo;give in&rdquo; to the change, seeking the pocket of the transformational forces, the curl of the mighty wave of change wherein he could ride it out, sliding towards the face of the wave or back towards the roiling water. He lifted his face from the water, like a creature from the black lagoon, microorganisms making his face look like it was bubbling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food!&rdquo; he bellowed, his voice deepening as he spoke.</p>
<p>The girls rushed forward with their food, and Martin grabbed most of it quickly and stuffed it into his mouth, swallowing without chewing, half of it falling into the roiling water. He caught their eyes and saw both fear and awe; he focused on their awe. The imaginary wave lifted over him, and he dropped back into the water, easing his way back along the channel towards the sweet spot that lay between rocks of pain and the wave&rsquo;s transforming power.</p>
<p>The girls watched in fascination as the bubbles roiled around their future mate, &ldquo;eating&rdquo; the food floating in the water. Rani had a sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dump all of it on him,&rdquo; she said, making a trip back to the pile and literally throwing the food at the boiling water. &ldquo;The microorganisms will use it as they help change him. They need biomass to add to his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls started ferrying handfuls of food to the center of the pool. Martin noticed the occasional bits of fish and greens floating near him and immediately guessed at what the girls were doing. Smart girls. He grabbed a large piece of disappearing fish and ate it&ndash;microorganisms and all! He trusted the little buggers would sort it all out in his gut. He rose for more air and more food, and sank back into the whirlpool of bubbles.</p>
<p>He felt stretched and his body ached, but there were no sharp pains, nothing that seemed to break. He could feel his body changing, but because nearly everything was getting bigger, literally, the changes didn&rsquo;t feel like an attack on his body. He never even noticed his breasts disappearing. But he noticed the growing feeling of stiffness between his legs as his sexual organs descended and realigned themselves in a new configuration.</p>
<p>The bubbles were beginning to slacken, and there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any more food left in the water. The microorganisms had consumed and apparently transformed every morsel. He stood up.</p>
<p>Rani and Vidya gasped. Martin was taller than they expected. Emma had only been a little over five foot four inches tall (160 cm), but Martin appeared to be just over six feet tall (183 cm). He had broad shoulders, narrow hips, big hands, dark brown hair, blue eyes, and a face chiseled from granite. He looked a little gaunt, but the mers had warned them that was to be expected. Over the next few days he would put on weight quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, enjoying their look of unabashed admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geeta!&rdquo; Vidya shouted. &ldquo;It worked, it worked! Geeta, come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin looked himself over, running his hands down his ripped abdomen to his new penis. It felt alien, like an extra limb, but it didn&rsquo;t feel bad. He smiled, feeling it awaken as he watched Vidya&rsquo;s slender back as she bent over, looking for her brother to emerge from the jungle. He glanced over at Rani who still stood open mouthed, her eyes wide, staring at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my lady,&rdquo; he said, walking towards her. &ldquo;For the gift of food. I believe your quick thinking may have helped quite a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; she squeaked, looking up at him, her heart pounding.</p>
<p>He slowly placed his strong arm around her shoulders and reached down to kiss her. Rani lifted her chin and opened her lips to welcome him. She swooned as his lips touched hers, her knees wobbling. He lifted her up in a hug, and that was the first thing Sudhish noticed as he ran up the path towards the pool.</p>
<p>Sudhish stopped short, caught by the sudden urge to protect his sister. He quickly swallowed that emotion, both because he was pledged to become a sister-wife himself and because he realized that Martin had thirty pounds and a few inches advantage. He looked at Vidya and saw her happy innocent smile. He smiled back at her. She seemed genuinely happy that he was about to join her both in sisterhood and in a bond stronger than any human vow. He resolved to keep her smile on his sister&rsquo;s face. He saw Rani turn and notice his arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geeta!&rdquo; she said, welcoming her soon-to-be-sister-wife. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he gorgeous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kept his thoughts to himself, and focused on unclenching his fists. Martin noticed his action, but said nothing. Sudhish walked to the pool, keeping the raging forces tightly controlled in his own body. He tried to keep his face expressionless, but he felt the heat of anger rise along his neck. He looked down at his younger sister, manufacturing another smile for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you angry?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he lied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to be a good brother,&rdquo; Martin said, his rich baritone voice ringing out. &ldquo;I think I know how you feel. Do you still want to go through with this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudhish hesitated, the brief struggle visible on his face. He shook it off, set his jaw, and stepped forward and into the pool. He walked erect until he stood next to Martin. Vidya had come up behind him while Rani stood at his side. He looked Martin in eye, and then saw a glint of compassion behind the steely-eyed strength that the new man projected. He really was offering Sudhish a choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Do what I can not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin looked at him and remembered the beauty that had been his sister. He fixed the image in his mind, and brought Sudhish into a hug. Sudhish remained stiff and unyielding, but Martin glanced at the other two women who wordlessly backed away at his non-verbal command. Then, without warning, he wrenched Sudhish from his feet and plunged them both into the water.</p>
<p>Panic surged through Sudhish and he struggled against Martin&rsquo;s embrace, but the bigger man was too strong, and Sudhish felt the tingle along his spine rise up and burst, like a tiny firework, in his skull.</p>
<p>Geeta stopped struggling as bubbles violently erupted around her. Martin loosened his grip, and guided her face towards the surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my gosh,&rdquo; Vidya said. &ldquo;Those bubbles seem stronger than before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their life cycle depends on someone changing, and so they get more numerous with each change,&rdquo; Rani said, remembering some of what Pat had explained on the beach. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give more focus to Geeta. Martin might not remember how she looked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone remembered how Geeta looked,&rdquo; Vidya said without malice. &ldquo;She was always the most beautiful woman in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They joined Martin at Geeta&rsquo;s side, each taking a leg and an arm while Martin remained at her head. They watched as the water foamed around her, her body twisting, turning, morphing, shrinking, and changing into a near duplicate of their deceased sister. They caught glimpses of her legs shrinking, her hips expanding, her waist and shoulders narrowing, her neck lengthening, and her hair growing. After many minutes, the water calmed down, and they could see the new Geeta clearly for the first time.</p>
<p>Martin gently lifted her head up from the water, and she put her feet under her and stood up. She was the tallest sister now, but she was still a good deal shorter than Martin. Her dark brown hair fell in thick, wet curls over her shoulders, down her back, and over her breasts. Her face was now a beautiful oval with wide set, deep mysterious eyes flashing with flecks of gold and brown. Her face would never be considered innocent. Her shoulders were strong but feminine, and her waist seemed impossibly small, especially when compared to her generous hips. Her breasts were only slightly smaller than Rani&rsquo;s, but the overall effect was astounding.</p>
<p>Geeta looked at each of her new pod-mates as they gazed at her, feeling their emotions with her new proto-mer senses. She grew uncomfortable as they stared, and she slowly began to understand both the joy and the frustration her sister must have felt. She felt admiration, desire, and even lust from all three of them, and at the same time she clearly felt her sister&rsquo;s feelings of inadequacy and jealousy.</p>
<p>The latter feelings she would never tolerate, not after everything that she had just been through. She grabbed her sister&rsquo;s hands and held them fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have proto-mer senses now, and I don&rsquo;t ever want to feel those feelings coming from you ever again!&rdquo; she said, shaking their hands to emphasize her point. &ldquo;Look within yourselves to find the true beauty in the world, and remember I love you both more than I love myself. You are both equally as beautiful as I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She forced them both to look at her eyes, and waited until she saw a pact, an agreement of principle in their eyes. She turned to Martin, feeling a new strength she never quite understood before flow from his gaze and into her heart. She smiled, not knowing that her smile had quite literally become a devastating weapon of mass, emotional upheaval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please show Vidya how beautiful she is while I kiss some sense into Rani?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Martin blinked, nearly overwhelmed by this radiant and sexual creature who stood before him. Only moments ago, he had been the potential object of male lust, but now his own libido exploded as her smile washed over him. His cock instantly sprang to life, and when Vidya gasped, he knew she thought it was because of her. He wisely chose not to correct her.</p>
<p>He shifted his gaze to Vidya, and was reassured when his new appendage stiffened further, both because Vidya was herself beautiful and she was looking at him with unabashed wonder. He felt like a rock star. He looked back over to Rani and Geeta, the former also looking at him with undisguised admiration, but Geeta was looking at him with mischief in her amazing eyes. He briefly toyed with the notion of pointing out that up until a few moments ago, he was the one who was making the decisions for the pod. But when Geeta mouthed &ldquo;please&rdquo; without speaking, her eyes fluttering and her wide, sensuous mouth blowing a kiss in his direction, the thought evaporated.</p>
<p>Well, he used to be a woman, he thought, and he wondered how Geeta learned that particular trick so quickly. He reached out to Vidya and brought his new pod-mate into an embrace and kissed her. Like her older sister, Vidya too swooned, her legs buckling beneath her.</p>
<p>Geeta, smiled, feeling the power of her new body as the sexual tension in the pool blossomed fully. Her heart and mind were finally in agreement and a sense of peace rose alongside the rising passion. She turned her towards Rani&ndash;the sensible one&ndash;and projected as much love and desire as she could. Rani&rsquo;s eyes widened as she felt the unspoken force of this gorgeous creature showering her with love, Geeta&rsquo;s eyes a fountain of desire and love. Rani took a step back, nearly overcome with emotion.</p>
<p>Geeta stepped closer to Rani and put a hand on her sister-wife&rsquo;s shoulder, turning her so they faced one another. Geeta saw that she was an few centimeters taller, but that Rani&rsquo;s figure was fuller, rounder, and softer than her own. She gathered Rani into her arms, determined to purge the look of awe from her sister&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your eyes always said exactly what was in your heart, no matter what you wanted to hold back,&rdquo; she said, kissing each one as she spoke. &ldquo;But I want you to close your eyes, and see with your mer-senses what I see as I kiss you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rani kept each eye closed after the butterfly light kisses had left her eyelids, and she cooed as the soft, gentle kisses moved over her face, her ears, her neck, and down along her breasts. She tried to hold still as Geeta&rsquo;s tongue flicked every so lightly across her nipples, kisses continuing down across her belly, around her navel, and then to where the water rippled across her wide hips. Geeta traced her way back up her sister&rsquo;s body, sending all the love and warmth she could into each kiss. By the time she returned to her sister&rsquo;s lips, Rani was no longer awed or cowed by her sister&rsquo;s beauty, she was going to devour it.</p>
<p>Geeta thrilled to the force with which Rani returned her kisses, and for several minutes they kissed and nibbled on each other, pressing their bodies together, listening to their youngest sister moan and pant as Martin expertly seduced her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe what I&rsquo;m feeling,&rdquo; Rani said, panting. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my sister, my wife, my lover, my brother &hellip; you&rsquo;re amazing, and I want you so badly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about it, show me,&rdquo; Geeta said, kissing her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; Rani growled, pushing Geeta back towards the rocky wall along the outward facing edge of the pool.</p>
<p>She took control, and Geeta let her, secure in knowing that she was a little stronger than either of her sisters, but relishing the ardent fervor she felt coming from Rani. Rani buried her face in Geeta&rsquo;s breasts, lavishing kisses and licks along her sternum, under each breast, up along the areolas, forcefully sucking on her nipples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh &hellip; oh &hellip; yesssss,&rdquo; Geeta hissed, her breasts tingling under the onslaught.</p>
<p>Rani pushed Geeta&rsquo;s hips until they rested against the wall, and then she urged her sister-wife to sit up on the smooth surface of the sunwarmed rocks. Rani then ran her hands down her torso, over her hips, down her legs to her knees and spread her sister&rsquo;s legs apart, exposing her new sex to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; she breathed, and she sank to her knees in the pool and kissed Geeta&rsquo;s vagina like a starving woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohhhhhhh,&rdquo; she cried as her sex was touched for the first time.</p>
<p>Geeta looked down into Rani&rsquo;s eyes as her sister-wife began to passionately kiss, lick, and caress her most intimate of places. Each nibble and lick sent her further and further into a spiral of pleasure, threatening to throw her from the wall and into the jungle below. A sudden movement caught her eye, and she watched as Martin stood in the center of the pool, lifting Vidya&rsquo;s slender body by her hips, her legs draped over his arms, and then lowered her onto his cock. Vidya wrapped her legs around his back as he began stroking her up and down his long cock.</p>
<p>Rani sucked her clitoris into her mouth, and Geeta pushed her pelvis towards Rani. She wrapped her own legs around her sister&rsquo;s shoulders and lay back on the wall, her breasts pointing at the sky as she rolled her hips up and down, Rani&rsquo;s lips firmly capturing her stiff little button. Her orgasm burst in her womb like a bomb, the shock wave rippling outward from her crotch. She clutched at the wall, trying to make the earth steady, but Rani refused to let up, and a second explosion rocked her body. Geeta cried out as a third build up rose in her and then detonated across her hips.</p>
<p>She felt something warm flickering over her face and body and wondered if it started raining. No, she thought as Rani kissed and caressed her body as the aftershocks rolled across her, the sun was shining. She looked down her body and saw the fine streams of milk arcing from her own nipples like twin fountains. Mermaid milk, she thought. Soon, they would be mermaids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does your mer-senses tell you now?&rdquo; Rani asked.</p>
<p>Geeta wrapped her legs around Rani&rsquo;s hips as she sank into the water next to her sister-wife, kissing her softly and gently on her forehead, nose, and then lips as she slid down from the wall. She leaned back and looked into Rani&rsquo;s soft, brown eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love me,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;And I love you, so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they kissed again, both girls snaked a hand into the other&rsquo;s vagina and quickly and effortlessly brought each other to several satisfying orgasms. As they savored their growing bonds, they watched Vidya shudder and scream through a tenth or eleventh amazing orgasm, while Martin worked to keep them both upright. When his own orgasm erupted, his first one as a male, he finally lost his footing. Geeta and Rani rushed over to keep both their heads in the air, since Vidya refused to release her legs that were clamped around his arms and torso.</p>
<p>When they had all recovered, they shared a group kiss, their limbs intertwined as they relaxed in the water, watching the sun continue its journey across the afternoon sky.</p>
<p>Jackson Baker looked over the seven other people assembled in his kitchen, watching six of them digest the long list of conditions and promises he had just outlined. Some in the group were eager to agree to their terms, others were being more thoughtful. Kyle&rsquo;s face was typically impassive, the late afternoon sun casting deep shadows across his wrinkles. He&rsquo;d make the world&rsquo;s best poker player, Jack thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you need an answer right now?&rdquo; asked Carl Thomas, a retired marine biologist and Jack&rsquo;s former colleague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so. Either you say yes today, and your life will never be the same, or you say no, and Kyle here takes you back to the mainland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Uncle Kyle,&rdquo; began Angela Johnson, a young woman in her late twenties. &ldquo;Let me see if I have this right. If we say yes, we will be changed somehow, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Kyle said. &ldquo;For the better, I&rsquo;m saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you say,&rdquo; Angela said. &ldquo;But because we will be different, we can never return to human civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Kyle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand, we will appear to be about twenty-five, we&rsquo;ll live for a really long time, we will gain new physical and mental abilities, which could give us a real chance to save the whales,&rdquo; said Angela ticking off on her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good list,&rdquo; Kyle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d love to save the whales, but you had me at &lsquo;never return to human civilization,'&rdquo; said Angela forcefully. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of times I&rsquo;ve wanted to escape from all the bullshit and the sick, twisted &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Angie,&rdquo; Kyle interrupted. &ldquo;I know your father, my brother, and I&rsquo;m sorry for you. I can&rsquo;t fix what he done to you, but I can give you a second chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m sorry Uncle Kyle,&quot; she said, bowing her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d think ten years of therapy would help, but &hellip; anyway, you were always the biggest help to me, and I &hellip; I &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think about it again,&rdquo; Kyle said. &ldquo;I just did what I could, nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, well, I&rsquo;m in, all in,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too, for the same, fucking reasons,&rdquo; said Belle Lanham, Angela&rsquo;s best friend.</p>
<p>A few moments passed as the others mulled over their options. Dr. Carl Thomas had retired from teaching biology at Washington College. Like Jackson, he was in his sixties, single, and with relatively few ties to the world. Unlike Jackson, he wasn&rsquo;t wealthy, but he was one of the few people who had seen Jackson&rsquo;s hidden aquarium. Annie Baker, Jack&rsquo;s cousin, also shared that experience. She was a handsome woman in her late fifties, and she recently retired from teaching music in the public schools. Like her cousin, she shared a lifelong passion for the sea and its creatures. Unlike her cousin, she had few opportunities to indulge that passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; Annie said. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t want to clean the house this weekend anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sasha Johanson and Sara Abrams, who were old friends with both Annie and Kyle, looked at each other, and then at Kyle. They nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in, too,&rdquo; Carl said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;Now, does anyone need to say goodbye to anyone or tidy up any business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as we didn&rsquo;t need to pack an extra set of clothes,&rdquo; Angela joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need any clothes,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t be naked, exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t need to say a fucking goodbye to anyone,&rdquo; said Angela looking around the room as others also nodded their heads in agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you prepared us enough that our disappearances won&rsquo;t cause much trouble, at least not for a while,&rdquo; Carl said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then &hellip; it&rsquo;s time for the rest of the story,&rdquo; Jackson said, rising from his kitchen table. &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the group down into the basement and opened the secret door, which caused a few gasps and oohs and aahs. They proceeded down the passageway into the main viewing room for the huge tank. Once everyone was in the room, Jack punched a few keys on the control panel, closing the blast doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so we don&rsquo;t run screaming?&rdquo; Amanda joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s so no one disturbs us,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;Watch the tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone turned and looked at the large, brightly lit tank. Thousands of fish swam in the water, some making slow circles around the perimeter, others darting back and forth among the coral, rocks, and plants that peppered the artificial landscape. After several moments passed, a cuttlefish darted to the center of the tank, snagged a small fish, and disappeared back into the rocks from which it had sprung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you wanted to show us?&rdquo; Sasha asked. &ldquo;An octopus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson smiled, and shook his head. Sasha, Sara, and Annie were all old friends and excellent musicians. Sadly, Sasha and Sara didn&rsquo;t share his cousin&rsquo;s knowledge of and passion for sea creatures. However, between the three of them, there wasn&rsquo;t an instrument they couldn&rsquo;t play, and most of them they could play very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cuttlefish,&rdquo; Jackson patiently. &ldquo;Look carefully. Do you see others hiding among the coral and rocks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other cuttlefish?&rdquo; Sara asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jackson said, trying not to smile.</p>
<p>They all walked up to the tank, and some even put their hands on the glass as they searched the tank. Jackson and Kyle hung back, waiting. After a few moments, four long brown tails snapped into view, right in front of the glass. Everyone jumped back and Sara and Sasha screamed with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the fu &hellip;&rdquo; Angela started, but the sight before her froze her tongue.</p>
<p>Mac, Joy, Annette, and Bonnie hung gracefully in the water, one hand stretched over their heads, clinging to the top of the tank wall. Their long hair floated about them like lace, and their long tails gently moved back and forth, making it clear that these were not fake mermaids at all. Several seconds passed and no human moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re &hellip; they&rsquo;re &hellip;&rdquo; Carl stuttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fucking beautiful!&rdquo; Angela said. &ldquo;Is THIS what we are going to change into?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jackson said, no longer hiding his glee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fucking AWESOME,&rdquo; said Angela pulling up her sleeve on her shirt. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already fucking got one here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She brandished a tattoo of a mermaid that looked very much like the ones in the tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; said Belle pulling up her own sleeve.</p>
<p>They turned back to the tank, staring at the four mers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are beautiful,&rdquo; Carl said, his heart pounding in his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, amazing,&rdquo; Sasha said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they do that?&rdquo; Carl asked.</p>
<p>Jack nodded at Mac. The mers all retracted their hands from the air, and winked out of view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy, fucking shit!&rdquo; Angela said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angie &hellip; language,&rdquo; Kyle said gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuck, sorry,&rdquo; Angela said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll explain as we go,&rdquo; Jackson said, giving another signal.</p>
<p>The mers reappeared at the top of the tank, smiling down at everyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a hole,&rdquo; Mac bellowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone move over there,&rdquo; Joy said pointing, even as her mate ducked back under, disappearing, and then bursting forth from the water seconds later, somersaulting over the wall onto the floor in front of Kyle, water splashing everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best get used to water!&rdquo; Mac said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be a long night,&rdquo; Joy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, two of you will share one breast per mermaid now, and then two different people later tonight, and then two other people tomorrow morning,&rdquo; Joy explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, that&rsquo;s only seven of eight people feeding,&rdquo; Sara said. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to get left behind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac?&rdquo; asked Sara. &ldquo;How does anyone feed from a merman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; Angela said, laughing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angie &hellip;&rdquo; Kyle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Siren cells are in his semen,&rdquo; Angela said. &ldquo;You just have to &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we all understand the basics,&rdquo; Carl interrupted. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re going to need to sort out how we&rsquo;re going to do this. I count three men and five women, and if I&rsquo;ve understood everything so far, we need two men and six women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have correctly assessed the situation,&rdquo; Joy agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew this?&rdquo; asked Carl turning to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it? Just yep?&rdquo; Carl demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; said Jack giving his old friend a long look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is awkward,&rdquo; Angela said, fussing with her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, Carl,&rdquo; Kyle urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Aw, Carl?&rdquo; Carl demanded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on his side now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying,&rdquo; Kyle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; Carl asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not saying,&rdquo; Kyle said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I not saying?&rdquo; Carl demanded. &ldquo;God, you&rsquo;ve never said this many words in a row to me in your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that you&rsquo;re &hellip;&rdquo; Kyle said, his neck reddening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, that I&rsquo;m gay?&rdquo; Carl said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got to do with anything? Being gay means I like men, not that I want to be a woman or a mermaid myself. How long have you known me, Kyle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, and in that long time have you ever heard me talking about becoming a woman?&rdquo; Carl asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Kyle answered, embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. Exactly zero times,&rdquo; Carl said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Kyle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s your excuse?&rdquo; asked Carl turning to Jack again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got none,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;I knew you liked me, and well, you being a mermaid was the only way I was going to like you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Carl surprised. &ldquo;You want me to be your mermaid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Jackson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, shit,&rdquo; Carl said.</p>
<p>Angela and Belle giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Carl said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re cute when you swear,&rdquo; Belle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Carl said. &ldquo;So, everyone planned this out without telling me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Jackson said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, everything seems so neat and tidy except for me,&rdquo; Carl complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Jackson asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got three girls who are all musicians, one of whom is your cousin,&rdquo; said Carl nodding at Jackson. &ldquo;They go with Kyle, because we want to avoid incest and despite being an very ornery oysterman, he can sing like a dream. So, that keeps things nice and tidy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that brings us to Angela and Belle &hellip;&rdquo; started Carl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late to avoid incest,&rdquo; Angela said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes &hellip; I caught that. Sorry about &hellip;&rdquo; Carl stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget about it,&rdquo; Angela said. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they are both Greenpeace activists, and Angela, if I remember correctly, studied marine biology at UM Eastern Shore,&rdquo; Carl continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember correctly,&rdquo; Angela confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make a wild guess and say Belle studied something similar,&rdquo; Carl continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ecology, never finished,&rdquo; Belle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. And I taught biology for nearly forty years,&rdquo; said Carl giving &lsquo;the look&rsquo; at Jackson. &ldquo;So, obviously the three of us go with you, with you being the merman. Now, you can&rsquo;t tell me you didn&rsquo;t think about all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought did cross my mind,&rdquo; Jack said, smiling a tiny bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you think I&rsquo;d agree to this?&rdquo; Carl asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freshman year,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; Carl protested. &ldquo;I was drunk. Hell, I was plastered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who said it,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. Just fine,&rdquo; said Carl crossing his arms and pouting.</p>
<p>Several seconds passed in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you fucking say?&rdquo; Angela asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him if he would kiss me if I was a woman,&rdquo; Carl confessed.</p>
<p>Angela looked back and forth between the two men, clearly enjoying the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you tell him?&rdquo; Angela asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Jackson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look down,&rdquo; said Joy softly. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But &hellip;&rdquo; Mac whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to explain to me why you&rsquo;re happy to let another woman suck your cock?&rdquo; asked Joy arching an eyebrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. It&rsquo;s just &hellip; I don&rsquo;t &hellip; Goddamnit,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s sort of like his request for a last meal,&rdquo; Joy said, smiling. &ldquo;He really likes men, and you are a really, manly man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flatterer,&rdquo; Mac said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit stalling and get going,&rdquo; Joy said, shooing him towards Carl.</p>
<p>Mac sighed and salamandered away, carefully picking his way among the mers and humans sprawled out over the floor of the viewing room. When he reached Carl, he flipped over and sat down, his long tail slapping on the cement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, have at it,&rdquo; Mac said, leaning up against a wall.</p>
<p>Carl looked over the recumbent merman, searching for some clue as to where his penis might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, I don&rsquo;t seem to know where to begin,&rdquo; Carl said, embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, right. Sorry,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in here, but I have to &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mac furrowed his brow, trying to get his vent to open. He could get the slit to appear, a tiny crack in his scales opening about fifteen centimeters below his belly button, but he couldn&rsquo;t get his penis aroused. He looked over at Joy and saw that she had both Jackson and Angela, one on each breast. He felt a pang of jealousy, which didn&rsquo;t help matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a second,&rdquo; he said, closing his eyes.</p>
<p>He remembered back to when Joy and he made love on the airplane to Hong Kong, in that fancy little room on the enormous plane. She had been insatiable, and their slowly youthening bodies had provided them with hours of pleasure. That was a great day. Later, in the hotel, she gave him that amazing blow job in the shower. Yeah, one that felt a lot like the one he was getting now.</p>
<p>It worked, but Mac decided not to open his eyes. After only a few seconds more, however, he was ready to admit that Carl certainly knew what he was doing. In a very short time, Carl had successfully earned his first feeding, and Mac returned to the tank to renew his bonds with his girls.</p>
<p>Carl hadn&rsquo;t noticed anything unusual until Jack had sat down next to him and put his arm around his shoulders. A tingle in his spine rose up to his skull and pricked his brain with a tiny explosion. It was over in a flash, and Carl laid his head on Jack&rsquo;s shoulder. He watched as Angela and Belle came over and sat down on Jack&rsquo;s other side. The four of them sat together for many minutes, watching the light show in the tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That mermaid milk is amazing,&rdquo; Angela said, her voice softer and richer than it had been before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like all the anger and pain just flowed right out of me,&rdquo; said Angela her voice tinged with awe. &ldquo;Fucking so much better than fucking therapy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Belle agreed. &ldquo;Fucking therapy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a good thing,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>A few more moments passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belle, do your tats hurt?&rdquo; Angela asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, what&rsquo;s that about?&rdquo; Belle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are tats?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tattoos,&rdquo; Angela said. &ldquo;Man, you are so old school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tattoos. Well, the siren cells are healing your body and your mind,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;The tats will probably be gone by morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bummer,&rdquo; Angela said. &ldquo;I liked those tats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few more moments passed, the light show in the tank showing that Mac had changed partners again. Each of the humans were lost in their own thoughts, wondering what it would be like to actually be mers, to be making love with as much passion, energy, and stamina as the mers in the tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cassie,&rdquo; Carl said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you can call me later,&rdquo; Carl said. &ldquo;Cassie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>Angela started humming, and a few seconds later, Carl laughed out loud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Jack asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A, B, C,&rdquo; Carl sang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy as 1, 2, 3,&rdquo; Angela sang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or simple as do re mi,&rdquo; Belle sang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, baby, you and me girl!&rdquo; they all sang together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much time left?&rdquo; Pat asked, looking up from her screen, casting a critical eye around the lab cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes,&rdquo; Phoebe said, her own head buried behind a computer screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jaclyn, have you got everything you need?&rdquo; Pat asked, looking across the low metal table at her former Greenpeace friend and activist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Jaclyn said with a mock salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very funny,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;This is serious. It could be deadly serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to do fine,&rdquo; Jaclyn said. &ldquo;They will believe you, and we will be left alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If wishes were horses,&rdquo; Pat said, returning to her computer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please let me fix your hair?&rdquo; Danni asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only if you can do it while I work,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>Danni smiled at John, handing him Freya, and kicked herself out of the pool onto the cave floor. She reached behind her back and pulled a comb and a crown of brightly colored tiare, hibiscus, and frangipani blossoms. She salamandered over to her sister-wife, set the crown on the floor, and carefully combed and braided Pat&rsquo;s temples, and then pulled the thin braids back behind her ears and then joined them in a long, single braid that went down along her dorsal ridge. As Pat continued reading her notes on the computer screen, Danni carefully positioned the crown of flowers so that it covered Pat&rsquo;s silvery headband. She pulled a few strands of hair forward from behind her ears, and then arranged Pat&rsquo;s thick, flowing tresses over her shoulders and breasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you done yet?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost. Hold still,&rdquo; Danni said. She wet her thumb and smoothed out each of Pat&rsquo;s eyebrows, and then pinched each of her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch! Is that really necessary?&rdquo; Pat complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on Candid Camera!&rdquo; Danni teased. &ldquo;You have to look ravishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She always looks ravishing,&rdquo; said Phoebe positioning her own crown of flowers in her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, you&rsquo;re finished,&rdquo; Danni said. &ldquo;I love you, and I&rsquo;m proud to be your pod-mate. Now, knock em dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You metaphor could use some work, but your sentiment is most appreciated,&rdquo; said Pat turning away from her screen and kissing Danni. &ldquo;I love you too. Now, you watch the kids, and I&rsquo;ll talk to the stuffed shirts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danni salamandered over to Phoebe, gave her a kiss too, and then rejoined John in the pool. Pat surveyed the room again. Galina and Alexis wore their crowns over their headbands and were positioned at the table directly behind the one where Pat perched. Phoebe was at the table to Pat&rsquo;s left. The place was clean, organized, and looked like a modern facility. She hoped it would be convincing.</p>
<p>She reached up and touched the flowers on her head. It was a nice touch. Not only did it reinforce an idyllic, peace-loving image but also it hid their headbands. Despite the relatively low quality of the video connection, they didn&rsquo;t want anyone to see the pattern Rose had created that seemed to be the major factor in enhancing and extending their mer senses. Hopefully, they could keep that a secret. She almost regretted sending the headbands to Taylor&rsquo;s Island, but it was too late. They would arrive within the next few hours, probably not long after this polycom conference.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and centered her thoughts. Focus on the science, the carrots, as Bart advised, and use purposefully vague language about The Device. Do not, under any circumstances, divulge how it worked or might be unleashed. Agreements, signatures, and treaties first, and then details on The Device later. No problem, right?</p>
<p>Her stomach flipped as she thought, for a moment, about what would happen if the damn thing ever went off. It would be the end of nearly every living thing on the planet, and they had created it. She looked at Galina and Alexis, both looking so innocent, so beautiful, as they made their final preparations for the conference. They invented it, she thought.</p>
<p>No, Pat reminded herself that she had agreed with them and with both John and Gabriel&rsquo;s passionate arguments in support of a meaningful weapon. I am equally responsible for all this, she reminded herself. She hoped that John and Gabriel&rsquo;s arguments hadn&rsquo;t been grounded too deeply in an irrational, testosterone-laden aggression. Heavens, this was going to be harder than she thought.</p>
<p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t just that argument, she had to admit to herself. She also felt that deep, almost irrational need to protect too. She felt it every time she picked up Maureen, every time her sweet little daughter suckled at her breast, every time she heard the silvery laughter her daughter seemed prone to sharing, and every time she watched all her children play together. She knew how most people feared what they did not know or understand, and she was determined that prejudice and hate would have to fight their way through her own body before they harmed her pod.</p>
<p>She set her chin and launched Skype, watching the icon bounce on her toolbar. After a few seconds, she saw that Bart was online and clicked on his name. The window opened up, and his face popped into view. He was wearing a suit and tie and his hair was neatly combed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like a businessman,&rdquo; said Pat in greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like a politician,&rdquo; Bart said. &ldquo;You look like an island queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. I feel like a bug about to hit a windshield,&rdquo; Pat admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that your windshield is bigger and badder than their windshield,&rdquo; said Bart reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That only works if they see it in time, and veer away from it,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;Otherwise, we all smash into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ready?&rdquo; asked Bart looking at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Jack &hellip; pick up the call,&rdquo; Pat muttered, watching the screen. God, that had been an excruciating hour, she thought. Where was Jack?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m back,&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s face appeared on the screen. &ldquo;Sorry, something kicked me off. Let&rsquo;s be very clear and precise in what we say, just in case, alright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re bugged?&rdquo; asked Pat warily?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;We usually don&rsquo;t say that out loud, but instead we are carefully clear and precise.&rdquo; He gave the camera a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, right,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Lurch used to say; you rang?&rdquo; said Jack trying to keep it light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sorry,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;I just wanted to know what you and the gang thought about how it went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, on a scale of one to ten, a five,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;The gang?&rdquo; He looked over his shoulder and then turned back to the camera. &ldquo;Fours and fives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat looked at Jack carefully, trying to read his face. Oh my god, she realized. He&rsquo;s younger! He&rsquo;s drinking mermaid milk. No wonder he wants to be careful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bad?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was more bad than good,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Pat said, feeling much the same way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should talk later,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll contact you in twelve hours, is that alright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;Talk to you then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bye,&rdquo; Jack said. He gave another look at the camera and terminated the call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you upset about?&rdquo; Phoebe asked. &ldquo;I thought it went well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Mr. Baker was being most generous,&rdquo; Galina said, taking off her crown of flowers. &ldquo;I would give it a three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why a three?&rdquo; Phoebe asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confused. We just spent an hour talking to scientists, generals, and politicians from Russia, the United States, and China. They were all very respectful, and they really liked some of the inventions. Taiping Su was very excited about his sea anemones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phoebe,&rdquo; Pat sighed. &ldquo;Nearly everyone on that call was wavering between terror and disbelief. Couldn&rsquo;t you hear it in their voices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Phoebe said. &ldquo;I thought that Anatoly guy believed everything you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Da,&rdquo; Galina agreed. &ldquo;But he was the only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; Phoebe asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Da,&rdquo; Galina said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you think?&rdquo; Bart asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn, those were some seriously beautiful mamacitas,&rdquo; Lucia said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not the mermaids, the others. What was your impression of them, of how they received the information?&rdquo; Bart pressed.</p>
<p>Lucia pursed her lips and thought. She looked into her boss&rsquo; face, searching for some clue as to how she should respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like, you really wanna know what this chavala thinks about all those gabachos, eh?&rdquo; Lucia asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you can tone down the street speak,&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we better have a whole lotta money,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Otherwise, we gonna be in jail for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think that?&rdquo; Bart asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That general guy, the one that got so mad at Mac the Merman, you know which one?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, General David Stottomeyer. What about him?&rdquo; Bart prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t sound like he was gonna let any cute, little mermaid on some ain&rsquo;t-no-body-knows-where-it-is-atoll tell him what he can and he can&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He was Mr. Unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I have a feeling he was behind the raid on Taylor&rsquo;s Island,&rdquo; Bart agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatcho gonna do?&rdquo; Lucia asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, yet,&rdquo; Bart admitted. &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn, always so proper, correcting my grammar and shit,&rdquo; Lucia teased, an old game between them. &ldquo;I do not know what I will do myself, either, Mr. Kolbert, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to take a trip to Mermaid Island?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?! Are you shitting me?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;m serious,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go be no mermaid,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I got things to do, family and shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not suggesting you go and become a mermaid, not unless you want to,&rdquo; he said, calming her. &ldquo;I was thinking it would be a good time for you to take a vacation. Get away from the cold city, go someplace warm. It could get dicey around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is exactly why I&rsquo;m not going a n y w h e r e!&rdquo; she said, rising out of her chair. &ldquo;Someone has got to be here to bail your ass out of jail and shit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your confidence in my professional judgement and your compassion for my well-being overwhelm me,&rdquo; Bart said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; Lucia said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you pay me the big bucks. Look, it&rsquo;s quittin time. How about we go grab a drink or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s why I pay you the big bucks,&rdquo; Bart said, rising. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn right,&rdquo; said Lucia walking out of the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recommend we take any longer than we have to,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;But we shouldn&rsquo;t do anything until those headbands arrive. When did Pat say they&rsquo;d arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hopefully, later today,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;So, a three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A three,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t shoot us, we&rsquo;re still alive, and I don&rsquo;t hear the sound of helicopters outside. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bad?&rdquo; Kyle asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one wanted anything,&rdquo; Mac said. He saw the look of confusion on most everyone&rsquo;s faces. &ldquo;We want to be left alone. We offered them cures to things that none of those people want, except for the three scientists, and they don&rsquo;t count for crap when it comes to final decisions. We didn&rsquo;t offer the politicians money, the generals weapons, or the scientists knowledge. We offered them toys, basically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is why I despise politicians and generals!&rdquo; Angela said. &ldquo;Present company excepted, no offense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None taken,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;Besides, I was an admiral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they listen to you, then?&rdquo; Angela asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I took off the uniform,&rdquo; Mac said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan told you not to take it off,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t mean that literally,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;Yes, he took off his jacket during the conference, but what he means is that he retired and he grew his hair long, which is, again, more important metaphorically than literally. He switched teams, and they didn&rsquo;t feel like they had to listen to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, I get that,&rdquo; Angela said. &ldquo;You gave up all your power and influence and so you lost your voice. Ironic, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that ironic?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You become a merman and you lose your voice,&rdquo; Angela said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Mac said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OMG, like &hellip; The Little Mermaid?&rdquo; Belle said. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ever watch Disney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohhhh, right. No, I missed all those cartoons,&rdquo; Mac admitted. &ldquo;Wished I hadn&rsquo;t. I might have been a better father to Sally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of that,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d been a better father, we wouldn&rsquo;t be mers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, here&rsquo;s to sucky fathers making us mermaids!&rdquo; Angela said.</p>
<p>Mac scowled at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Present company excepted, sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Fuuuuuuck, man. Lighten up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, at least we can return to science for the rest of the day,&rdquo; said Phoebe trying to brighten the mood. &ldquo;Eric and Trevor&rsquo;s pod are on their way, and we can stick some more probes into Eric and see what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think in a past life, you were German,&rdquo; Galina said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t insult the Germans. They&rsquo;re good people,&rdquo; Pat teased. &ldquo;Phoebe&rsquo;s far worse than that. I bet she was the only girl in her school who pulled wings off of flies or legs off of ants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lexi and Valerie Dawson,&rdquo; Phoebe said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, they were your cousins,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eureka!!&rdquo; shouted Rose as she surfaced in the lab pool. She held up a handful of tiny metal medallions, each about the size of a small coin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? What&rsquo;s the hubbub?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hubbub? Did you just say Hubbub?&rdquo; Phoebe teased.</p>
<p>The rest of Trevor&rsquo;s pod surfaced next to Rose as Eric, Sally, Liga, and Mari surfaced too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric is a genius!&rdquo; Rose said. &ldquo;He figured out something amazing about our mer senses and our headbands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>Rose kicked herself up into the lab and waited a second for the water to fall off her. She salamandered over to Pat and carefully poured over dozens of the small medallions onto the table. Pat picked one up and looked at it closely. It was made out of the same material as their headbands, intricately woven strands of polymerized sea metals that sparkled and flashed with countless colors. The woven strands in the tiny circle depicted the same &ldquo;folded blanket&rdquo; ornament that graced their headbands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One side feels incredibly smooth while the other feels funny, almost fuzzy in a way,&rdquo; Pat observed as she rubbed the medallion between two fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her guess,&rdquo; Rose admonished as Eric prepared to explain.</p>
<p>Pat shuffled over to a microscope and placed the charm sized circle onto a glass and slid it under the lens. Her long, auburn hair fell forward over her face as she lowered her face to the eyepieces. She carefully nudged the glass back and forth, brought it back out, flipped the charm over, and then repeated her careful examination. She straightened up and looked at Rose.</p>
<p>Rose smiled as she watched Pat scrutinize her face, ears, neck, and hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn around,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>Rose rolled her tail over, allowing her torso to spin around so she was sitting on the floor like a normal human. Pat bent over and examined her dorsal ridge in the area even with the top of Rose&rsquo;s hips. There she could see two medallions sticking to the sides of her ridge, just below her scale line. Pat moved Rose&rsquo;s black fringes to the side, bent over, getting a good look at the medallions. She gently pressed a fingernail along the side of one medallion, testing its adhesion. It was not going to be dislodged easily. She straightened back up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well? What do you think?&rdquo; Eric asked, grinning like a little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, we&rsquo;ve got five bucks riding on this one,&rdquo; Sally said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, eh?&rdquo; Pat said, warming to the contest. &ldquo;Alright. These little gems probably enhance our mer senses in some way, and I&rsquo;m going to bet it means that they&rsquo;re sharper, clearer, and stronger. The fuzzy side acts like velcro, sticking to our nanostructured skin cells, and the positioning of each medallion correlates to where Eric can see our connections leaving and entering our bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric gaped at Pat, his eyes as wide as saucers. &ldquo;Holy cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bingo,&rdquo; Rose said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, smarty pants, get your tail up here and let&rsquo;s find out how you were able to do that,&rdquo; Pat said, patting the surface of the table before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know how you just did that! I mean, you got it perfect,&rdquo; Eric said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; Pat said. Phoebe rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl power,&rdquo; Sally said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how she does it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You explained how you could see our connections, and how when we were in formation, communicating long distance, energy seemed to leave each mer from their headband and flow into our backs,&rdquo; Pat explained. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t hard to figure out from those clues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said butt,&rdquo; Sally joked. &ldquo;He has a thing for butts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, who&rsquo;s idea was it to put contact lenses on our mer senses at the location of our mer organs?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was his,&rdquo; Sally admitted. &ldquo;And, now we can all make the headbands and medallions! All of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Pat asked, astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rose said. &ldquo;After everyone was wearing the medallions, they could see how I was folding the energy at the tip of my knife. They could even see the CHEW blanket pattern in 3-D, which I hadn&rsquo;t realized I was doing when I explained to to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, our bonds with Rose helped us do it, but we couldn&rsquo;t explain what we were doing,&rdquo; Trevor said. &ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s like putting a telescope on your eyes. We can sense things that are miles and miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And stuff that&rsquo;s close, is like, so beautiful, clear, and like, amazing,&rdquo; Cleo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, we can sort of see the connections, just like Eric!&rdquo; Rikki said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see CHEW?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he really sees the connections, and the color and everything,&rdquo; Rikki explained. &ldquo;We only see the electrical looking thread that snakes between us. It just looks yellow, not all the other colors that Eric can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is OUTSTANDING,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! And we can talk without the formation&ndash;miles and miles!&rdquo; Trevor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miles and miles?&rdquo; Pat asked. &ldquo;How do you know? Have you tested it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your contact lenses on, and get into the pool,&rdquo; advised Rose pushing two charms towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know where to put them?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just reach around and follow your instincts,&rdquo; Rose said. &ldquo;We can do our own, but only Eric can do someone else. He&rsquo;s the only one who can clearly see the actual CHEW as it leaves the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat picked up a charm and reached around behind her back. She ran the charm along the edge of her ridge and suddenly felt a tingle along her back. She moved the charm back and forth until she was sure she had the spot where the tingle was the strongest and pressed the fuzzy side to her body. It felt good, she realized, like pressing a warm compress over a sore muscle. She repeated the operation on the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., that was easy,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;Now what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go into the pool and wait a second,&rdquo; said Rose as she shuffled towards the water.</p>
<p>While Pat headed for the pool, Phoebe, Galina, and Alexis all put on their medallions. Soon everyone was back in the pool, which wasn&rsquo;t a particularly large one, and so it was a bit crowded.</p>
<p>[Ready?] Rose asked.</p>
<p>[Ready,] Pat answered.</p>
<p>[Trixi, you there?] Rose said. A few seconds later, Trixi answered.</p>
<p>[Can you hear me now?] she asked.</p>
<p>[Yes, perfectly,] Rose answered. [Can everyone else?]</p>
<p>All the adults nodded.</p>
<p>[Trixi, where are you?] Pat asked.</p>
<p>[Hi Pat! We&rsquo;ve been swimming at top speed for over two hours,] Trixi answered. [Mark thinks we are about seventy-five miles out.]</p>
<p>[That&rsquo;s about one hundred and twenty kilometers, and you&rsquo;re reaching us in the lab pool, with no direct line of sight!] said Pat. [This is more than amazing, it&rsquo;s a miracle.]</p>
<p>[We have a long list of miracles to account for,] joked John as he released Maureen so she could swim to her mother.</p>
<p>[I suppose so,] Pat agreed. [We could start with the little miracle right here,] she said, gathering her daughter into her arms.</p>
<p>[Who are you talking to?] Trixi asked.</p>
<p>[John,] Pat answered. [Couldn&rsquo;t you hear him?]</p>
<p>[No,] Trixi answered. [It seems like we have to picture the person before we can hear them.]</p>
<p>[I&rsquo;ll bet that an unconscious trigger would do it,] Pat said. [We all heard you just fine after Rose dialed you in. None of us actively pictured you.]</p>
<p>[Yea, that makes sense,] Trixi said. [I can sort of sense more mers there with you now that I realize that you and Rose aren&rsquo;t alone.]</p>
<p>[Right, either a conscious or unconscious trigger probably does it,] said Pat thinking aloud. [I&rsquo;ll bet we can&rsquo;t do this with a stranger. We would have no memory of their CHEW to focus on, no way to dial them in. Are you still swimming? I can sort of sense you doing that.]</p>
<p>[Yea, we plan to keep going for another twelve hours,] Trixi reported. [All you have to do is picture one of us in your head and that seems to focus the CHEW in our direction.]</p>
<p>[We need to get these to the mers in Maryland right away,] Galina said. [If we can communicate across the oceans, we might just survive the next few months.]</p>
<p>[Or years,] Alexis said.</p>
<p>[Why is it all you guys think we&rsquo;re in trouble?] Phoebe asked. [I still don&rsquo;t understand. I thought they liked us.]</p>
<p>[The generals never smiled,] Galina said. [They want our knowledge and power but they fear our Device.]</p>
<p>[It&rsquo;s a good idea, Galina, though we don&rsquo;t have any memory of their patterns. It&rsquo;s worth a try to send them a few of these medallions,] Pat agreed.</p>
<p>[I&rsquo;ll bet Sally can dial her father in, even though she doesn&rsquo;t know Mac the merman&rsquo;s signal,] Eric said.</p>
<p>[Let&rsquo;s hope so,] Pat agreed. [We&rsquo;ll give it a whirl in any event. Better safe than sorry. Let&rsquo;s get back into the lab, and get that going. And let&rsquo;s get you up onto a table and under some instruments.]</p>
<p>[Damn,] Eric said. [Me and my big mouth. I hate your instruments.]</p>
<p>[They are also my instruments,] said Alexis pushing her breasts into his arm. [If you&rsquo;re a good boy and let us test you again, I&rsquo;ll make you feel all better after it&rsquo;s over.]</p>
<p>A much younger looking Jackson Baker carried the FedEx box into the main viewing room. Everyone else was looking and feeling younger too, and they clustered around as he opened the box and lifted out the twentyfour beautiful headbands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody gets one,&rdquo; said Jack as he spread them out on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not all the same,&rdquo; Amanda noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They come in boys and girls sizes,&rdquo; said Joy from her perch in the tank. &ldquo;You should be able to tell the difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, there are six for boys and eighteen for girls,&rdquo; Annie said, lifting one to her own head. &ldquo;These are beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack grabbed four and walked over to the tank. He tossed them, one at a time, up to Joy. She caught each one and handed them down to her pod mates as they swam by. A gasp rose up from the crowd as Bonnie snapped into view, adjusting her headband as she swam. Joy looked down and watched as both Annette and Mac snapped into view as they put on their headbands. She let go of the tank wall and sank, reappearing herself a few seconds later as she put her headband on.</p>
<p>The four mers looked at each other, gesturing like they were talking, but their mouths weren&rsquo;t moving. The humans all put on a headband and then watched the silent conversation in the tank.</p>
<p>[We&rsquo;re talking with CHEW,] Joy explained. [Finally!]</p>
<p>[Why is your hair blond?] Bonnie asked her former wife.</p>
<p>[My hair is blond?] Annette shrieked. [Oh, my! My hair IS blond,] she gushed as she pulled a strand in front of her face.</p>
<p>[What&rsquo;s going on?] Mac asked. [Why has our camouflage turned off?]</p>
<p>Joy swam closer to Mac and gave his face, neck, and chest a close examination.</p>
<p>[It&rsquo;s not off,] she said. [It&rsquo;s just getting more than one signal. The headbands strengthen and focus our CHEW, and our CHEW must affect our chromatophores. Maybe we can control how we look, finally.]</p>
<p>[Now, that would be outstanding! Let me try something,] Mac said.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and concentrated. As both his pod-mates and the humans watched, his body slowly changed appearance. Like the slow creep of color across a chameleon&rsquo;s back, Mac&rsquo;s tail turned a magnificent dark blue and his torso returned to his former beige color. He opened his eyes, and they were blue again. He blinked, and suddenly he was gone, his camouflage back on at full strength. Then, the blue tail slowly returned, creeping up his body inch by inch.</p>
<p>The rest of the mers all closed their eyes, and slowly the colorings they had dreamed of began to appear.</p>
<p>Joy&rsquo;s tail turned blue, and her fringes turned white, her brown eyes sparkled with flecks of gold and yellow and her hair was a lustrous mix of browns. Annette&rsquo;s hair turned a brilliant, golden blond, and her eyes were green again, but this time with the mermaid sparkle that made them spectacular, and her tail turned a rich red color with white highlights and white fringes. Bonnie&rsquo;s tail also turned red but she had green highlights and fringes, and her eyes were blue and her hair was a classic, Celtic red. All of the mers looked, more or less, just like the ones on Mermaid Island.</p>
<p>[This is amazing,] Mac said. [The picture in my mind was so easy to keep, and it&rsquo;s getting easier to turn it on and off.]</p>
<p>He demonstrated by flashing between camo and color modes, back and forth. The other mers also experimented with switching between their camo and color configurations, their speeds increasing as they got the hang of the mental focus needed to make the switch. After a few minutes of experimenting, everyone returned to their new color schemes.</p>
<p>[It&rsquo;s almost as if this is our new neutral,] said Joy indicating her blue tail.</p>
<p>[Let&rsquo;s test it,] Annette said. [Let&rsquo;s exit as colored mers and see if it holds.]</p>
<p>The mers all nodded and rose to the surface of the tank. They held their new colors when their faces and hands broke the surface of the water. Mac smirked at Joy and she shouted, &ldquo;Make a hole,&rdquo; and everyone scrambled. Mac ducked down, not disappearing this time, and flipped himself out of the tank, somersaulting onto the floor as usual, water splashing everywhere. His new coloring remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It works!&rdquo; Mac said, admiring his deep, blue tail.</p>
<p>His three mermaids followed, and everyone admired their beautiful coloring. The mermaids squeezed the water from their hair and began running their fingers through the long tresses. Angela walked over to Bonnie admiring her tail and new hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be a redhead,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Would that be alright with you?&rdquo; she asked, turning back to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can be anything you want, my dear. As long as you don&rsquo;t mind me being so old school,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re growing on me, old man,&rdquo; Angela teased. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll be good for each other, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so,&rdquo; Jack said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not hydrophobic,&rdquo; Mac observed, &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a small price to pay for our camouflage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But our skin and hair are drying much faster than normal, human hair,&rdquo; Annette said, running her hands through her thick, golden hair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only been a few minutes and my hair is nearly dry. When I was a kid and had hair this long, it would take almost an hour for it to air dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good! Maybe we still have some hydrodynamic advantages even if our skin isn&rsquo;t completely hydrophobic,&rdquo; said Joy fluffing out her own hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so! I can&rsquo;t wait to get out into open water and see how fast we can go,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to suffer no end of teasing from Mark if I can&rsquo;t keep up with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can always sneak up on him,&rdquo; Bonnie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His mer senses work just as good as ours,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;Our camouflage can never protect us from another mer, only from sighted predators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes us good spies, at least, on humans,&rdquo; Annette said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope it doesn&rsquo;t come to that,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;Though, after this morning&rsquo;s phone call, I&rsquo;m not very confident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you control your camouflage out of the water now?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Mac said.</p>
<p>He looked over his body, concentrating. He closed his eyes and furrowed his brow, and his skin flickered, a flash of silver running across his body. He opened his eyes and looked around the room, seeking a spot on the wall with a relatively solid surface and nothing mounted on it. He salamandered over to the blank spot and sat down with his back against the wall and his tail stretched out before him. He looked down at his tail and concentrated, his skin flickered once, and then he snapped out of view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; Mac&rsquo;s voice emerged from the apparently empty space. &ldquo;Can you see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just barely, but that&rsquo;s because I know you&rsquo;re there,&rdquo; Jack answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can see you fine,&rdquo; said Joy looking at her pod mates. &ldquo;But we are bonded to you, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too hard to do once you find the switch,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to explain, but it feels like a blanket I&rsquo;m pulling up over my body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it take a lot of energy?&rdquo; Joy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, it does,&rdquo; Mac admitted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot easier in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s automatic in the water,&rdquo; Annette said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste any more energy doing that,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;I can sense how much effort that takes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Mac his camo snapping off. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got other issues at the moment, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, and we best get on with it,&rdquo; Jack said, looking over the three people who were forming his pod. &ldquo;If all heck is going to break loose, I&rsquo;d love to be able to swim away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;O.K. folks, line up. Sasha, you&rsquo;re with Mac, the rest of you are with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least this time you&rsquo;ll keep your eyes open,&rdquo; Sasha teased as she walked towards him.</p>
<p>Mac looked over the ex-schoolteacher as she knelt before him. Sasha&rsquo;s Nordic and Eastern European heritage was visible in her blond hair, her sharp features, and her height. As the first feedings had youthened everyone, the view was considerably better than it was yesterday. He had no problems tugging on his vent muscle and allowing her to get started on her second feeding.</p>
<p>Cassie shared Bonnie with Jack. Cassie hoped Bonnie&rsquo;s mermaid milk was stronger than Mac&rsquo;s semen. Her long simmering attraction to Jack was now a bonfire of passion, but she still looked like a man. Granted, she now looked like a slightly younger man, but Jack&rsquo;s eyes still showed his revulsion. How she craved the return of the love she had felt for him since they were in college! She avoided his gaze as they each positioned themselves on either side of Bonnie.</p>
<p>Cassie cradled Bonnie&rsquo;s large breast in her hands, wondering how Jack&rsquo;s nearness might influence how she turned out. She could feel Jack&rsquo;s head next to her own as he drank from their shared mermaid. As she started to suckle, she remembered back to her college days, to the night she got drunk and confessed &ldquo;his&rdquo; love for Jack. In the days following her admission, she feared that Jack would humiliate and expose him. Carl&rsquo;s crush on the tall, gangly Jack blossomed into respect and admiration because Jack never teased him and remained a friend throughout his whole life. If becoming a woman was the price of finally winning Jack&rsquo;s love, then Cassie was going to accept that bargain.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes, everyone had finished their feeding and Mac urged everyone up into the tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were infected by those microorganisms, not mermaid milk,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;So, those little buggers are alive and well in that tank. It should help speed up the Type II transformations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone turned to look at Jack, knowing he might have something to say about everyone clambering into his precious tank. Jack felt everyone&rsquo;s gaze, and looked at the several cuttlefish he could see. One of his prized molluscs had already died, but the prospect of putting to rest the torment in his heart was stronger. He looked back at Cassie, wishing she looked less like Carl and more like a woman. He knew she pinned for him, but he could not bring himself to comfort her.</p>
<p>Jack looked at Angela and Belle. They both smiled warmly, and Jack&rsquo;s heart thumped in his chest. Both had always been attractive, if very angry, young women, and Jack had often wished he could take away the pain their insestuous fathers had inflicted upon them. Both were now looking fresh, young, and without tattoos or other body markings. Both had discarded the various piercings that had marked their bodies as well. As he watched, Angela reached out for Cassie&rsquo;s hand and gave it a squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all get into the tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;Grab some floats so that everyone can be comfortable in the center of the tank. Each of you should focus on your own pods, and we&rsquo;ll surround all of you and see if our mer organs can&rsquo;t add a bit of push to things. If we&rsquo;re lucky, we can speed everyone through the second stage of transformation, and then we&rsquo;ll have enough mermaid milk producers to begin the final changes later tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; Mac agreed. &ldquo;And you should all be naked, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone blinked for a moment as they realized what they were about to do. Annie stood up and began taking off her clothes. She was nearly six feet tall and while she still looked like a middle-aged woman, she was a very beautiful and handsome middle-aged woman. Everyone followed her lead, and soon they were all naked.</p>
<p>Kyle brought out an armful of life vests and shared them with the eight humans. As they all started for the tank, Jack&rsquo;s computer beeped. Kyle and his pod climbed into the tank as Jack walked over to the computer and checked his email. After reading the message, he straightened up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan will be here tomorrow morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; Joy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in code, mostly,&rdquo; Jack answered. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;ll come with her pod and she has troublesome news to share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s deal with it tomorrow,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;All the more reason to get into the tank now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack nodded and turned to help Angela up the ladder. She hesitated a moment, torn between her habit of fierce independence and the affection she felt building for her old family friend. She smiled, and held out her hand like she was a grand lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my darling,&rdquo; Angela said with a terrible British accent. &ldquo;How lovely of you to assist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss the angry little girl with fire in her eyes,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you worry,&rdquo; she said in her normal voice. &ldquo;That little girl will never leave you. The fire is still there, it&rsquo;s just got a different reason to burn,&rdquo; she finished with a passionate kiss on Jack&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>He blinked, shocked, recovered, and helped her up the stairs, admiring her long, lean lines as she clambered up and into the tank. He helped Belle next, and she kissed him too. Finally Cassie stepped up to the bottom of the ladder. Jack could see the fear of rejection in her eyes, and he was determined to wipe it from her face. Jack looked past the still male face, thinking about the woman yet to be, and saw the sparkle of love in her blue eyes. He grabbed her hand and brought her into a kiss, feeling a touch of whisker brush against his chin as he kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Cassie said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should have done that years ago,&rdquo; Jack said, and together they climbed up into the tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe we didn&rsquo;t think of this before!&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t guess everything on the first go,&rdquo; Phoebe said. &ldquo;Besides, that&rsquo;s why they call it science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look who is giving the lesson now,&rdquo; Pat teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is synesthesia?&rdquo; Sally asked. &ldquo;Is it rare? Will it hurt him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will have no ill effects from such a thing,&rdquo; Galina said. &ldquo;In fact, it is likely that such a thing will help him and his children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s genetic,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;Last I heard the jury was still out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Da,&rdquo; Galina agreed. &ldquo;If it is genetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, our children might be affected?&rdquo; Sally asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Pat admitted. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not something you should worry about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Eric said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, and I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Sally said. &ldquo;But I just don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sort of like reverse color blindness,&rdquo; Phoebe said. &ldquo;Instead of losing a sense, you gain one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually not an uncommon phenomena,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;Synesthesia appears in about five percent of the population, so it was about time we had one. In this case, Eric&rsquo;s mer senses have fused with his sense of color, giving visual definition and spatial clarity to a non-visual and non-spatial stimulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have such a thing before you were a mer?&rdquo; Galina asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Eric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did colors have smells or did numbers or letters have some other quality, like color, personality or a position in three dimensional space?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I can remember,&rdquo; Eric said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is probable product of the transition,&rdquo; Galina said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Pat agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as he&rsquo;s alright,&rdquo; said Sally helping Eric down from the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly fine,&rdquo; Eric said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, get started on those medallions,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;The seaplane will be here in two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone should come out to the uprise,&rdquo; Eric said. &ldquo;That way everyone can learn how to polymerize!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malaki watched as the mers headed into the surf, among them, his former son. He had successfully worked free one of his bindings, and with patience he would soon be able to &ldquo;fake&rdquo; his bindings so as to fool the humans who remained on the beach. He wished that he could take action against Harold&rsquo;s pod, killing his former son, but he was unlikely to have that chance, and he knew that the mers were stronger and quicker than humans. No, if he was to inflict any kind of revenge, it would have to be upon the two human pods, who had yet to finish their transformations into those hated creatures.</p>
<p>Perhaps he could act this evening, as they all slept. What a sweet revenge that would be! To kill all eight remaining humans just as they were on the cusp of transformation. In his head, he laughed like a madman, but in his body, he continued to flex the ropes that still bound his wrists together.</p>
<p>After an hour in the tank, Cassie felt the first twinges of pressure begin to build around her. An hour after that, the first bubbles began forming on her body. For the next hour or so, the bubbles appeared only in patches and only briefly. By the end of the third hour in the tank, the bubbles began to appear more regularly, and by the end of the fourth hour, she was the only one who still had bubbles appearing on her body.</p>
<p>She looked around the tank. She was the only one still using a float, all the others had completed the second stage of transformation. They had gills, webbing, and youthful, healthy, beautiful bodies. She could see her body appearing younger, caught in a state of androgyny. She clearly had a long way to go.</p>
<p>She had help, however, and that was a comfort to her floating alone, on the surface. Kyle&rsquo;s pod had dispersed themselves among Mac&rsquo;s pod, all of them focusing on her change. Jack and the rest of her pod stayed close to her, and she could feel their hands on her body as she struggled to keep the change going.</p>
<p>She took the life vest off her neck, took a deep breath, and then let herself sink below the surface. She waited for the bubbles to appear, welcoming them as they did. They were getting thicker and more vigorous. She felt her breath grow stale and she pulled herself up again. She repeated that pattern for another twenty minutes, the bubbles slowly growing stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>A stab of pain jerked her hips, and she welcomed the clear sign of her body speeding up its journey. Another twenty minutes later, pressure grew along her limbs and head as her body slowly, painfully reshaped itself. Her stomach rumbled after four hours in the tank, but she didn&rsquo;t want to stop the process. The bubbles now blanketed her body, the changes happening in minutes, rather than hours.</p>
<p>Her abdomen burned as her internal organs changed and moved, and her face seemed swollen and numb. Fingers and feet ached, elbows and shoulders throbbed, hips stretched, and her skull pressed into her brain. After six hours, the pressure finally eased, and the bubbles slowly faded. She realized that she had spent the last thirty minutes completely underwater, and she smiled at her pod as they embraced her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just sign here,&rdquo; the young pilot indicated a line on his clipboard. Michael signed with a flourish, smiling as he watched the young man try to keep from gaping at his girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gonna be here long?&rdquo; The young man asked, his khaki pants tenting across his stiffening penis seeing Lucy and Pearl splash each other in the shallow surf near his seaplane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be someone here, but we might get rotated back to the states any time,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all are scientists?&rdquo; the pilot said. &ldquo;You all don&rsquo;t look like scientists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think we&rsquo;re not scientists?&rdquo; Martin asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you all look young,&rdquo; the equally young man said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not all young,&rdquo; Conjo said as Martin helped him down off the float and into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no offense,&rdquo; the pilot said. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t look like a scientist either, and I&rsquo;ve never seen girls that pretty who are science types,&rdquo; he finished, his gaze roving across the six women scattered across the beach and in the surf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just goes to show, you can&rsquo;t judge a book by its cover,&rdquo; Martin said with a touch of hardness in his voice.</p>
<p>The young pilot looked at the the chiseled, tanned, and steely-eyed man who had one foot on the float to the plane. He seemed to be in his midtwenties, about six feet tall (183 cm), and in really good shape. Both men had longer than average hair, and all six women were stunningly beautiful. All eight young people had some sort of tattoo on their backs, sort of like angel wings. The old man he had just ferried to the island looked like a common laborer, but his English was surprisingly good. The pilot decided to let it drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This should get there in about two or three days,&rdquo; the pilot said, taking the small box from Martin. &ldquo;Overnight simply isn&rsquo;t possible from this location.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner the better,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The contents are inert, non-biological, right?&rdquo; the pilot asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The contents are inert, yes,&rdquo; Michael said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping that the labs back in Maryland can tell us more about what other properties these metallic objects might have. We trust that these will arrive safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are what is in the box,&rdquo; Martin said, unfurling his fist.</p>
<p>The pilot looked over at the eight, small metallic disks in Martin&rsquo;s palm. They didn&rsquo;t look particularly valuable, though they were pretty in their own way. They looked like expensive screens that might be used as a filter. The pilot lifted an eyebrow at Martin in a question, and Martin picked up a disk and offered it to the pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find these?&rdquo; the pilot asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a lot of questions for a FedEx pilot,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an independent contractor. The FedEx people are in Suva,&rdquo; the young man said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just curious, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t find them,&rdquo; Martin said. &ldquo;We made them. They are lighter and stronger than normal metallic screens and we think we might get rich on the process if they are as tough and strong as we think they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well good luck to you, then,&rdquo; the pilot said, understanding now why the beautiful women might be attached to men who might become rich. &ldquo;I hope we can do a lot of business in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope so too,&rdquo; said Michael handing back the clipboard.</p>
<p>The pilot tucked the box and the clipboard under his arm and climbed back up into his seaplane. Michael and Martin pushed the seaplane back out into the lagoon and then turned it towards the open sea. The pilot started his engines, taxied out of the lagoon, roared off into the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he seem overly curious to you?&rdquo; Martin asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, but I think it was mostly because the girls were so beautiful,&rdquo; Michael said, turning back towards the beach where the six women had gathered. &ldquo;He probably hoped that he could snag one for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose a stranger wouldn&rsquo;t recognize bonded pods,&rdquo; Martin agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pods?&rdquo; Conjo asked as he followed the two young men up onto the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story, but I&rsquo;m sure that we&rsquo;ll eventually fill in all the details,&rdquo; Michael said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find us?&rdquo; Martin asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I last spoke with Joy, she gave me Mr. Kolbert&rsquo;s information. He was kind enough to arrange passage from Davao to Suva, and I was only there a day when this opportunity arose,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>Michael could see that Conjo was feeling self-conscious around so many beautiful women. He thought to make some sort of introduction or icebreaker when Vidya squealed in recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; she screamed, rushing towards the three men as they waded through the surf. &ldquo;I knew that you were one of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw her arms around the old man, startling and embarrassing him, as she kissed him on both cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe was the one who bought me but didn&rsquo;t use me,&rdquo; Vidya said to her sisters. &ldquo;Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you were part of the rescue!&rdquo; Rani said, coming forward and giving Conjo a welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only sorry I did not arrive in time to save your sister,&rdquo; Conjo said. &ldquo;She was &hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared at Geeta, confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But &hellip; I buried you!&rdquo; he exclaimed, thinking he was seeing a ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; Geeta said. &ldquo;I was her brother, and now I have taken her place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conjo&rsquo;s jaw worked silently, his mind struggling with the miraculous paradox before him. After a second, Vidya and Rani guided him to the sand where he sat down with a thump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not only a long story; it is also a very good one,&rdquo; said Geeta as she walked towards her sisters and the old man, who was clearly shaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go round up some dinner while you guys fill him in?&rdquo; Liz suggested, pulling off her bikini top and wiggling out of her bottoms. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back in an hour or so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a wonderful idea,&rdquo; Geeta said, smiling at the glint she saw in Liz&rsquo;s eyes. She and her sister-wives had spent some time ravaging Martin while gathering lunch earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every time I get an excuse to wear this wonderful bikini, you find a way to get me out of it,&rdquo; complained Pearl as she dropped her top and bottoms too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take much to get you out of clothes,&rdquo; said Lucy, rubbing her breasts as they fell free from the bikini top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see how long Michael can hold his breath,&rdquo; Liz said, walking into the lagoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may take more than an hour to get dinner,&rdquo; said Michael grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will probably take more than an hour to explain everything to Conjo,&rdquo; Martin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do that again!&rdquo; Susan Perelli exclaimed.</p>
<p>The small, Italian dynamo clutched Miriam Dander&rsquo;s hand, both of them standing before the glass wall of Jackson Baker&rsquo;s tank. She gasped as Mac&rsquo;s pod switched from camo to color to brown. Her jaw nearly dropped off her face when they flashed each other&rsquo;s colors in rotation, alternating between red and blue tails and various highlights in an extravagant rotoscope of color and light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s amazing,&rdquo; Miriam said, a youthful light shining in her old, weary eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Susan, a visage of professionalism and power falling over her face like a mask. &ldquo;All the more reason why we cannot waste another moment,&rdquo; she finished, waving Mac&rsquo;s pod up and out of the tank.</p>
<p>Once everyone one was assembled in the main viewing room, Susan looked over the mixture of humans and mers. She realized, much to her amazement, that she, Bill, and Miriam were the only ones wearing clothes. When Jack greeted her at the door to his house, he had been wearing a robe. He was also youthful and terribly handsome. After she had been shown the tank and the mers, she didn&rsquo;t notice anyone else, but she realized that they had been naked since she had arrived. Jack must have discarded the robe before entering the tank viewing room. The mers were in their &ldquo;colorful&rdquo; state, and the humans were all clustered, like the mers, into pods of three females to one male. Everyone in the room, human and mer, were stunning specimens of beauty, power, and grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admiral Bennett &hellip;&rdquo; she began, trying to ignore everyone&rsquo;s nakedness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mac, just Mac,&rdquo; Mac said with a scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mac, yes, of course,&rdquo; Susan said. &ldquo;Well, sir, you were right. General David Stottomeyer authorized the raid on this island, and he appears to be arranging assets and personnel for a second try, but this time using Homeland Security.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a military raid, then?&rdquo; Mac asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct sir,&rdquo; Susan said. &ldquo;We have been tracking communications that seem to suggest that he has an ally in Justice, though we cannot be sure. It looks to be less a raid and more of an administrative takeover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice?&rdquo; Angela asked. &ldquo;I thought these intra-agency black ops only happened in Hollywood movies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo; Susan asked, looking over at the redheaded beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angela, I&rsquo;m with him,&rdquo; she said, jerking a thumb at Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angela, nice to meet you,&rdquo; Susan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art often mirrors life,&rdquo; Joy interrupted. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re right, these types of efforts are the exception, not the rule. What&rsquo;s the link between his raid and our polycom? He was cranked about Jack and this island before he knew about mermaids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be sure,&rdquo; said Susan looking back at the brunette mermaid with the long blue tail. &ldquo;But here is where Miriam can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan turned to her old friend and offered her the floor. Miriam Danders glanced around the room, nervously eyeing both humans and mers. She seemed agitated, but Susan waited for her friend to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been authorized to give you any details, and frankly I don&rsquo;t know any real details, which is one of the reasons why I got sent,&rdquo; Miriam said. &ldquo;As you know, my boss is the President&rsquo;s Chief of Staff, and he&rsquo;s inclined to work towards some sort of recognition of MMI and the work you could accomplish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, looking at the mers again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, he is only one voice in the room, and some of the president&rsquo;s advisors seem determined to secure the potential services of mers towards their exclusive ends. You probably surmised as much during our polycom,&rdquo; she said to nods all around the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The President is in a delicate position,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;And while I don&rsquo;t know anything officially, the problem is more political than legal. He believes that if you can lie low for a while, the political problem will resolve itself, and we can move forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stottomeyer has some shit on the President, doesn&rsquo;t he, and he&rsquo;s trying to exploit it for power,&rdquo; Mac said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can neither confirm nor deny,&rdquo; Miriam said nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; Mac said. &ldquo;David is a weasley bastard who resents civilian oversight. Most of the Joint Command despise him, or at least they did a few months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They still do,&rdquo; Susan reported. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s become powerful &hellip; a problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re being leveraged as the political bait?&rdquo; Joy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bait that the President hopes would actually escape and survive,&rdquo; Miriam said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in agreement, then,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t know anything, but surely you might have imagined some things we ought to consider doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Miriam said, smiling for the first time. &ldquo;You might consider giving an old woman from New Hampshire a new start, and she might form a trustworthy and secure link to the civilian leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we had already agreed that you guys were going to join us?&rdquo; said Joy looking at Bill, Susan, and Miriam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the circumstances, we thought a formal invitation might be more useful,&rdquo; Miriam said. &ldquo;And &hellip; well, there is another issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always another issue,&rdquo; said Joy rolling her eyes. &ldquo;What is it? Someone&rsquo;s cousin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good guess,&rdquo; Susan said with a laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Stottomeyer&rsquo;s nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; Joy exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought he was the problem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Commander James Roberts, currently assigned to Navy Intelligence, is the nephew of General David Stottomeyer,&rdquo; Susan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hates his uncle,&rdquo; Miriam said. &ldquo;He came to our office about a year ago and volunteered to help corral the general. We haven&rsquo;t had a worthy opportunity to do so until now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the opportunity&rdquo; Joy asked, looking at Bill, whom she saw wasn&rsquo;t overly concerned with where the conversation was headed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would join our pod,&rdquo; Susan explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., what about Bill?&rdquo; Joy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lieutenant Commander would become a mermaid,&rdquo; Miriam said. &ldquo;James is bi-sexual and is willing to experiment, but more importantly, the President believes that such a move would help ease the political issues we mentioned before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we don&rsquo;t need to know why or how, I suppose,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;Do you need a formal invitation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miriam nodded. Joy looked at the rest of her pod and then Kyle and Jack&rsquo;s pods. She turned back to Miriam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re placing a lot of trust in you,&rdquo; Joy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Susan trusts her, I trust her,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then consider this a formal invitation,&rdquo; Joy said. &ldquo;What does this do to our timetable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can be here in two days,&rdquo; Miriam said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think assets will be in place for Stottomeyer to make his move for another five or six days,&rdquo; Susan confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gives us a two day cushion,&rdquo; Joy said, doing the math in her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the tank doesn&rsquo;t increase its level of agency,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been getting stronger and stronger with each change. We might be changed even sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sooner is better,&rdquo; Joy agreed. &ldquo;We can hang out for a day or so if we have to, but we can&rsquo;t speed up changes if we have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to secure this facility if Homeland Security takes it over?&rdquo; Susan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the sea gates open, and fish that leave, leave; and ones that don&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t. Theoretically, the system can keep the tank clean for several years, but the batteries for the lights will wear out sooner. If the mers are still in trouble at that time, the tank will be the least of my worries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we leave, they can come in through the sea gates and get into the pool,&rdquo; Joy argued. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what started Mac and I on our journey. They could become mers on their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure that&rsquo;s a bad thing,&rdquo; Bonnie said.</p>
<p>Everyone turned to look at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve experienced as profound a change in my life as anyone could imagine,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I know that I can never feel quite the same way as before, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. I think it would be a good thing if some of the people who were after us became their own guinea pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Annette putting a hand on her lover. &ldquo;You were never going to be those people, and I&rsquo;m not sure they could become people like us. The siren cells are powerful, but I&rsquo;m not sure they insure morality. We need to empty or destroy this tank before we leave. Sorry Jack, it&rsquo;s too dangerous. Look at the transgenetic effects we experienced just by accident. Imagine what could be done if the wrong military scientists tried to exploit the siren cell and the microorganisms in this tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack sighed, looked deep into his tank, and closed his eyes. A single tear fell from the corner of his left eye. He opened them again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We will empty the tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the microorganisms survive in the bay?&rdquo; Joy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might, but it is unlikely they will achieve a critical mass in a body of water this big,&rdquo; Cassie answered. &ldquo;We will all be mers by then, right? Well, then we should just chase all the fish out, and then cook the tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Susan said again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cassie, I&rsquo;m also with him,&rdquo; she answered, similarly jerking her thumb towards Jack.</p>
<p>Susan looked over the tall young woman. She had piercing blue eyes, long golden locks of hair, and a dramatic hourglass figure. She seemed more mature and knowledgeable than the average twenty something year old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi Cassie, nice to meet you. Cook?&rdquo; Susan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to be a biology teacher,&rdquo; Cassie said, answering the unspoken question in Susan&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Cook, means to let it overheat, stop the filters, and kill everything that is left inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that mean that the cuttlefish will die?&rdquo; Joy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d die anyway with Stottomeyer&rsquo;s thugs mucking about,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;If this was summer time, they might survive in the bay for a few months, but the water is too cold for them, but I&rsquo;d rather they died out there than in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry Jack,&rdquo; Cassie said. &ldquo;I know how much you loved those creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I think that I&rsquo;ll have new sea creatures to whom I shall be more devoted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassie leaned over and kissed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should get Susan, Bill, and Miriam started so that when James gets here tomorrow, Bill will be in a position to help things along,&rdquo; Joy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ward, actually,&rdquo; Bill said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo; Joy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ward,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;My family calls me Ward. It&rsquo;s an old family nickname, and since we&rsquo;re about to become a new family, you all should call me Ward. I hate the name Bill or William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you say anything before?&rdquo; Susan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Security regulations makes nicknames a pain in the ass,&rdquo; Ward said. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re past all that now. You should know the real me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ward, eh?&rdquo; Susan said. &ldquo;I kinda like that. My ward and shield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve dreamed of hearing you say that for nearly twenty years,&rdquo; Ward admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, better late than never,&rdquo; Susan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; Ward said.</p>
<p>The evening stars twinkled in a cloudless sky, casting a cool blue light on the island below. The wind was still, the only sound was the waves softly washing up onto the sand. The beach was crowded with mers and humans, and in the middle of the cluster was an elderly Polynesian man who sat with his legs crossed and his chin in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a story,&rdquo; Conjo admitted. &ldquo;And it was long in the telling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry about that,&rdquo; the auburn haired mermaid admitted, her sea green tail flashing in the cool starlight. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to get it shorter, but there&rsquo;s so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re not very good story tellers,&rdquo; the white haired mermaid teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Phoebe, right?&rdquo; Conjo asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Phoebe answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re Pat,&rdquo; said Conjo turning to the auburn haired mermaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an awful lot of you. Hard to keep you all straight,&rdquo; Conjo finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re worth it,&rdquo; said a golden-haired mermaid with a yellow-gold tail. &ldquo;I&quot;m Danni.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; Conjo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, now that you&rsquo;re more or less caught up, what would you like to do?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like Malaki to replace my wife,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I believe that would serve both justice and love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is more generous than many here are willing to be,&rdquo; Pat warned. &ldquo;We will have to think on this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Vidya said, rising. &ldquo;There has been enough death, and we yet face more death in the future. We are not served by more death. Can you agree, my sister?&rdquo; asked Vidya, turning towards Rani.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &hellip; I &hellip; you ask too much,&rdquo; confessed Rani, her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a death, of a kind,&rdquo; Liga said. &ldquo;I do not believe that the person I was before would have or could have chosen this life I have now, and I am glad of his death. Perhaps we can reform even Malaki.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rani nodded, but she looked to Valencia. All eyes then turned towards Valencia. She looked at her pod seeing the love and support in their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Conjo is willing to be master, I will not be an obstacle to this measure of justice,&rdquo; Valencia said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing,&rdquo; Conjo answered. &ldquo;I will try to make some good come out of that lump of water, cells, and flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, you should feed from one of the mothers so that you have both the strength of body and of mer to force Malaki into these changes,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;Whom do you choose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I may be so bold, may I ask of you?&rdquo; Conjo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am honored,&rdquo; answered, Pat feeling the rise of hormones in her breasts. &ldquo;Come, feed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conjo rose from the sand and walked over to Pat. He sat next to her and took her left hand and brought it to his lips. He kissed it softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I hope to be worthy,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Pat guiding his head to her breast. &ldquo;Drink and you will become strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conjo took Pat&rsquo;s nipple into his mouth and sucked. Warm, sweet mermaid milk erupted from her stiff nubbin, and Conjo drank. Energy and vitality surged through his body as he drained her breast in only a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve still got to give Maureen her evening snack, so choose another,&rdquo; Pat said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valencia, there is justice here if you can see it,&rdquo; Conjo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will be pleased to help,&rdquo; Valencia said, pulling her lush brown hair away from her breasts. &ldquo;Take what you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conjo stood up and walked over to the beautiful young mermaid and sank down to the sand next to her. He let her guide his head to her breast and drink from her fullness. The rush of hormones nearly overwhelmed Valencia, and she sighed with pleasure as the old man drank from her breasts. When he had drained both breasts, he was full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Conjo said. &ldquo;I hope to make a worthy merman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re already well on your way,&rdquo; Harold said. &ldquo;We mermen exist for our mates, and Valencia is happy that you&rsquo;ve found a way to bring justice to her father without more death. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have far to travel, but the journey has begun,&rdquo; Conjo said.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>
