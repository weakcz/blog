            <p>It was already dark, when Michelle Jenkins returned to her apartment. She was exhausted, the last weeks had taken a toll on her and she was really glad that the weekend had finally arrived.</p>
<p>Normally she would have been faster at work, but recent events had caused her to doubt her job. The news that the recently discovered meteor could possibly crash into the city had shocked her just as much as anybody else.</p>
<p>But what really disturbed Michelle was the way the media, including the TV station she was working for, handled this topic. Instead of calming down their viewers, they increased their fears by painting a colorful doomsday scenario. This only caused unnecessary panic. Three month ago the meteor crashed in a corn field –five miles outside the evacuated city. When Michelle was on her way back to her apartment – having spent the last days at her parent’s place – she had found a strange seed on the sidewalk. The young woman decided to keep it as memento and a sign of a new start, now that the meteor posed no more threat.</p>
<p>Now, three months later, this seed had grown to a plant, that was a foot and six inches tall, had no leaves but several things that looked like buds. A week ago the plant had stopped growing in height and the buds were the only things that showed any sign of growth as they grew a bit rounder, but it seems as if those would never bloom.</p>
<p>Michelle was somehow fascinated about this plant, even though she had no idea what that plant actually was. When she wasn’t able to find anything on the net about such a plant, she thought that the seed may have been part of the meteor that had crashed down, but eventually, she dismissed the idea. Actually, she was right.</p>
<p><img src="/obrazky/prispevky/michelles-meteor-memento/michelle_s_meteor_memento_01_01.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Unfortunately, she found her job to be less interesting as it was before the meteor affair. The fact that the media had caused more trouble than the meteor itself had gotten to her. If she had been the anchorwoman she would have done everything to calm the masses down instead of increasing their fear. But Michelle only wrote some articles, she wasn’t allowed to present them. Michelle was 25 years old, 5’3” tall, near-sighted and rather plain looking. With this there were little chances that the young woman would ever be seen in front of the camera. Earlier Michelle had been fine with that but now she was demotivated and the work that once had excited her became a chore that she had trouble getting done. In order to counter her decreasing motivation she took a few vitamin pills every night right before going to bed. This night was no exception. She put her glass of water on her nightstand, right under the strange plant and opened the nightstand itself to take out her vitamin pills. For the few seconds that she was distracted, one of the buds moved over the glass and a small drop of a green liquid flowed out of it and dropped into the water beneath it. Michelle didn’t see that as she was just putting down her glasses. She sat down on her bed and swallowed her pills and drank the water and the green liquid with it.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for her to realize that something was wrong. She felt a strange surge going through her body and started to feel lightheaded. The dizziness grew and she fell onto her bed, hoping that this would help her recover.  Unfortunately it got even worse. Her vision became blurry, and her dizziness was replaced by pain, slowly turning into the worst headache she ever had. Michelle grimaced in pain and she closed her eyes in the process. It only took a few minutes, but for her it felt like a lifetime, until the pain dissipated and she was able to open her eyes again.</p>
<p>Michelle was surprised by the clarity of her vision. She could now see details on her ceiling that, she was sure she couldn’t make out even when wearing her glasses. As she got back up and looked around her room. It was not her imagination; her sight had suddenly gotten much better than she thought was humanly possible!</p>
<p>Michelle stood up and went to her full length mirror. Looking at her mirror image, the young brunette saw that her brown eyes had turned into a bright blue, almost as if her eyes were glowing. She felt another surge going through her whole body and into her head. Michelle wondered whether another round of dizziness and pain awaited her, but instead her hair fell out. She gasped in shock as she saw her hair fall down and looking at her arms, she saw that the few hairs on her arm had also fallen out. It was clear that any hair on her entire body had fallen out. Her improved eyesight revealed the fact that her arm now lacked hair roots. In horror the former brunette looked at her bald heads reflection and was relieved to find that there were at least still hair roots there. As if on cue, her scalp started to tingle and as she watched her reflection, she could see blonde hair sprouting from her head, growing at a tremendous rate. All the horror at seeing her hair fall out disappeared. Her old hair had been a mousy brown, while her new hair was golden blonde and seemed to emit the same strange glow as her eyes.</p>
<p>While her hair was growing, Michelle realized that her face was changing as well. Any imperfection was disappearing from her face and her nose slimmed down a little bit. She smiled at the mirror only to see that even her teeth looked perfect. “Wow, I’m … gorgeous,” she said to herself as if to confirm that what she was seeing was really her face.</p>
<p>When her hair stopped growing, it reached down to her butt. Somehow Michelle wasn’t surprised when another surge went through her body. It didn’t take long for her to realize what it did, she felt her legs and torso lengthen, causing her to grow in height. Michelle wondered why her growth didn’t hurt in the very least. In fact she enjoyed the feeling of her body lengthening. While her pajama didn’t feel tight, she saw how it became too short for her body. Originally her pajama pants had reached down to the floor, covering part of her feet when she lay in bed. Now the bottom part rose high above her ankles and was about to reveal her calves. Her pajama top didn’t look better; her arms grew longer, so they were only covered a little further than her elbow. Since her torso had grown as well, her belly was exposed a little further than her navel right now. And while it had been a little pudgy before it was now slim. When her growth stopped, Michelle thought that she should be at least 6’3” tall.</p>
<p>Michelle was overwhelmed with her new look, but another surge told her, that her amazing transformation wasn’t finished yet. This time it affected her whole body. The already thin woman felt the last of her body fat disappear while all her muscles started to grow. It felt even better than the last spurt. Michelle watched as her exposed belly turned into a six pack and saw her skin developing a nice tan as well. Her butt reshaped itself – becoming round and firm in the process. When the growth subsided, Michelle was a little relieved. She didn’t want to look like a body builder and was therefore happy, that she ended up looking ‘only’ like a fitness model – her poor pajamas stretched to its limits across her torso.</p>
<p>Just as Michelle thought that her transformation had finally finished, she felt another surge, this time going straight into her breasts. “Whoa…,” was all she could say, as her breasts started to expand.  The feeling of her breasts expanding was incredible. Her nipples became erect and pushed against the fabric of her pajama. While her previous spurts had lasted for about a minute, her breast growth happened much faster. Her pajama top finally gave in and ripped in front of her chest, allowing Michelle to see her new assets for the first time. She hurriedly took of the remains of her pajama top, while her breasts finished their transformation from As to DDs.</p>
<p><img src="/obrazky/prispevky/michelles-meteor-memento/michelle_s_meteor_memento_01_02.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>Michelle couldn’t believe it. In less than 10 minutes she had transformed into a living wet dream. She wondered if she was dreaming, since she WAS about to go to bed when this started. But it had felt too good to just be a dream. Michelle felt yet another surge going through her body. Unlike the other surges that washed over her body in an instant, this one went slowly. It couldn’t even be described as a surge, more like energy building up in her body. Once it had covered every part of her body, Michelle saw that her whole body emitted the same strange faint glow that her eyes and hair did.</p>
<p>This time, Michelle was right in believing that her transformation was over. She could still feel the strange energy and when she concentrated on that feeling, the enhanced woman realized that it was faintly getting weaker as time went on. Eventually it would dissipate and Michelle instinctively dreaded the moment this would happen. Somehow she knew that it was this very energy that had transformed her and if it dissipated, so would her transformation. She couldn’t explain why she thought that, but the more the young woman thought about it, the more she was convinced that her transformation was limited and that it would end once the energy was used up. But why would her body need the energy to sustain such a transformation in the first place? Unfortunately the answer didn’t pop up right in her mind, so all she could do was make the best out of it. She started to check out her new body once more.</p>
<p>Looking at her naked upper body, Michelle was amazed how her breasts didn’t sag despite their size. Sure, her pectorals seemed to be strong enough to easily support them, but still it looked like they actually defied gravity. She looked at the rest of her body, going over her six pack and her shapely legs – still clad in her pajama pants – down to her bare feet.</p>
<p>Michelle gasped as she arrived at her feet. What caused her gasp was not the fact that her feet, like every other part of her body, had been perfected during her transformation. No, that was something the freshly transformed girl was expecting. She gasped because her feet weren’t touching the ground anymore. Her body was hovering a few inches above it. It took a few seconds before Michelle had swallowed this new revelation. Her strange transformation had not only given her the most beautiful body she could imagine, it had also given her the ability to fly under her own power.</p>
<p>Seeing her feet dangling inches above the floor, Michelle couldn’t help but smile in joy. This made her rise a few more inches in the air. Michelle tried to control her new ability and found she could easily do so. Be it rising higher or landing on the ground, it was like she instinctively knew how to do it. She flew around in her room for a bit before landing in front of her mirror again.</p>
<p>Since her body could now easily pass as a fitness model, she wanted to see how a double biceps pose looked on her new body. When Michelle started to flex each biceps, she felt how the energy in her arms started to intensify. She watched as each biceps started to grow even bigger and the neighboring muscles joining them until her arms looked like they belonged to a bodybuilder – a male bodybuilder. Startled, she released her flex and felt her arms return back to how they were before. The young woman wondered how much strength she possessed. It wouldn’t surprise her to learn that she had super strength. The best way of finding out whether this was true would be testing it out, but she didn’t want to do that in her room. Michelle feared that she might break something if she really had super strength. So she decided to go out and test her body at a remote place.</p>
<p>This was a problem: the freshly transformed amazon had just ripped through her pajamas and it was obvious that none of her clothes would fit her anymore. While she looked around the room searching for something that could serve as clothing the strange plant on her nightstand caught her eyes. For some reason, it was glowing in a similar way that her whole body did. What’s more, Michelle was seeing that the glow was intensifying at its buds. Now it dawned on her. The strange glow she was seeing, was not visible by normal eyes, but was in fact the same energy that had also caused her transformation. She went over to the plant and after a closer look at its buds, she saw that they contained a liquid that glowed with the same strange energy. Then she saw the empty glass, still standing under the plant. Michelle put two and two together: she had drunk the liquid along with her vitamins and that had transformed her! That meant that she would be able to transform into a super powered goddess as often as she wanted as long this plant was alive and well.</p>
<p>But this didn’t solve the problem at hand: she still wanted to go out and try out her new super body. Then it hit her: why would Michelle ‘go’ out when she could fly? It was dark outside and nobody was watching the sky, so the fact that she was practically naked didn’t matter. Michelle took out a backpack and put some clothes in. Even if they wouldn’t fit her now, she wanted to make sure she had something to wear, in case her transformation ended before she returned home. She opened her window – thank goodness she was living in the third and uppermost floor – checked that nobody was outside and slowly flew out of the window and into the night sky.</p>
<p>Michelle couldn’t believe how good it felt to fly in an open space. Faster and faster she rose into the air. Soon the half-naked woman arrived high over the city where no mortal eye would be able to spot her. Flying across an open space felt totally different than what she did back in her room. It was a totally new sense of freedom. It felt like she was meant to live in the sky instead of the ground, even though she spent all her life living under the iron fisted rule of gravity. She changed her direction towards a mountain range and accelerated her flight. Michelle wanted to test out her bodies capabilities and thought it would be best to fly at top speed. While accelerating, the feeling of her super energy intensified mirroring her increased usage of said energy. Suddenly one of the mountains that had been miles away from her starting point filled her entire view.</p>
<p>Flying this fast, Michelle could neither stop nor dodge at this point. With a loud bang she crashed into the mountain. Michelle was surprised at the fact that the impact had barely hurt. She had been sure that she couldn’t possibly survive that crash, but after everything that had happened this night the idea of being invulnerable wasn’t too hard to swallow. Still she had expected that crashing into a mountain didn’t feel more painful than being showed against on the street. The young woman stood up and looked around; her crash had left a small crater. Luckily her backpack was still intact, though dirty. Her pajama pants on the other hand had been little more than rags after this crash. With a sigh Michelle ripped the remains of her pajama pants of her. “At least now I can see my new legs” she thought.</p>
<p>Spotting a large boulder, Michelle thought this was the perfect chance to test whether she really had super strength or all she could do was making her muscles grow. Grabbing the boulder was a challenge itself. She bent over and tried to get her arms around it, but the boulder was too big for that. Since it lacked any edges for her to grab, she just pressed her hands onto the boulder and tried to lift it. At first it seemed as if the boulder wouldn’t budge at all, but then she felt the familiar feeling of energy building up inside her and after a few seconds, she was able to lift it. “Yes,” she said as she lifted the boulder over her head, “I am super strong”. Even though her body was pulsing with energy, her muscles had not grown this time like they had when she had flexed them in front of the mirror. Michelle activated her flight powers and rose into the air – still holding the boulder. The extra weight made it harder for her to lift off the ground, but her body took care of that by using even more of this super energy which pulsed now stronger than ever. Michelle suddenly remembered, that the amount of energy she had was limited.</p>
<p>Not wanting to waste any more of her precious super energy, Michelle let go of the boulder and it landed with a loud thud on the ground. Still floating on the same spot, the new superwoman tried to categorize her energy consumption. Lifting the boulder had not used too much energy, but flying at the same time used at least 10 times more energy. As long as she didn’t move in midair, her body barely used more energy than it used automatically. Obviously the amount of power needed for flight varied with both speed and carried weight.</p>
<p>Landing gracefully back on the floor, Michelle wondered what other powers she possessed. She had confirmed flight, super strength and invulnerability as well as super eyesight. “If I can fly at such a high speed, maybe I can run just as fast?” she thought. Michelle remembered some scenes from TV where super speed resulted in the person running like a blur. But those were caused by special effects, how would real super speed work? The naked woman brought herself into a sprinters starting position. She concentrated on activating her super strength in her long, slender legs before pushing with all the strength her right leg could muster. Instead of pushing herself forwards she felt how her foot dug into the ground that gave away to the force applied to it. Dirt and debris flew behind her as her naked foot cut through the ground with little resistance. With her footing lost, Michelle’s first step took her “only” fifty feet forward where the loss of balance caused her naked body to fall down and slide over the unsteady ground for another ten feet. The dirt-covered woman rose back to her feet, knowing that her invulnerability had prevented her from being seriously injured. Her next attempt was much better than this failed experiment. Instead of accelerating as fast as possible, the naked amazon started with a light stroll down the mountain, slowly increasing her speed. Soon she was running faster than 200 miles per hour and she still had no problems with her footing. Michelle considered trying to run at full speed, but chose otherwise, feeling that her energy supply was nearing its end.</p>
<p>“Damn, it was just getting good” she thought. Looking back to where she had left her backpack, Michelle tried to test one more thing out. She bent her knees and tried to calculate the distance before she jumped of the ground. This time the young woman was prepared for the sensation of the ground giving away to the force she applied, before her body shot in the intended direction. At the peak of her jump, the young superwoman activated her flight powers directing her body towards her original landing spot where she picked up her backpack before flying back home. She didn’t fly at full speed since that would deplete her energy supply even faster With the velocity gained through her jump, Michelle had been able to build up speed and height with a lot less energy than flying alone would have used. She figured as long as the terrain allowed for her to use more force, this would be the most efficient way to travel. Her energy supply was big enough that she was able to fly all the way home and she still had some reserves when she entered her room. She was relieved to have some energy left, because thanks to her less-than-graceful landing in the mountains and her failed attempt at super speed, she was covered in dirt. Instead of leaving dirty footsteps on the floor, she hovered into the bathroom and took a shower.</p>
<p>While she was showering, Michelle was reminded of how different her new body felt. She quickly realized that she was much more sensitive than before when she felt the water run down her body. She started to ponder the events of the night, from her transformation to the discovery of her super powers to her test run in the mountains. Something great had happened to her and she would need to make the best of it. Once she finished her shower, Michelle laid down on her bed, waiting for her transformation to end. In order to speed things up, she started to hover above her bed. She looked into her bedroom mirror once more, seeing her super body in all its naked glory. Damn she was hot. With this body, she could easily have any man she wanted. Michelle wondered how sex with super powers would be like. Would there even be a man that could satisfy her? But then again she was much more sensitive now, so that wouldn’t be a problem, right? Her super strength might be a whole other issue no man would be able to withstand that, should she lose control.</p>
<p>What was she thinking? She had a plant that created super serum, so obviously she could turn the lucky man into a super stud that would clearly be worthy of her. She giggled, while starting to fantasize about the possibilities of having sex with an equally powerful partner. While her own flying powers alone gave several new opportunities for lovemaking, a partner that could do so as well would take the whole thing to another level – a level of their choice. The sheer thoughts of the possibilities aroused her and she absentmindedly started to massage her new breasts. The young woman was so aroused, that she wasn’t even surprised by how pleasant the sensations from her breasts were. If she was able to think straight at this point, she would have realized that she was already feeling better than during any orgasm she had ever experienced. With her pleasure building up, she slid one hand down to her wet pussy and began stroking it. Her fantasies about a male partner were washed away by the sheer amount of pleasure she was experiencing and it grew stronger at an even faster rate now. Michelle was totally incapable of a rational thought right now. She started to breathe harder. If any man – no any PERSON – entered her room and caught her attention the young goddess would have fucked that person literally into oblivion. Ironically, Michelle only emitted rather faint moaning noises so none of her neighbors were aware of her super masturbation. She squeezed her breasts with more and more strength while also fingering herself at increasing speed. As her pleasure was about to reach its peak, Michelle slowly rose even further from her bed. Then with a force Michelle couldn’t even begin to describe, she came. She opened her eyes wide and only saw stars, while the biggest orgasm in the history of humanity washed over her. The young woman couldn’t scream in pleasure, somehow her voice refused to work right now. Now grabbing her pussy with both hands, she was trying to make this moment of absolute joy last forever. For several minutes she succeeded, but eventually she came down from her height – in more ways than one, as she slowly drifted down to land gently in her bed. Her vision returned to normal, the ceiling replacing the stars she had seen.</p>
<p>For the first time since her transformation started, Michelle felt exhausted. She could barely feel any of the super energy in her body. Still, she was surprised that it had lasted this long, especially since her little excitement just now would have been a huge strain on her super supply. As the last bit of energy dissipated, Michelle stood up to watch her mirror image as her transformation reversed itself. Her body got shorter, her fitness model size muscles retreated inward and her breast shrunk back to their original size. Her hair shortened as well and lost its blonde color. The enhancements on her face disappeared as well as did her improved eyesight. In a matter of seconds, she had reverted to how she was before her transformation, a goddess replaced by a near-sighted mortal. Michelle looked at her blurry mirror image with a disappointed frown; secretly she had hoped that only her powers would disappear and that she would keep her gorgeous appearance.</p>
<p>A smile came over her face as she realized that this was a good thing. With the ability of turning from plain Michelle to a super sexy goddess and back again, she could lead a double life. All she needed to do was take good care of this mysterious plant and she could basically do anything she wanted. When Michelle stepped away from her mirror, something tickled her foot. She looked down to see that she had stepped onto the remains of her original hair that had fallen out during her transformation. “Wait a second” she thought, rushing to her nightstand to recover her glasses and returned to take a good look at herself in the mirror. She picked up a strand of hair and compared it to the hair still on her head. There was no doubt about it; her hair was different than before. While her original hair had been mousy and plain, her new hair even though still brown was full and lustrous. Speaking of hair, Michelle realized that she still had no hair on any other part of her body besides her head, maybe that change was permanent? And now that she watched her body with her glasses on, she could make out another difference: While she was never fat, she used to have a few extra pounds that now were nowhere to be found. The only body fat she found were her breasts which looked bigger now, but Michelle was sure that this was because her frame had become slimmer. Even though her super self was still way more attractive, she had to admit that she liked the new mortal her. As she suddenly yawned, Michelle was reminded at how sleepy she had been and turned to finally go to bed. Tomorrow was going to be a long day since she had some shopping to do – for both her selves. And of course she had to take her super body for another test ride…</p>
