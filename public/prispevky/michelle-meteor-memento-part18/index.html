            <p>&ldquo;So, all I have to do is drink that stuff?&rdquo; Miu asked. For someone who had been super before, the question felt utterly strange to anybody else in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Devil answered, before downing a small vial of her own. The impressive redhead didn&rsquo;t show any sign of change - but unlike Miu she was super already and was just increasing her supply this way.
Miu had never drunk a potion like this, but she understood that the other people in the room had gained their - temporary - powers that very way.
&ldquo;Alright, we&rsquo;re good to go,&rdquo; James exclaimed from behind a monitor. &ldquo;Take it whenever you want.&rdquo;
He was referring to the countless machines that Miu had been hooked up in advance. The scientists wanted to get as many readings on the transformation process as possible so they stuck pretty much all they could find onto her. This - of course - included cameras. And those made the young woman a little bit self-conscious. Miu had no problems in having her vitals taken as she was interested in the results as well. But right now all Miu was wearing were panties and a loose tank top that was supposed to withstand her post-transformation physique. In other words she was practically naked in front of strangers and cameras. The only thing that calmed her down was the knowledge that she would turn into a woman that didn&rsquo;t have to hide any of her super curves.
&ldquo;Ok then,&rdquo; she said to herself as she brought the vial with green liquid to her lips. Closing her eyes, she downed its contents in one go.
The first thing she noticed was the taste. It was great. She couldn&rsquo;t put it into words, as her tongue was experiencing a sensory overload. After all the liquid was full of super energy and any part of her that came into contact with it, absorbed it like a sponge. By the time the liquid had made it to her stomach, the super energy was everywhere but there. Miu could feel it seeping into her brain, then her scalp. Her thoughts began to travel faster, her mind becoming quicker and at the same time she felt her hair grow down her back.
Opening her now glowing green eyes again, Miu gave the camera a perfect smile as her improved eyesight examined the other people in the room. Unsurprisingly, Devil&rsquo;s body was filled with super energy, but not as much as Susan and herself had sported last night. In James she spotted a bit of super energy as well, despite him not being in his super form right now. The other scientist - Deziree - sported noticeable less power. Remembering Blue-Eyes words from last night, Miu wondered if men were really quicker to recover their own super energy.
Her attention turned back to her own changes which were happening faster by the second. Her arm, legs and torso lengthened in tandem while at the same time growing more muscular. After having spent most of the last night in this form, she considered this more to be her default form than the body she had been born with. The pleasure she felt in each and every cell as it was filled with the super energy was way better than her last transformation. Miu guessed that this must&rsquo;ve been because the power had come directly from Blue-Eyes who was something like a brother to her and thus didn&rsquo;t inspire any erotic feelings. The potion however did that - a lot.
&ldquo;Oh god,&rdquo; she whispered as the final phase of her transformation started. With her body full, the excess energy now pressed into her breasts, causing them to expand from their puny size to what she estimated to be a DD cup. Needless to say that it was one of the best feelings she ever experienced, and her body became weightless as she struggled to maintain her composure.
A few more seconds and it was over. Where before had stood a young unremarkable woman, was now a floating goddess with incredible powers. To empathize the difference, Miu started flexing - which caused her physique to explode to bodybuilder-like proportions for the moment.
&ldquo;Hope you liked the show,&rdquo; she mused as she allowed her body to relax again.
&ldquo;Well we got some good readings,&rdquo; James commented, as he rose from the table. &ldquo;And while we try to interpret them in the right way, I think it would be best for you to start the next test run.&rdquo;
He held out two wristbands with the letters &lsquo;GPS&rsquo; on it. &ldquo;These are the best trackers we have available right now. I&rsquo;d like you to put them on - along with a few mobile monitoring devices - and then have a little race around the world.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A flight race? Now that sounds way more fun that running on the treadmill,&rdquo; Devil commented as she took the tracker.
Miu had to agree, especially since this time the chances were much more even than before. Now with her being super as well, Devil would have a much harder time leaving her in the dust</p>
<p>Debbie couldn&rsquo;t believe her eyes: Right in front of her, laid a sleeping Michelle - several inches above the bench she should be lying on. The young woman couldn&rsquo;t believe her luck yet at the same time a barrage of questions went through her head: What else could she do? Was Michelle aware of these abilities? How had she gained them? How was she connected to the Angel?
The most pressing question however was whether Debbie should tell Michelle about her discovery once the latter woke up. After all, Michelle could be totally unaware about this and not believe Debbies words. Or she was aware and kept it to herself - a point Debbie understood quite well. In this case she might get more information by pretending not to know.
But for now she had a first row seat for the most impressive sight in the entire gym - and fortunately nobody else was there to witness it too. She checked thrice to see if there was something other than air between Michelle and the bench. Nope, this was not a trick. Michelle was hovering and judging by the slight smile on her face she was enjoying it too.
Debbie allowed her gaze to wander over her colleague&rsquo;s body. When she had returned to town a few days ago, she had been surprised to see Michelle looking better than ever. But she hadn&rsquo;t paid it too much mind. Back when they had changed into (and out) of their workout clothes, however she had already noticed that Michelle seemed a lot fitter than when she had last seen her.
And now she had a free view on Michelle&rsquo;s naked body. Usually she wasn&rsquo;t one to examine another woman&rsquo;s body like this, but given that it was capable of flying, Debbie made an exception. She remembered their earlier discussion about whether the incredible looks had been part of the Angel&rsquo;s powers. Had Michelle referred to herself there? While she was clearly more beautiful and fit than she was before, Michelle still didn&rsquo;t play in the Angel&rsquo;s league. But maybe Debbie&rsquo;s original assumption still applied and the Angel had looked like that even before she got these powers. Or at least good enough so that her empowering left her absolutely stunning.
In the end, Debbie couldn&rsquo;t answer any of these questions. As Michelle was slowly lowering to lie back down on the bench, Debbie decided to keep her discovery to herself. At one point Michelle might give her a bit of information that helps - and if she turns out to be unaware of her ability, Debbie can still tell her about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, I didn&rsquo;t expect them to be this fast,&rdquo; Deziree exclaimed as she watched the monitor. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re already in Europe!&rdquo;
&ldquo;The more interesting part is that Devil is still faster than Miu.&rdquo; James commented. &ldquo;Or rather that Miu is slower than I expected her to.&rdquo;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s flying a good Mach 33, how fast have you expected her to be?&rdquo; Deziree countered.
&ldquo;Devil is at Mach 35, I expected Miu to be about the same.&rdquo; James explained. Of course, the main reason for that was that he himself had managed the same speed last night - while being utterly outclassed by Michelle. &ldquo;Maybe Miu is subconsciously keeping herself back?&rdquo;
&ldquo;And why would she do that?&rdquo; Debbie raised her brow.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dancer who had been paralyzed for two years. Maybe she paid more attention to the fact that she could walk again rather than the newly acquired flying capacities.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hm, that could be a reason. But thenit would be a mental block rather than the lack of capability. We&rsquo;ll have to check the readings to see if she actually gave it her all. Until then we&rsquo;ll have to wait.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like we have a shortage of work to do. So what have you found out about this plant so far?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s still quite the mystery to be honest.&rdquo; Deziree began. &ldquo;The plant is quite resilient, but that was to be expected for it to survive the journey to earth on a meteor - even if it was just a seed. The really interesting part is - of course - the liquid it generates.&rdquo;
James nodded.
&ldquo;First of all the amount produced seems to scale with the amount of light and warmth it receives. Those seem to be more of a catalyst here. Like all plants it absorbs some of the light, but given the amount of energy stored inside this liquid, I have no idea where that comes from.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yeah, the energy required to lift aperson off the ground alone is more than such a plant could absorb from sunlight alone.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Exactly. But it also seems to react to human presence.&rdquo; Deziree continued. &ldquo;When left alone, the production would decrease after 12 and even halt after about 48 hours. Given that the liquid did contain some kind of retrovirus that is obviously responsible for the mutation after consuming it, it seems like the plant wants that to happen.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hm, interesting. It really seems like the plants consider it their way of reproduction if this liquid is ingested by other organisms.&rdquo;
James leaned back on his chair. So far their previous theories seemed to be correct. Apparently the plants had their own take on Darwin&rsquo;s Law and pretty much fused with whatever creature they encountered. The resulting hybrid would become superior to both races and the question was what would happen then. Would the hybrids make both parent races obsolete and go on to fuse with another race in the upcoming generation? That would mean that there were previous incarnations that may not have looked like the plants did.
&ldquo;I wonder what it&rsquo;s home planet looks like,&rdquo; Deziree spoke again. &ldquo;The wildlife there must be some sight to behold if the plants bestow this kind of power to any kind of creature.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It would also be one of the most dangerous places to go in the universe. Imagine wild animals with super powers, how would you defend yourself against that?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Carnivores are unlikely to consume the liquid,&rdquo; Deziree countered. &ldquo;But yeah I wouldn&rsquo;t bet my life on it. And thankfully traveling there is impossible.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hm that raises another good point: Would a hybrid be able to survive in space? Given enough super energy, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the lack of oxygen would be no problem either.&rdquo;
&ldquo;So I take it you didn&rsquo;t try that one out&hellip; then again neither did I. But speaking of which, what did you try out last night? After all you already know about my late-night visit here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, uhm&hellip;&rdquo; James blushed. &ldquo;We tested out to see how the super powers react to different genders. So far all we found out was that men seem to have more physical strength.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That was to be expected. But how is it with other powers, do you think you could keep up with those two when it comes to flying.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Actually I was more on Devil&rsquo;s level than Miu&rsquo;s here. So when it comes to flight there isn&rsquo;t much of a gender difference, just different levels of training.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Given the strength levels at play, the flight power would be the bottleneck in most confrontations. Yesterday the major part of the battle seemed to happen over the city instead of inside the lab.&rdquo;
James nodded, not wanting to admit that Michelle outclassed not only him but anybody else in terms of flight - which had been a factor in yesterday&rsquo;s fight with Ms. Harland. After a short while Deziree spoke again.
&ldquo;Just out of curiosity, did you look the same way the man Miu described did?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Uhm, yeah. Apparently there&rsquo;s not too much variation in terms of physique for supers.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call that a bad thing,&rdquo; Deziree mused her mind clearly drifting off with an awkward smile before she suddenly shook her head and regained her composure. &ldquo;How about capacity? I mean, it&rsquo;s clear where female supers store the excess super energy. But for men that&rsquo;s not an option. So unless there&rsquo;s some kind of alternative wouldn&rsquo;t men hit her maximum capacity much earlier than women?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Uhm&hellip;&rdquo; actually James had all but forgotten about this aspect. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t drink too much of the potion, so it&rsquo;s only natural that I didn&rsquo;t hit my limit. From what we know I wouldn&rsquo;t have turned back to normal if I did, actually. But you&rsquo;re probably right, all in all the capacity should be smaller for men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there something on my face?&rdquo; Michelle asked as she noticed Debbie staring at her. She didn&rsquo;t like that her colleague had suddenly decided to pay a lot more attention to her after they left the gym.
&ldquo;I was just surprised that you have quite the appetite today. Didn&rsquo;t remember you to be like that.&rdquo;
Michelle took another bite, giving her colleague a skeptical look. &ldquo;We were just in the gym, working out. Of course I&rsquo;m hungry afterwards.&rdquo; She was quite thankful that Debbie hadn&rsquo;t seen her for quite some time. This way the outward changes that Michelle had gone through in a few days, wouldn&rsquo;t stick out as much. Still, she was vary that Debbie might notice that her changes weren&rsquo;t exactly normal.
&ldquo;True, so you gave it your all in the gym, heh? That explains why you fell asleep in the sauna.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yeah yeah, it&rsquo;s dangerous to fall asleep in such a heat, I got it the first time around,&rdquo; Michelle said. &ldquo;So what are the plans for the afternoon? Roaming the streets again?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hm, let me check.&rdquo; Debbie took out her phone and went through her messages. &ldquo;Oh my god,&rdquo; she exclaimed after a while. &ldquo;Damn this could&rsquo;ve gone faster!&rdquo;
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Michelle asked, now curious about what Debbie had been texted.
&ldquo;Apparently the Angel fought another superwoman at a research facility nearby. The other superwoman was then arrested, but broke out of jail last night.&rdquo;
Michelle all but spat out her drink.
&ldquo;How had she broken out?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Through the outside wall. Guess that was to be expected from a woman that&rsquo;s super strong and can fly.&rdquo;
Not if she&rsquo;s out of power - Michelle thought to herself, but knew that Debbie had no means to know that. &ldquo;Well at least that means you&rsquo;re in the right city to find the Angel,&rdquo; she commented. &ldquo;Too bad the bad girl broke out, otherwise we could have interviewed her.&rdquo; Not that Michelle really wanted that.
&ldquo;True, but now we have a lead. The research facility was specializing in the meteor aftermath. If two superwomen decided to fight there, then it&rsquo;s obvious that there is something to be found there.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a point,&rdquo; Michelle admitted, not liking this turn of events. She should have expected for Debbie to catch wind of this incident. She just hoped that they would get chased off here.
&ldquo;Of course I do, so after we eat up we&rsquo;ll drive over there and see what we can find out.&rdquo;
Michelle bit her lip. There would be at least two &lsquo;official&rsquo; superwomen there along with two scientists who had been super too. Adding herself to it would make it the biggest amount of supers at one place so far, of that Michelle was sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright, that was number thirteen,&rdquo; Susan exclaimed. &ldquo;Guess you better take a break and recharge before we get to the rest of your one-night stands.&rdquo;
Blue-Eyes simply nodded in response before evaporating into thin air.
Using her tracking ability on him, she quickly found him a few thousand miles south - where the sun was the most intensive right now. It would still take a bit for him to recover enough.
&ldquo;Thirteen,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Seven out of thirteen. Not that good a rate.&rdquo;
What she was referring to was the amount of individual superpowers she had gained from the women Blue-Eyes had brought. By now she was doubting if the term individual was really fitting. Two of the women didn&rsquo;t have any special power at all, while others simply had developed the same kinds of powers unaffected by each other. Fortunately none of them had developed powers that made them immune to - or capable of - mind control. So there were now thirteen more girls that just thought that Susan was the best person in the world and who would do anything to please her.
The blonde goddess smiled. Her mind control was quite subtle, allowing the affected to remain their normal self. Only Blue-eyes had been damaged to the point that his personality was rather simple now. But he still proved quite useful.
Activating her X-ray vision, she spotted her new slaves together with Sandy and the men they had brought back last night hanging out at the pool. Where last night Susan, Miu and Sandy had to share the seven normal guys, these very same men had now two supergirls each: Sandy plus the thirteen newcomers. Susan feared that they might start to argue or even fight about them, but thankfully had ordered them not to cause a ruckus beforehand. What happened out there was pretty much just a pool party - but right now Susan didn&rsquo;t want to join in. She needed time to plan her next moves, so she teleported herself to a secluded place in the park she had visited often as a child.
In the blink of an eye she appeared in the park, instantly recognizing the place she had last seen over ten years ago. She had to giggle. As nice as it was to be able to fly, nothing was quicker than teleportation. Just as she was about to lean back in midair, Susan picked up a gulp somewhere behind her. Turning around in midair, she quickly spotted the culprit.
There was a guy sitting there, leaned to a tree with a sketchbook in his hands. He was staring at her with an open mouth, obviously still shocked about the stunning blonde that had appeared out of thin air. In terms of looks, he wasn&rsquo;t too much to speak of. He was wearing a washed-out T-shirt that depicted the diamond shaped S that was usually associated with Superman, but thanks to his scrawny physique made him look like a parody of the comic book character. The utter lack of super energy in him drove the point home that he was just a nerd.
&ldquo;And who do we have here?&rdquo; she asked in a condescending tone. It helped that she was still hovering several feet above the ground.
The guy just gulped again, and stared at her for a few more seconds.
&ldquo;I asked you a question,&rdquo; Susan added with pretended anger. Of course she could force him to act accordingly with her mind control, but a part of her liked his speechlessness way to much.
&ldquo;My n-name is P-P-Peter,&rdquo; he stammered after a while. &ldquo;Nice to meet you,&rdquo; he added with a blush.
&ldquo;Hello Peter, what are you doing out here?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Uhm&hellip; drawing,&rdquo; he answered blushing even further. His hands gripped the sketchbook tighter.
&ldquo;Oh an artist?&rdquo; she asked with a mocking tone. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m interested. I&rsquo;d really like to see your work.&rdquo; Susan held out her hand in demand of his sketchbook.
Peter looked at her in shock and shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that good to be shown to anyone … hey!&rdquo;
As he tried to clutch the sketchbook tight to him, it suddenly flew out of his hand and into Susan&rsquo;s, who then proceeded to open it.
&ldquo;T-telekinesis?&rdquo; he stammered, mostly to himself.
&ldquo;The candidate gets hundred points!&rdquo; Susan exclaimed as she stuck out her tongue. Then she focused on the pictures he had drawn. All of them depicted women lifting tanks, flying through the air and generally performing feats that she herself had thought impossible just a week ago. What stuck out was that these women were barely clothed. Those that wore a costume of sorts had it damaged to the point where their dignity was no longer intact.
&ldquo;You seem to have an interesting taste,&rdquo; she exclaimed with her usual mocking tone.
&ldquo;Uhm, well … you see&hellip; I … uh&hellip;&rdquo; The color of his face vanished and he clearly began to sweat uncontrollably. Together with his high pulse, Susan deduced that he was about to have a panic attack.
&ldquo;You ok?&rdquo; she asked with a much more friendly voice than she had intended.
Gulping, he seemed to get a hold on himself. &ldquo;This is just embarrassing&hellip;&rdquo; he whispered, blushing again as he noticed that Susan was still eyeing the pictures he had drawn.
&ldquo;They are quite good,&rdquo; she commented. &ldquo;How long do you need for one?&rdquo;
&ldquo;T-thank you&hellip; &quot; Peter actually managed to smile after the compliment. &ldquo;It usually takes a few days at least. Some of my better pieces took months to complete.&rdquo;
&ldquo;So, in other words, you have been drawing these for a while now. Not just since that other one appeared a few days ago?&rdquo;
Peter nodded, his face still crimson but his pulse seemed to have slowed down considerably. In fact, he became a bit more confident as Susan flipped through the book searching for those better pieces.
&ldquo;A-are you a friend of the … other one?&rdquo;
Susan glared at him, causing him to back away against the tree he had been leaning against.
&ldquo;I-I take this as a no,&rdquo; he quickly answered. &ldquo;Well you&rsquo;re a lot nicer anyway.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My, aren&rsquo;t you charming?&rdquo; Susan mocked him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost as if you knew that I could break every bone in your body with nothing but my pinky.&rdquo;
&ldquo;W-well, and then there&rsquo;s the fact that you&rsquo;re actually talking to me while she wasn&rsquo;t very talkative at all.&rdquo; Peter was obviously grasping at straws here.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t argue with that, although I&rsquo;m not really sure why I am talking to you, either. Maybe you should try to be a bit more useful for me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;U-useful? Do you want me to draw you or something?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Me posing for you? That would be the day!&rdquo; Susan burst into laughter, but quickly stopped herself when she noticed his disappointment. &ldquo;Ok maybe I&rsquo;ll strike a pose or two for you and you can make a picture out of that in my absence. But what I actually wanted was you knowledge on the issue.&rdquo;
&ldquo;What issue?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Super powers of course!&rdquo; Susan beamed back. &ldquo;You seem quite knowledgeable on that front.&rdquo;
Peter blushed again. &ldquo;Just because I have read a few comic books doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m an expert on super powers. Especially not real ones. Maybe you should seek out a doctor for that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;A friend of mine is already covering the scientific approach. But if you&rsquo;re not up to the challenge, I guess I can always find another nerd who&rsquo;s all too eager to help me.&rdquo; Susan turned around and began to hover away from him.
&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he blurted out. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I wouldn&rsquo;t try, did I?&rdquo;
Susan smiled to herself. She didn&rsquo;t need to use her mind control to make him do what she wanted. Facing him, she said &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; all while still smiling.
&ldquo;Yes, if you tell me how your powers work, I guess I might be able to draw some conclusions from that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And you probably want me to show some of them to you too?&rdquo; Susan teased.
&ldquo;T-that would be aweso… I mean helpful … yes, helpful.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then we better get started, shall we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean no press allowed?&rdquo; Debbie shouted. &ldquo;Seriously, I&rsquo;m not asking you to give us full access to the building, we just want to talk to one of your superiors.&amp;quot
&ldquo;And these superiors all decided that there should be no press here unless they ask for it,&rdquo; came the cold reply of the receptionist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but you two won&rsquo;t get an appointment today.&rdquo;
Michelle was quite happy with that development. She didn&rsquo;t really want for Debbie to find out about the events that had taken place here yesterday. What&rsquo;s more was that she didn&rsquo;t want Debbie to find out her boyfriend worked here. Michelle had refrained from telling her that because she would want to take advantage of this connection. Anyway the best outcome was that they wouldn&rsquo;t get past the entrance.
&ldquo;Is there a problem?&rdquo; came a familiar male voice. Michelle turned around to recognize Detective Jacob Spencer, who already flashed his badge.
Debbie however wasn&rsquo;t impressed. &ldquo;My partner and I are just here to get a statement about the incident that happened here yesterday.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And what would that incident be?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Some super chick attacks this facility, the Angel stops her. She gets arrested but breaks out later that night.&rdquo; Debbie explained.
Jacob&rsquo;s expression darkened at the amount of information Debbie just threw around. In doing so, however he fell into her trap. His expression showed anger rather than surprise which confirmed that he knew about this. At the same time the receptionist had remained quite calm – at least until Debbie mentioned Susan&rsquo;s breakout. Obviously she became nervous that another attack could happen again.
&ldquo;Listen, how about we sit down somewhere and talk about it. They won&rsquo;t receive you anyway.&rdquo; Jacob came up with a rather strange proposal.
&ldquo;I hope you have more to say than my contact,&rdquo; Debbie concluded.
Michelle however rolled her eyes. She wasn&rsquo;t off the hook yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like Miu really didn&rsquo;t give it her all,&rdquo; Deziree commented as she compared the readings they had gathered from their race around the world. &ldquo;At least in the beginning that is. Once you reached Asia you seem to have caught up to Devil in terms of speed.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t help me win the race,&rdquo; Miu commented cheerfully. &ldquo;Flying around the world in less than an hour is awesome enough as it is, no hard feelings if I take a few minutes more than Devil.&rdquo;
&ldquo;At least that confirms that the flying speed is about the same level per person.&rdquo; James concluded.
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing I don&rsquo;t really understand,&rdquo; Miu exclaimed. &ldquo;The two of you turned super yesterday, right?&rdquo;
Deziree and James shared an uncomfortable look. &ldquo;Yes, why are you asking?&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I think she means that you&rsquo;re already visibly regenerating the super energy while Dr. Archer is basically empty. I&rsquo;m actually a bit surprised that you didn&rsquo;t burst out of your clothes already,&rdquo; Amanda commented.
&ldquo;What? Is it really that much already?&rdquo; James acted surprised. &ldquo;Well someone showed me how to keep myself together like this, but I didn&rsquo;t expect it to be noticeable already.&rdquo; The truth was, that it had started rather slow and subtle, but the speed with which he regenerated had steadily increased.
&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s interesting,&rdquo; Deziree interrupted. &ldquo;I wonder why you are already regenerating and neither of us is. Maybe it depends on the gender, meaning that men regenerate faster than women?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s probably it,&rdquo; Miu agreed.
&ldquo;Or maybe he simply triggered this ability unlike any of us. Remember that someone made her first transformation permanent. If the regeneration also needs some kind of trigger, then it could have been plain luck.&rdquo; Amanda exclaimed.
&ldquo;And what could be that kind of trigger?&rdquo; Miu countered before facing James again. &ldquo;What did you do while you were super?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well…&rdquo; James blushed. &ldquo;Nothing out of the ordinary, I suppose.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need a bit more details than that,&rdquo; Deziree teased.
&ldquo;W-what am I supposed to say here? We had sex, okay? I&rsquo;m really not willing to go into every tiny detail about it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh but now we really want to know every detail!&rdquo; Miu joined in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had sex during my first time as a super too and it didn&rsquo;t cause me to regenerate at all.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Maybe it was because his partner was super too? Could that be a trigger?&rdquo; Amanda suggested.
&ldquo;That could be it. But in this case his partner would be regenerating too. Maybe we should ask her?&rdquo; Deziree proposed.
&ldquo;It may be better if I ask her myself,&rdquo; James tried to end this part of their conversation. He wanted to get Michelle as far out of focus as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously? This is barely more than what my contact told me!&rdquo; Debbie exclaimed after Jacob had finished his story. &ldquo;How did that other superwoman look like?&rdquo;
&ldquo;She looked quite similar to the Angel actually. The main difference was their eye color. This one had golden while the Angel has blue eyes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Even the physique?&rdquo; Debbie seemed rather surprised.
This conversation was a strange game of cat and mouse. Jacob was giving out his information in rather small packages and Debbie was always forced to ask for further details. It took a while for Michelle to figure out why he did that: he was trying to figure out Debbie&rsquo;s contact.
&ldquo;Yes, even the physique,&rdquo; Jacob answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen them both right next to each other, the only apparent difference was their eyes.&rdquo;
Michelle did her best not to blurt out anything. While it was true that Susan and she were looking quite similar, there were several small differences between them. She wondered if these outside differences were so small, that it took super senses to even recognize them.
Hey sweetheart, do you have a minute? James thought&rsquo;s popped up in her head.
For you anytime, she mentally answered. Any new discoveries?
Actually yes, that&rsquo;s why I contact you. How quickly do you regenerate super energy right now? Did it speed up since last night?
You could say that. This is the first time that I actually notice that my body recovers over the day. Before it was almost nothing. Why do you ask? Is it the same for you too?
Yes, which didn&rsquo;t go unnoticed by the other women here, especially those who can see it right now. We were wondering whether that was a gender thing or if the regeneration was somehow triggered. Since it&rsquo;s the same for you, it&rsquo;s probably the latter.
What do you mean triggered?
Well, we did redecorate that small island, you know? And we were both super at that time.
Michelle gulped at the thought of that. Had their lovemaking been the trigger? She had paid almost no attention to her supply back then. Still it sounded like a long shot.
Maybe it was something else? She mentally asked.
This is still just a theory, came the answer. After all it was the only thing out of the ordinary last night. To prove it we would need to test it.
Oh I&rsquo;m all for testing it once more, Michelle almost blushed as she thought back to last night. Detective Spencer gave her a curious look, but then turned back to Debbie to continue their game of cat and mouse. Pretending to feel hot, she looked through her bag for a small bottle of water.
Since we&rsquo;re already affected, the testing would have to be done by someone other than us.
Which would mean giving the potion to yet another person. I&rsquo;m not sure I like that.
It&rsquo;s not like there are plans for a test yet. But I guess someone will try it out eventually.
Their mental dialogue was suddenly stopped by the sound of a ringing phone.
&ldquo;Spencer,&rdquo; Jacob answered his phone.
Debbie turned around to Michelle, all but asking &ldquo;What do you think about that.&rdquo;
Michelle simply shrugged since she had barely paid attention to the last parts of their conversation. Right now curiosity got the better of her and she activated her super hearing in order to eavesdrop on Det. Spencer&rsquo;s phone call.
&ldquo;You wanted me to call you if there is a major crisis, Detective,&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s voice said through the phone. Michelle expected him to be a few years younger than Det. Spencer.
&ldquo;Already found something?&rdquo; Jacob tried to sound nonchalantly.
&ldquo;Yes, and truth be told I&rsquo;d rather not have heard about it either,&rdquo; the other man sounded clearly nervous now. &ldquo;Apparently there has been a security breach at the power plant. Some guy is on his way to the reactor core.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Are you kidding me?&rdquo; Jacob couldn&rsquo;t keep up his façade for long as he all but shouted into the phone. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t just walk into something like this!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Apparently this guy did. Trust me, I would consider this a joke too, but apparently this guy has super powers. I have no idea what he wants there, but it sure can&rsquo;t be good.&rdquo;
Jacob&rsquo;s face lost all color. &ldquo;Alright, I get the situation, I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rdquo; He was still trying to play it cool, but Debbie clearly didn&rsquo;t fall for that.
Call me! Michelle mentally ordered. I need a reason to leave here right now.
&ldquo;Excuse me ladies,&rdquo; Jacob began, &ldquo;I got to go now, how about we continue this discussion another time.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And what would that something be? It sure sounds important,&rdquo; Debbie countered.
Before Jacob could even try to answer, Michelle&rsquo;s phone rang as well.
&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Michelle pretended.
&ldquo;You need to slip out? What for?&rdquo; James asked on the other end.
&ldquo;What? … Really? … All right, I&rsquo;ll come ASAP!&rdquo; Those were the things Michelle said out lout while she mentally informed James about the call Jacob had gotten.
&ldquo;Sorry Debbie, private emergency. Gotta fly too.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; Debbie looked at her, upset. But her expression returned to normal almost instantly. &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s call it a day then.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you understand, bye&rdquo; Michelle shouted as she ran to the exit, barely caring about how weird her sudden departure must look to them. If the stuff she had heard was true, then this was one hell of a major crisis and she needed to hurry.
Once outside she quickly disappeared in the next best back alley and took to the sky once she was sure nobody saw her. Thank goodness she had some super energy at her disposal right now, otherwise she wouldn&rsquo;t even be able to interfere at all.
Seconds later she was at her apartment, stripping out of her clothes mid-flight as she quickly allowed herself to transform into her super form. With the super energy inside her already, the process was almost instantaneous. Michelle quickly hovered to her fridge and downed several doses worth of super potion - this could be another fight after all. One instant later she was out of her apartment, now dressed in her costume and flying towards the power plant in question.
From the outside, the power plant looked like it was business as usual, except for the alarm that was going off. Michelle quickly used her X-ray vision to find out where the culprit behind that had hidden. Thankfully, the thick walls and radiation shields didn&rsquo;t seem to affect her X-ray vision. Maybe she should find another name for that. The bigger problem was that she had no deeper knowledge about how a nuclear plant was designed, so she didn&rsquo;t know where to look at first. Then she realized that she should focus on the places with the thickest shieling - those were the ones where damage had to be prevented. Eventually, she found him in the reactor core, fiddling with the rods that were installed there.
Instantly Michelle made her way through the entrance. This was the reactor of a nuclear power plant, so it was no option to simply burst through the thick walls. Not even that guy had done it. Michelle had no other choice than to fly through the hallways as quickly as possible, hoping she would reach that man before he reached whatever he wanted. But what did this guy want? Judging by his physique he was super, so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to bother about the radiation but that didn&rsquo;t explain his intentions.
&ldquo;Reactors 1, 3 and 4 down, Reactor 2 on 25% output. Damn, he&rsquo;s messing with the control rods!&rdquo; a voice came out of several speakers that Michelle passed. As she rushed through the hallways Michelle found several members of the staff unconscious. From the looks of it they had been thrown against the walls with great force but otherwise the injuries seemed minimal. Or at least Michelle hoped so. She had not the time to take a close look at them, much less to do something about it. There were much more lives at stake than just them.
Following the trail, the culprit had left for her, she quickly reached what was probably Reactor 2. The man&rsquo;s physique reminded her of James after he had taken the potion and even the eyes were just as blue as his – or Michelle&rsquo;s own for that matter. Still, Michelle spotted enough differences in their faces and hair that she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to confuse this man for her boyfriend.
Michelle was relieved to notice that the man fiddling with the reactor core had less super energy at his disposal than she had. The relief was only short-lived since in that very moment, the man ripped the reactor core itself open, causing a cloud of steam to arise that Michelle was convinced to be radioactive. The man however didn&rsquo;t seem to care and it quickly became apparent why: Whenever he came into contact with it, his supply of super energy would increase a bit. He was absorbing the heat – and possibly the radiation - from the steam.
&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; she shouted, but the man didn&rsquo;t listen. Instead, grabbed into it and pulled out a few rods that he dropped next to the core. He repeated that for a few more seconds until he changed his mind and began to bend the rods that were still inside. A quick glance with her X-ray vision confirmed it: he wanted to fit inside.
But before he could put this plan into motion, she had tackled him away from the core.
&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m talking to you!&rdquo; she shouted again, hoping that he wouldn&rsquo;t turn this into a fight. But what stared back at her didn&rsquo;t seem very angry. In fact, this guy seemed rather confused by her interference.
&ldquo;Need to recharge,&rdquo; he said with a monotone voice. And just like that, he shoved Michelle away.
The force he used would have been strong enough to have her crashed against a wall, but Michelle managed to stop herself in midair about ten feet away. Still, this had given him the time he needed to get back up, and jump into the reactor core.
&ldquo;What is your problem?&rdquo; she asked as his head still stuck out of it.
He looked at her with a blank expression. &ldquo;Used too much power, need to recharge.&rdquo;
By now he was very well on his way to solve that problem. The boiling hot and irradiated water were like an all you can eat buffet to recharging his supply of super energy. Even from several feet away, she could feel her own body absorbing the heat and radiation, a pleasant distraction in a grim situation.
Michelle wondered how this guy had been smart enough to know that a nuclear reactor could indeed recharge them faster while at the same time, he sounded like a broken record. Something must be wrong with his head. The first thing that had come to mind had been Susan Harland&rsquo;s mind control shemes yesterday. But those had been rather tame and Michelle had even been able to counter them remotely in James' case. Whatever the reason, Michelle was convinced that things would go smoother, if she managed to get him to think normally again. But how? It had been her unique connection to James that had enabled her to free him from the spell that&hellip;
Her eyes widened. After her battle with Susan she had absorbed her remaining energy and gained her mind control power in the process. While she didn&rsquo;t like that particular power up, Michelle figured that it might help in setting his head straight.
Without a second thought, she stared into his eyes, and gave it a try. Focusing the super energy in her eyes, she tried to make a connection.
&ldquo;Get a hold of yourself!&rdquo; she ordered. There was a strange feeling in her mind, and Michelle was convinced it meant that it worked. Since it was subtle, she could even understand why Susan wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed using this power yesterday.
The man winced, as if he suddenly had a headache, but he quickly shook it off.
&ldquo;Wow, that actually helped,&rdquo; he commented, before giving her a sleazy grin.
&ldquo;Good, now get out of there!&rdquo; Michelle ordered, infuriated by his grin and not caring that she still had her mind control powers active.
&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; was all he said before disappearing into thin air.
Michelle looked at the reactor core in stunned silence. He had vanished into thin air! She smiled as she realized that she had resolved this incident without a fight. It made her feel all warm and fuzzy. Then she realized that it was something else that caused this pleasant feeling. With the man out of the reactor core it was her turn to recharge. And it felt really good to do so. She liked it more by the second
Her eyes widened as she realized what that meant. The core was getting hotter. When he was in there, this guy had prevented this by absorbing the excess heat, but now the chain reaction could go unhalted. Michelle reacted out of instinct. With him gone, only her own body could absorb the excess heat to prevent a meltdown. Without a second thought, she jumped into the reactor core.
&ldquo;Uhhhh,&rdquo; she moaned as the heat enveloped her. Her body reacted the same way it had done during the fire a few days ago: by transforming the excess heat into super energy. For a moment, Michelle allowed herself to get lost in the pleasant sensations that were caused by that.
After a few seconds she could feel the temperature decrease - and along with it the flow of power into her. Thanks to this, Michelle realized one big flaw in her plan: her limited capacity. No matter how much energy her body could store, the nuclear reactor produced much more than she could take.</p>
