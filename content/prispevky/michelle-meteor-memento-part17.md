Midnight was long-past but Miu didn't feel tired at all. Her body was still filled to the brim with super energy and the dancing she had done so far may have been beyond the capabilities of humans, but not enough to actually put a hole into her energy supply.
<!--more-->
Besides her one almost-crash with another woman, she didn't really have to use her super powers here and that was fine with her. Miu enjoyed the attention she was getting, but she didn't want to make it that obvious that she was more than human right now.
The late hour didn't go unnoticed on the other people in the club however, and Miu didn't want to let her opportunity slide again. She looked around at the men who had tried to impress her. Of course impressing a woman that could defy gravity, lift several tons and all sorts of other cool stuff wasn't exactly easy, but it took them a while to realize that. Now, only few of them still bore hope to actually approach her. It was time to pick the lucky winner, a decision Miu had avoided so far. Her last time with a man had been very bad for his health, and she felt wary of trying it again.
That's when she noticed him. Her unnamed benefactor had entered the club again. To her supernatural eyesight he stuck out in the crowd, since she could see the super energy inside him. She was about to ignore him when he beckoned her to follow. Now, that was odd. When he had left a short while ago, it had seemed like he would rather avoid any other meeting with her.
She turned to her admirers. "I'll be right back," and then made her way out of the club. Miu could practically feel the other guys noticing her blue-eyed benefactor and sigh in disappointment. These men had no chance in a direct comparison with him, so it was to be expected. After all they didn't know about their powers or how her ascension had turned her into a relative of his. When she returned, Miu decided, she would call him her half-brother. That was close enough to the truth to build up their hopes, in case they waited for her, that is.
For now she followed her benefactor into a small alley -- the same side street where she had turned from her normal self to the goddess she was now. The Asian woman smiled as she remembered that feeling. She wondered what he wanted from her, and then noticed that he didn't seem quite as powerful as before. Apparently he had exhausted the extra energy that the plant inside his body provided and now he actually noticed it becoming less.
"Is there something the matter?" Miu asked when they were out of earshot.
He only pointed upwards.
As Miu's gaze followed his direction, she spotted a woman that was just as filled to the brim with power as she was hovering above them. The other woman was blonde, with captivating golden eyes that were locked on her. For a moment, Miu thought that this must be the Angel that had been seen on TV, but then she remembered that the latter had glowing blue eyes. Thanks to the less-than-clear images on TV, she had no means of knowing how much further their similarity would go. Her outfit was different from the Angel's as well: She was wearing a pink tank-top and yoga pants that clung to her body like a second skin. Given her own experience with creating clothes, she figured that hers had been created, too. Her exposed belly with the defined six-pack and her overall flawless appearance made Miu a bit jealous of the hovering -- until she remembered that she played in the same league.
The blonde beckoned Miu towards her– and, after quickly checking that nobody could see her, Miu became airborne as well, and quickly crossed the distance between them. The other woman smiled at her, but at the same time her posture was commanding.
"Hi," she greeted with the sweetest voice. "Our common friend kept rambling about you, so I just had to meet you. I'm Susan."
Susan held out her hand and Miu shook it. "I'm Miu." Why did this woman make her feel nervous? It couldn't be her unnatural eye color; after all she had not felt so intimidated by Devil, whose orange eyes were just as unnatural. "W-why do you want to meet me?"
"Isn't that obvious?" Susan asked. "Because we're in the same boat and, apparently, you are quite knowledgeable about what happened to us."
Miu felt herself blush. "Aww, it's not that much, actually. I only had luck to meet someone who knew more about it than myself."
Susan smiled. "Which brings us back to why I met with you. You may know more than I do, so I'd like you to tell me everything that you know about it."
Her golden eyes glowed brighter as she said the last part, and Miu suddenly felt compelled to tell this stranger everything she had learned so far. She began to tell Susan everything she had been through regarding their powers. Starting from her first transformation, going over her revenge on her previous rapist, up to her encounter with Devil and Dr. Thompson. For several minutes she rambled, often interrupted by follow-up questions of Susan.
"So, the scientists are assuming that reaching your full capacity will mode-lock you?" Susan asked. "How did they come to that conclusion?"
"Devil only said that a friend of hers, the Angel, had figured it out. She didn't say how. But looking at our common friend down there, it seems logical."
"Have you reached your maximum capacity when he powered you up?"
Miu shook her head, wondering the same thing about Susan. "I stopped it right before I reached that level so that I can turn back to normal afterwards. H-how about you?"
"Oh, I hit the maximum capacity and didn't turn back to normal, which matches the theory so far."
"Sorry to hear that," Miu commented.
Susan just burst into laughter. "Why would you be sorry? Just look at us! We're much better than we were before and, instead of being easy victims, we can do what we want. I like being this powerful."
Miu didn't doubt the sincerity of that statement. "A-and what do you want?"
A naughty smile appeared on Susan's perfect face. "What do I want, indeed." Then her gaze went downwards to the club where Miu had been in just earlier. "I'd like to get myself a guy and then let him explore every inch of this perfect body as he treats me like the goddess I am! How about you?"
A gulp escaped Miu at the sudden exclamation. Her own plans were remarkably similar, and had mostly been thwarted by her fear she'd crush any would-be lover like she had done the last one. "W-well, that sounds nice."
"Alright then, it's settled." Susan exclaimed with a smile. In the very same moment, gravity suddenly reclaimed its hold on her and the blonde woman descended to the road. It took Miu a second to notice that Susan had done so on purpose, gracefully controlling her descent before landing on the asphalt. Miu quickly followed her and noticed that Susan grinned towards the road, or rather the dents her landing had left there.
"Blue-Eyes, we're going!" she exclaimed and Miu remembered that the two women weren't alone.
"Yes Mistress," came the voice of their benefactor whom Susan had reduced to his eye-color. Why was he obeying her like this? Right now he may have less power than any of the women, but nevertheless it had been him who had given them as much, after all. Then again, maybe he was just exhausted for once.
Getting back into the club was no problem for them. Both Miu and Blue-Eyes had been there before, and all that Susan needed to do was flash her golden eyes and she was allowed to enter.
Inside there wasn't much going on anymore. Miu should have expected this, given that it was the middle of the night on a weekday.
"You know these guys?" Susan asked as she gestured towards a group of men.
"They...– well, they tried to flirt with me before I left," Miu hesitantly answered.
This didn't escape Susan. "Is there something the matter?"
"I'm just a bit nervous. The last guy I was with was seriously injured because of my power."
Susan rolled her eyes, but then hesitated as she realized that it did indeed bother Miu. "Okay, let me help you a bit here. Look into my eyes!"
Miu was a bit confused, but did as she was told.
"You're confident when it comes to men since you know how not to hurt them during sex."
Her mood suddenly lightened, and Miu wondered why she had been so anxious just moments before. She turned around to the men and smiled.
"Still wondering if you should take one of these guys?" Susan asked again.
"Actually I'm wondering if we shouldn’t take all of them," was Miu's answer. "Those five are the best this club has to offer today, and I doubt one would suffice for any of us."
With a naughty smile Susan nodded.
As the Asian woman stepped towards the group of men, Susan fell back as she was still feeling the aftermath of her "assistance". Ever since she had figured that she possessed mind control powers, she had also noticed the slight pain in her head whenever she used it. This pain had grown quite big when she had turned "Blue-Eyes" into her slave. Susan had figured that this had something to do with him being super as well, and thus capable of resistance. Back at the lab there hadn't been any pain at all, but Susan had to admit her lack of attention back then. The total submission of Blue-Eyes had been enough of a struggle for Susan to not attempt a similar thing with Miu. It was much easier to have the fellow super girl assisting of her own volition.
That being said, lifting that mental block from the Asian had been quite the struggle for Susan, apparently Miu's resistance was growing each time Susan would overwrite her opinion. After a few seconds, her headache was gone however, and Susan could focus her attention on watching the outcome.

Deziree felt like she had barely fallen asleep when a sudden noise woke her. The first thing she felt was confusion. Confusion about her whereabouts, the noise that had woken her, and the strange -- yet somehow familiar feeling -- of something warm in her embrace. The noise, she quickly recognized as someone's mobile phone ringing, and when she heard a voice right next to her calling out, "Not now!" the mystery was solved.
Then, the memories came back to her. Her drinking the milk she had snuck out of the lab, transforming into a goddess of a woman and, through a strange string of events, landing in bed with Jacob Spencer, a man she had first met only this afternoon. Once the phone had finally stopped ringing, Deziree could feel his hand softly caressing her back, causing her to moan in surprise.
"Hm, you even sound different now that you're back to normal," he commented.
Deziree's face turned beet red at this comment and she thanked god for the darkness right now. He was right. Whatever power - and looks - she had before was now gone, only for plain old her to remain.
"Uhm... yeah," she muttered, feeling self-conscious right now. After all, her normal self didn't have much going for her in terms of looks.
"Everything alright?" he seemed to sense her insecurity.
"I'm fine," she lied.
"Really? You sound upset." By now he sounded fully awake.
"Well... it's just..." she struggled for words.
"You're afraid that I'll be disappointed by seeing your normal form naked?"
Deziree blushed even further if that was possible. "Y-yes."
"Don't worry," his hand now caressed her hair. "I was still awake when you turned back and there's nothing to be ashamed of."
"But..."
He sighed. "Look at it this way: You're an astonishing woman who was able to think clearly and react quickly in a situation that would've freaked out most people." He was referencing to her decision of sealing the plant and the super potion this afternoon.
"If I remember correctly my plan failed."
"And even then you made the best of it. Look, I'm just trying to say I asked that woman out, not the larger-than-life goddess you turned yourself into afterwards."
"Aww, you're too kind." Deziree leaned in to kiss him. "But you didn't seem too opposed to that goddess, either."
"Since it was you, how could a mere man like me resist?" he joked before kissing her again.
"Hm, you know I still have more of that stuff here..." Deziree felt herself getting more and more aroused. "E-even some that would work on you..."
"Let's save that for later," he whispered into her ear. "Right now I want to make love to the real you."
Deziree tried to resist, still struggling with the fact that she was normal -- and tired -- right now. One kiss later though, she felt tiredness being washed away by the rising passion inside her. Her body was suddenly providing reserves she hadn't known to be there. Before she knew it, she had fully joined in.

"Come on, push harder!" Michelle cheered.
"What do you think I'm trying to do here," James answered.
But it was of no use. The pain in his cells eventually overwhelmed him, causing him to even stop trying in order to take a short break as he landed back on the ground. Not too long ago he had doubted that a superhuman could even feel pain, but now he knew from experience that overexertion had the same effect on him with powers as it would have without. The only difference was the point at which his body reached the limit.
"What happened to being 20% stronger than me?" Michelle teased, descending but not touching down on the ground.
"That only applied to physical strength," he replied.
In between their lovemaking, Michelle and James had taken short breaks in which they tested out the limits of their powers. Apparently his personal power was to determine the right numbers with no measuring equipment whatsoever, from the speed with which they had traveled to the remote island, to the weight of anything they found here. Since they had exchanged their super energy before that, this power was no longer exclusive to him, either, and he now had the same extra powers Michelle had accumulated over time. Compared to heat vision, mind control or Michelle's mind melding, him being good with numbers sounded like the nerdiest superpower ever. But still, it had its use in determining what they could and couldn't do.
One of these discoveries had been the amount they could lift, and the result had been a short boost of James' ego. He could lift a bit more than 300 tons in his current form, whereas Michelle's limit was about 250 tons -- leaving him with the aforementioned advantage of 20%. Personally, James preferred the absolute numbers. 50 tons simply sounded better than being 20% stronger. And that was as far as the ego boost went here. James was aware that the strength difference was about 50% between the average woman and the average man. This difference had decreased significantly when both were super. Moreover, with Michelle having been rather weak as a human and him in rather good shape, the loss of a strength advantage may have been even higher.
Their current test, however, had made it obvious that his advantage in physical strength wasn't worth as much as he'd have liked it to be. After all, in order to apply this level of strength, one needed an equal footing. If Michelle's fight with Susan Harland had proven anything, then it was that this footing wasn't found in the floors and walls of buildings, but in their very own flight powers. And on this front, James knew he had no chance of coming out on top. Michelle's stunt with the plane had significantly increased her capabilities there, being able to lift about 100 tons and still being airborne, while James barely managed half as much.
This had led to the point where Michelle wanted to train James in order for him to catch up. The exercise seemed simple enough. Michelle would anchor herself in the air while James would have to push with all his might to move her.
"Still, you should be able to move me at least a tiny bit," Michelle summed up the situation. "I mean I can feel that you're getting better at this, but it feels a bit slow."
"Yeah, it does," James had to agree as his body recovered from the strain. "Maybe it's because you had more super energy at your disposal as you went through this? We're about to run low, after all."
"Maybe," Michelle exclaimed, sounding disappointed. "I just wished we could've done more..."
James raised his brow. "More than this?" He looked around the small island that was barely recognizable as the tiny paradise they had found here a few hours ago. The combination of superpowered lovemaking and testing their power in between made it resemble a battlefield.
"Uhm, yeah," she blushed as she as well became aware of that destruction. She then hovered into his arms. "It was such a nice night. But I guess even the best nights have to end eventually."
That sounded odd, given that the sun had risen a few hours ago on the island. Thankfully, that was caused by the time difference, and it would still be early morning at home.
"We can come back here tomorrow night and continue with a bigger energy supply."
"Hm," she leaned in for a kiss that made him airborne again. "I would like that."
"But first we'll need to get to our work day. Maybe I'll have some interesting news for you after that."
"Yeah," she smiled back as they left the island. "With other supers willing to help you with your research things should go quickly," she mused. "And hopefully you won't have any unpleasant surprises today."

Miu opened her eyes to the first rays of light. It took her the fraction of a second to remember where she was and how she had gotten here. The Asian goddess smiled as she looked around to find Brad, Tony and Jonas sprawled all around her. They were all sleeping soundly. Miu giggled as she took the only way out that wouldn't disturb their sleep -- hovering above them. Of course these guys were exhausted. After all, they had spent the last few hours giving their all to please her -- and boy, had they succeeded. Miu blushed as she touched down on the floor, her naked body still brimming with energy, while her three lovers were taking a well-deserved nap.
The room they were in belonged to a large estate owned by Jonas. It had been quite luxurious in its design, showing that their host had more going for him than just his good looks. Right now, however, the room was a mess. Miu had been quite the wild lover, and more than once her super strength had proven fatal to the furniture. She looked at a marble globe, easily three or four feet in diameter, that had probably been quite expensive. It had been shattered when one of her orgasms made her throw her head back with too much force.
Miu absentmindedly ran her hands through her long black mane and removed a few bits of marble that hat been stuck there since then. Despite the destructive effect she had on the furniture, Miu had somehow prevented herself from hurting her lovers. Those three may be tired beyond imagination, but they hadn't received a single scratch.
"Guess none of you is in the mood for breakfast yet," she giggled as she materialized herself a basic outfit consisting of a tank top and short workout pants. With her modesty being taken care of she stepped -- no, danced -- out of the room. The estate was bigger than she had remembered, probably because she hadn't cared about that. Still the entrance hall was quite something with a long, winding stairway and a big chandelier in the middle. Miu took the opportunity to fly upwards to take a close look at the chandelier, only to note that it wasn't made of solid gold, but rather had a small layer of it for looks sake. Nevertheless their host was loaded, but then again, they had asked the guys about who had the biggest place and come here because of that.
Once again landing on the floor, Miu made her way to the kitchen.
"Good morning, sunshine," Susan laughed as Miu entered. She was sitting at the table, a mug of hot cocoa in her hands, wearing a fancy morning robe that she had must've gotten from somewhere in the house.
Sitting next to her at the table was another woman, with strawberry blonde hair, a killer figure and the signature glow of super energy right underneath her skin. This glow was a lot less intense than the one coming from Susan or herself, indicating that her supply of super energy was a lower than theirs. This was only natural as Miu herself didn't have much more power her first time around either. She looked at Miu, grinning as she realized that the Asian supergirl was checking her out.
"Looks like someone had a makeover. You look good Sandy," Miu exclaimed, thankful that she remembered the other woman's name. They had picked her up last night so that Blue-Eyes could have some fun as well. And obviously, he had turned her into a superhuman just like he had Miu and Susan before.
"Thanks," the other woman proudly answered. "I'm still getting used to it, but Susan has been so kind to fill me in on things." She hugged the blonde fellow goddess as if she was her best friend, not some random stranger that had picked her up last night just because.
"Aww, it wasn't that much, Sandy!" Susan joked before returning her focus on Miu again. "So am I right to assume you had some fun?"
"You most definitely are," Miu said as she took a seat on the kitchen table as well. She noticed that Blue-Eyes was there as well, occupied with preparing the breakfast. Something about this behavior felt strange to Miu. When they had talked yesterday, he hadn't seemed like the kind of guy who'd do that. But then again she didn't know him that well.
"Oh yeah," Sandy added. "You definitely sounded like you had more than a bit fun."
Miu blushed. "W-was I that loud?"
Both Susan and Sandy nodded in unison.
"There's nothing to be ashamed of," Susan exclaimed. "I think we all had our share tonight."
"You're just jealous that she had three guys all for herself," Sandy giggled.
"I would've had four if a certain someone hadn't teleported herself right into the middle of it!" Susan countered.
"You were greedy and I was needy," Sandy stuck out her tongue only for Susan to roll her eyes. Apparently she wasn't as mad about that as she pretended.
"Wait a second... teleported?" Miu interrupted.
"Yeah, it's kinda..." Sandy began only to disappear from her place.
"...My thing," came her voice from right behind Miu's right ear.
Startled by the sudden voice, Miu lashed out, her hand finding Sandy's face. A split second later the kitchen cabinet behind Sandy was crushed as the latter crashed into it.
"Oh my god," Miu shouted as she realized that she had slapped the other woman with way too much force. "Are you hurt?"
"Didn't feel a thing," came the answer from a surprised Sandy, who simply disappeared from the rubble and reappeared on her seat. "This invulnerability bit is really awesome."
"The accidental use of super strength, not so much," Miu commented. "But I get that teleporting bit now."
"You're just easy to scare that's all," Susan commented. "But you should've seen the guys' faces when she did that last night."
"I guess they were just as scared at first as I was, just less... forceful."
"At first, yeah. Didn't help that she suddenly appeared right when we were at it. Then again, there suddenly was a second supergirl for them to please, so of course they liked it." Susan explained.
"I can imagine that," Miu answered.
Blue-Eyes was now delivering the first round of waffles and the girls quickly dug in. Once she took the first bite, Miu realized two things: First, her sense of taste had been amplified along with the rest of her body. She had suspected this already yesterday in the club with the drinks there, but hadn't tried it with actual food. Second, Blue-Eyes’ cooking skills were mediocre at best. She looked around and noticed both Sandy and Susan having a surprised look on their faces as well. Apparently they were making the same kind of discovery right now.
"So, what are your plans for today?" Susan asked around.
"Hm?" Sandy seemed caught off-guard with this question. "Well I've got lectures later, but until then I'm free." She then looked at Miu. "How about you?"
"Well, I kinda planned to visit this lab where they researched the meteor aftermath. The scientist I met yesterday seemed quite knowledgeable about what's been going on with us. Maybe you should join in? The more the merrier."
"I don't think it would be a good idea for me to go there," Susan answered.
"Why not? You're just as curious about it than I am," Miu pushed.
"That may be true, but for me that's not an option," Susan sighed. "My last trip there didn't exactly go well, and I doubt they would be as helpful to me as they would be to you."
Miu remembered James' comment about the 'argument' of the last two superwomen at the lab.
"So, how should we proceed?"
Susan leaned back, obviously thinking for a second. "Well... how about you go there, talk to that cute scientist you mentioned, and get whatever information they have to offer. You just leave out any part about what happened last night, like meeting Blue-Eyes and me."
"What about me? Should I accompany her?" Sandy asked. "That whole thing sounds really interesting."
"I don't think that’s a good idea," Susan interrupted. "They already know Miu, but when they last saw her, she didn't have powers or the ability to create other supers. So it would be strange for her to bring another one."
"I did find Devil in that bar, too. And besides, it's hard to hide the fact that I found a power source the way I am now, isn't it?"
"You'd have to transform back to normal to pull that off, obviously."
"What?" Miu almost shouted. "G-give all this up?"
"It's only temporary, of course. You'll turn back to normal, go to the lab and help them with their research. They do have some of that super stuff there, so maybe they'd even give you some as part of the tests. If not, that Devil woman will be there too, right? She might share some of hers with you as well. And if that doesn't work out, you can still ask Blue-Eyes to power you up once you're back."
Susan gave Blue-Eyes a stern look to which the latter quickly replied, "Yes, sure; I'd power you up anytime!"
Miu pondered the idea. Susan had a point there, but at the same time she was nervous about giving her new abilities up even for a bit. It simply felt too good. She looked at Blue-Eyes and confirmed that he had already recovered some of the super energy he had given to the three of them. Especially since the sun hadn't been up for that long. Would she be able to recover that quickly eventually?
"Alright, I'll do it." After seeing Susan smile, she added. "What are you going to do?"
"Me? I'll do my own research of course."

"You seem nervous," Jacob exclaimed as his car was finally getting back into view. He was lucky that Deziree's place wasn't too far from his and, rather than having her take the bus to work, he insisted on driving her. After all, his job would lead him exactly there anyway.
"Well, I had some kind of super makeover last night, and for once don't want my colleagues to notice that!" came the answer.
"You look great," he assured her.
"And that's the problem," she sighed, rolling her eyes. "Guess it's my own fault. I should have considered that I'd still look different from before after going through such a life-changing event."
"The difference isn't too big, I doubt anybody who didn't pay attention to you before would notice that."
"Do you notice it?"
"Yes; your skin is smoother, your hair is silkier, and all the bruises are gone. Fortunately, I was one of only few people who even knew about the last." Jacob knew that he'd better explain himself right away or Deziree would freak out even more. "Look, there's probably a lot of women who were in the same situation as you right now and nobody has ever been reported to the police because they looked good."
She looked like she wanted to protest, but decided against it. "I guess you're right. But what about someone like Dr. Thompson? He'll probably figure it out if I run into him."
"That won't be a problem as long as he doesn't tell anybody else, right? I doubt he'd sell you out if we tell him right away. And it'll be easier to figure things out if you cooperate."
"He didn't seem too interested yesterday. Whatever issues he had with his girlfriend yesterday, he’d better sort them out ASAP."
Jacob was about to answer when his phone suddenly rang. Come to think of it, he had ignored it earlier, so he picked it up.
"Spencer," he said with a smile.
Deziree watched him as this smile faded, replaced by concern.
"She what? That should've been impossible. Okay, I'll keep my eyes open."
"Something the matter?" Deziree asked once he hung up.
"Ms. Harland broke out of prison."
Memories of yesterday flashed through her head. "H-how?"
"Apparently she ripped a hole into the wall and flew out into the night."
"That’s... impossible! She was depowered!"
"The surveillance feed shows that she was talking to someone before leaving. Unfortunately that other person can't be seen. Whoever that was must've been super too, making finding her tricky."
"As long as she doesn't try to find us again..." Deziree said absentmindedly.
"Don't worry about it. I don't think she's that much after you, or any of us, to risk being defeated again."
"Yes, but it was also by pure chance that the Angel showed up when she did," Deziree retorted.
"That's one thing that has been bugging me," Jacob thought aloud. "Her appearance was quite convenient after all."

"You're late!" Debbie exclaimed as Michelle entered the car. "Did you bring everything?"
"Yeah," Michelle answered. "I've got my workout clothes right here," she held out her bag before she threw it on the backseat. "Now could you explain why I had to bring these?"
"Duh, we're going to the gym, of course!" was all Debbie answered.
"Good thing we're not going to a wedding reception with these," Michelle exclaimed as she rolled her eyes.
The sarcasm seemed to work.
"Okay, look at it from this angle: If you suddenly had super powers, where would you go?"
"Probably somewhere private," came Michelle's answer. After all, that was how she had done it.
"And once you figured out that you are faster and stronger than any human, what would you do?"
"Obviously not work out in a gym that has no weights fit for this kind of power!" Michelle exclaimed. "After all we're talking about lifting-a-plane-strong."
"Yes, a gym wouldn't be good for an actual workout, but there's more to that," Debbie began. "A gym is perfect to show off these powers."
"From what I can tell the Angel isn't much of a show-off, or else she would seek the next best camera, right?"
"The Angel may not be like this, but other people in the same situation might be. My gut tells me it's worth a shot. The chances may be slim, but that's still better than running around with no further plan."
Michelle had to admit that this made some sense. This was mostly because there were indeed other supers out there, and judging by the number of them James had encountered in a bar yesterday, the number was growing quicker than expected.

"This is getting boring!" Sandy exclaimed after she missed Susan for the tenth time in a row.
The two superwomen had been playing a game of tag that involved teleportation. Susan had suggested it after Sandy had given her a bit of her super energy -- and the ability to teleport along with it. And the reason was plain and simple: to exercise this new power.
After a while Susan had found out the rules behind teleportation. In short, she was able to switch places with any non-organic matter that was where she wanted to be. For most of the time this meant air, but they had also tested out what happened when something was in the way. Susan had burst into laughter as Sandy had teleported underground, leaving a Sandy-shaped figure in her place that quickly collapsed into a pile of earth and dirt that it was composed of.
Organic matter, however seemed to block the teleportation in most cases. I was impossible for Sandy to teleport into a tree - not even partially - probably because that would have destroyed said tree. The same rule applied to animals - at least the bigger ones. When Sandy had teleported underground, she had unwittingly teleported a bunch of bugs and worms in the earth she had switched places with above ground. So Susan had concluded that it was impossible to hurt anybody with this particular power.
Sandy's frustration however, wasn't based on these discoveries. The game of tag they had been playing had started out with her in the lead, but Susan had soon caught up and was now outmatching her -- the very person who had developed this teleportation power in the first place.
"You're not concentrating enough," Susan exclaimed, dodging Sandy's attempt to tag her by teleporting out of the way in the last moment. Sandy quickly found Susan's new position and tried to teleport herself behind the blonde, only to grab thin air once again.
"How is it that you know exactly where I am?" she finally asked.
"Well, we've got more than one superpower," Susan teased as she closed her eyes, teasing the fellow ubergirl to try again. She could sense the hesitation in the other woman, her hovering in place before suddenly disappearing for another attempt. Susan wasted no time and teleported out of the way leaving Sandy to grab thin air again.
Sandy remained in place. Instead of getting frantic, she had decided to calm down and think. Susan was tempted to open her eyes to see what exactly the other woman did, but she kept them closed. Instead, she focused solely on the tracking ability she had gained from Miu.
Now Sandy teleported again, appearing just left of Susan, who just barely teleported away again -- only to feel Sandy tap her shoulder right away.
"You're it," the other woman said.
Susan gave her a wicked smile -- a smile the other woman couldn't see because she had closed her eyes like Susan had. Before leaving, Miu had given almost all of her super energy to Sandy, leaving her with the same tracking ability. And now Sandy had finally begun to use it, catching up to Susan once again.
Their game continued for about half an hour, after which neither of them made any noticeable progress anymore. That was only half the reason they stopped, however. Both Susan and Sandy had quickly learned that this constant teleporting burned through their energy supply quite fast.
So Susan decided to do something less energy-consuming next. Both she and Sandy returned to the villa they had spent the night in. The men - were still out cold, with the sole exception of Blue-Eyes, so the women settled down next to the pool.
"Now that's more like it," Sandy exclaimed as she lay down, turning the clothes she had created into a very revealing bikini.
Susan did the same, but wasn't really thinking about lazing around. She had noticed how quickly Blue-Eyes was recovering his super energy. Knowing that it was created through the absorption of sunlight, Susan had told him to sunbathe while they were out. It had clearly paid off so far, with him being almost full himself already, so he would soon start charging up that plant inside him.
The girls hadn't this level of regeneration yet, but Susan wondered if she could speed things up. She concentrated on the sunlight on her skin and soon noticed that the warmth of these rays was accompanied by another sensation. Yes, her body was recovering the super energy.
For the next half hour Susan tried to somehow affect this process. Unfortunately she could neither slow it down nor speed it up. After some time, she became frustrated. She opened her eyes again. Next to her, Sandy had already become bored and was trying to balance a huge stone on her finger. She was pretty close to succeeding as well. Her energy regeneration however was the same as Susan’s - except that she used up a bit more right now.
On the other side of the pool,? Blue-Eyes seemed to have dozed off, but the fact that he was sleeping didn't seem to affect the speed with which he regenerated the super energy either. Susan bit her lips. So far only time seemed to work when it came to regenerating super energy.
Closing her eyes again, Susan recapitulated the last 24 hours. Her fight with the Angel had shown her that knowledge over these powers was a lot more important than the raw energy that allowed them to use it. After all, the Angel had less than half her capacity when their fight started and she had beaten Susan despite the latter maxing-out during the fight.
Of course there were also positive effects to consider here. The fact that she had mode-locked herself in this killer body for example was a good thing for her. Not to mention the increased control over her strength she had acquired during the fight. There was also the awareness of her very own special power: mind control.
She had to smile as she thought about that. Both Blue-Eyes and Sandy were only in her presence because Susan had tampered with their minds. Blue-Eyes was now her loyal servant, although he seemed to have lost quite a bit of his personality along the way, an unfortunate side-effect of having tried to resist her brainwashing. As for Sandy, Susan had made the necessary arrangements before the latter gained super powers. The outcome was nice, to say the least. Sandy now viewed Susan as her BFF, while she still had her own personality fully intact. Susan had feared the other woman might break out of this control after becoming super, but apparently this hadn't affected her. When asked to share some of her energy so that Susan could use her personal power as well, Sandy hadn't even considered asking for Susan to return the favor.
The whole thing about these personal powers seemed strange. They weren't really special if they could be shared as easily, but they sure were helpful. She wondered how many different abilities actually existed. It wasn't like there were hundreds of supers out there for her to make a better picture of it. And the ones that were out there were depowered and couldn't be tracked down with Miu's ability since Susan had never met them. They had only met Blue-Eyes after all, when he had turned them super just like Miu, herself and Sandy.
Susan opened her eyes as she put two and two together. In one swift moment her body lifted off the lounger and flew over to Blue-Eyes.
"Hey! Wake up," she commanded.
"Hm?" he asked, apparently not as deeply asleep as she had expected. "What do you want, mistress?"
"You tracked me down yesterday in order to get my personal power, right?"
He nodded.
"You can also track down any of the women you turned super before, right?"
Another nod.
"Good!" Susan exclaimed. "I'd like to meet them!"

"Now that's a big hole," one of the scientists exclaimed as he saw the shredded vault door. "What kind of animal could have done this?"
"What makes you think it was an animal that did it?" another one asked.
"Because of the claw-marks, of course."
"If those were claws at all," James interrupted the discussion by stepping closer to these marks. Putting his fingers into it, he noticed that they were just a bit too wide to fit in, but the size was close enough. "I can almost put my fingers inside these marks, so I think it's save to assume that it weren't claws, but fingers that did it. I'd say that this is probably the work of a superpowered woman."
"Which is pretty obvious actually. Why did you even consider an animal?" the second scientist teased. The first one didn't find any words to answer this.
"Maybe because whatever can give a woman the ability to lift a plane or rip this door apart can probably do something similar to an animal," came the voice of Deziree Archer.
James turned around to look at the woman and immediately noticed the slight changes in appearance she had compared when they had first met yesterday. Back then James hadn't paid too much attention, and fortunately neither had any of their colleagues. Even more fortunate was the fact that he was also the only one that knew that she was thrown around the hall, and thus should have been bruised at the very least. Those wounds were gone, along with quite a few other imperfections on her appearance. Of course, she wasn't the supernatural woman going by the less-than-creative name Desire anymore, but for those who knew the rules, it was pretty obvious that she had been.
Of course, James could understand that she didn't really want to rub this aspect into anybody's face. Especially not considering that she was the one who had ripped open the vault door and stole what had been stored in there. The way she looked at him made it clear that she was afraid that he had figured it out. Fortunately he had no idea to sell her out like this.
"Dr. Archer," said Prof. Smith, their superior. "Was there anything in there besides the containers you sealed away?"
"Not that I know of."
"Anybody else?" he asked around, only to be met with shaking heads. Apparently none of the other scientists had deemed anything dangerous enough to be stored there.
"I see. Do you have any idea why someone would want to do that?"
"Actually I have," Deziree began. "The plant’s genetic makeup seems identical to the changes undergone by Jane Doe and Mrs. Riley. I assume that this may be the cause of the mutation -- and probably the super powers, too." She also added a brief explanation of her encounter with Ms. Harland where the latter actually drank a good amount of a third container. "The Angel took what's left of the third container with her," she concluded.
"Hm, that indeed makes it pretty likely that the liquid was responsible. We should verify this ASAP. Do we still have some of that stuff here?
"The plant is here and it still produces the liquid," Deziree assured him.
"Good, make sure to compare it with the mutated women. We need a verification as soon as possible. Given the issues with Ms. Harland, I think it would be better for you to refer to Dr. Thompson for that."
James was a bit surprised by this decision, but in hindsight he should've seen it coming. Cooperating with Deziree would be the best way to get more insight on the plant. The downside was that it was only a matter of time until she found out that she wasn't the only one who had taken a sip of that liquid here. Well, he was sure that she wouldn't sell him out.
The distinct sound of his own phone broke this train of thoughts.
"Dr. Thompson? You... uhm... have a visitor," was all the unfamiliar woman said.
Hearing the nervousness in her voice left little doubt who that visitor was.

"You must've been working out!" Debbie exclaimed after their warm-up. "You don't even sweat one bit."
Michelle bit her lip. They had only done a slight warm-up, but Debbie had already noticed this particular aspect of her body. Her body would only produce sweat for one reason: pheromones. Fortunately, Debbie had been out of town for years, otherwise she would have wondered a lot more about the improvement in her appearance. This way, she assumed that Michelle had been hitting the gym for some time and in better shape because of that.
But this would only work for a time. The two women had no real intention of a workout, but they had to play along in order to blend in. For Michelle, blending in was an even bigger challenge, though. Not only wouldn't her body perspire regardless of the strain, Michelle also felt the urge to... do more. These few minutes on the treadmill had found her wanting to sprint with full force, to see how fast she could go.
Would she be able to run Olympic-level speed, even without any super energy in her body? This question had gone through her head the whole time, and all she would have to do was try it out. But with Debbie right next to her, this would be a mistake. After all, this was why they were here.
"Have you noticed anybody suspicious?" Michelle cut to the chase.
"Not really," came the answer. "But this is just the warm-up and cardio area. Not exactly the place where you show off enhanced strength."
"I didn't see anybody who looks enhanced either," Michelle commented, happy that Debbie hadn't noticed her endurance here.
"Hm, you think the Angel's appearance is part of her powers too?" Debbie asked.
"Uhm, maybe? It is a possibility after all." Michelle countered unsure whether she should stir Debbie into the right direction or not. After all she knew that the appearance was part of the package -- most of the time anyway. It would make it easier for her to fly under the radar if Debbie was looking for outrageously beautiful people, but at the same time it would be suspicious for her to know these details.
"Well, she was supposed to be outrageously beautiful, but she might've looked that way from the start." Apparently Debbie wasn't easily convinced. "I think it might be safer to keep our eyes open for any suspicious display of strength and not focus on appearance."
"If you say so," Michelle exclaimed. "I think we better split up for that."
"Yeah, this way we cover more ground," Debbie said, picking up her towel before walking away.
Michelle was glad that her colleague was seeing things this way. She didn't really expect them to run into another super here, at least not with the level of power Debbie was expecting. But at the same time, Michelle felt a certain curiosity about her current level of strength. Sure she wasn't capable of lifting several tons right now, but if the ease with which she had warmed up was any indication then she'd still be stronger than she looked.

Amanda looked around the lobby impatiently. It was bigger than she had anticipated, but the real problem was the people. She felt the stares of dozens of people on her and realized that she didn't really like being the center of attention. Then again, it was her own fault. She was super right now, and unlike at the bar yesterday, she had not gone for a normal outfit, but her self-made costume. The black costume with the red flames on it wasn't exactly encouraging others to think of her as a nice girl -- and the name Devil didn't help either. Truth was that she was just as nervous as the ones around her.
"He'll be here in a few minutes," the receptionist said weakly. Amanda could practically smell the fear.
"It's okay, I've got time." Amanda answered with a smile. This wasn't exactly true, however. She may have taken the day off, but the main reason was that Fred would be released from the hospital today. But this woman didn't know that.
"Uhm..." the woman began, "Is it true that you can, you know..." she blushed as she began fiddling around with her fingers.
"I can do what?" Amanda asked, trying to sound as friendly as possible in order to break the ice.
The woman was still fiddling, but eventually gathered the courage to ask. "C-can you really fly?"
"You mean like this?" Amanda asked as she rose a few inches off the ground.
"Oh my god," yelped not only the receptionist but a few of the other gawkers as well. Others made comments like, "She's the real deal," or "She can actually do it."
Fearing to be the next one to blush, Amanda touched down on the floor again.
"Seems like I arrived just in time," a female voice came from behind Amanda. She turned around and spotted Miu, the Asian girl she had encountered yesterday.
Miu was wearing a track-suit and a bag, looking like she wanted to go to the gym rather than a lab. But then again, they had been talking about the tests beforehand, which would include physical examination. And given that she wasn't super right now, Miu had to bring her change of clothes the old-fashioned way.
"Hi... uhm," Amanda hesitated to call her by name.
"Miu is just fine. I have no intention of going for a codename or something like that."
At this moment, Amanda could hear the faint ring of an elevator arriving, and as it opened, both James and a woman she hadn't seen before emerged from it.
"This is Dr. Archer," he introduced her. "She specializes in botany and will help us with our tests today."
"You can call me Deziree," she said.
As she shook the woman's hand, Amanda immediately felt that Deziree had been super too, and came to the conclusion that she was Desire, another woman she had encountered yesterday. The real surprise however was when she shook James' hand and learned that he was in the same boat. After last night she hadn't expected him to take the potion this quickly. Apparently Miu noticed both things too, but she kept quiet about it.
"Alright, let's go down to the lab, shall we?"

The young woman stared at Susan as if she was seeing a ghost. She was less surprised about the fact that Susan hovered in front of her like it was nothing than the fact that she had been brought here abruptly. Blue-Eyes had tracked her down and teleported her right into the mansion.
"Hi, I'm Susan," she introduced herself.
"J-Jennifer," the other woman stammered in response.
"Hello Jennifer, do you know why you're here?"
"No," she shook her head. "Do you remember the man who brought you here?"
A sheepish smile appeared on Jennifer's face. "Y-yes. I... met him before."
"Yeah, he's good at... meeting people," Susan leaned in close. "And afterwards something happened to you, didn't it? Something that made you... super."
With a gulp, Jennifer nodded. She was staring into Susan's eyes, transfixed by their golden glow that grew in intensity as Susan activated her mind control powers.
"Tell me, what could you do when you had these powers?"
Without any powers of her own, Jennifer had no resistance to Susan.
"I could defy gravity, I was really strong, and could see through walls."
Susan frowned at the shortness of the list. Apparently Jennifer hadn't found all the powers in the time she had. This included her individual power, if she even had one.
"Would you like to have these powers again?" Susan asked.
Jennifer nodded. "W-what do I have to do for that?"
"Not much, actually. All you have to do is fulfill my every wish."
Another nod. "I'll do that."
With a smile, Susan nodded for Blue-Eyes to do his thing. He grabbed her neck and infused her with super energy. Jennifer didn't resist but rather moaned as the super energy caused her body to change into a more suitable shape. In less than ten seconds, she turned from a pretty, yet otherwise average woman, into the same kind of goddess that Susan herself was. Her clothes protested in vain as she grew in size, stretching them to their limit in some places, and beyond these limits in others.
Once the transformation was over, Jennifer rose into the air, happy to feel the power again.
"Wow, I almost forgot how good it felt," she whispered.
"Yeah, we get that a lot," Susan commented before holding out her hand. "And now give me a bit of your super energy!"
Even without using her mind control powers, Jennifer did as she was told. She took Susan's hand and transferred a small amount of super energy to the other woman. Given Susan's vast reserves, the amount was laughable, but that was all she wanted. Susan smiled at Jennifer's obedience. Apparently the trick to controlling a super lay with the moment of application. Turning her into a slave first and empowering her after that greatly reduced the resistance she experienced.
"Uhm, do you have a change of clothes that I could borrow?" Jennifer's question broke her train of thoughts and reminded her that this kind of mind control didn't turn her into a soulless fool like Blue-Eyes.
"Unfortunately not. But you can create it yourself if you concentrate; just don't use it too much energy."
Jennifer did as she was told and quickly materialized a black leotard that reminded Susan of the one the Angel had worn. She felt the urge to punch the other woman through the next wall for the choice of clothes.
"I think black isn't really your color," she said instead.
Immediately, Jennifer changed the leotard’s color from black to the same pink as Susan's outfit.
"Much better. Now go outside; the others are waiting at the pool!" Just as Jennifer was about to hover out of the room, Susan added. "And take your clothes with you!"
"Of course," Jennifer waved her hand and suddenly the remains of her original outfit lifted off the ground and flew into her waiting hands.
"You didn't mention before that you could do that," Susan commented.
"I said I could defy gravity," Jennifer sounded surprised. "I thought it was clear that I didn't just mean my own body."
"Flight and telekinesis are two different powers, even though they both defy gravity," Susan commented before Jennifer left.
The moment she was alone, Susan concentrated on an expensive vase, causing it to lift into the air and then crash into the wall. "Thanks for the new power," she whispered before lifting the remains up with her mind and putting them into the next waste bin. Then she turned to Blue-Eyes again. "Now fetch me the next one!"

"Dr. Thompson, could you explain to me why the two of them are here?" Deziree asked aloud once the two women were in a separate room. Amanda and Miu were busy running on the treadmill. The first test was about their physical capabilities in unpowered and powered states.
"Because I invited them," came the answer. "And while we're at it, we should stop trying to hide our little secrets from each other." He held out his hand.
Deziree looked at him confused and anxious. Still, she took his hand -- and her eyes widened as she realized what he meant.
"When did you...?" she whispered. "How? Why?"
"Long after I left the bar. Which was a lot later than when you left. By the way, should I expect Jacob to be in the same state as us?"
Deziree blushed, yet shook her head. "But... your girlfriend... oh wait, it's Miu, right?"
Now it was James turn to blush. "No, it's not her. L-let's just say she's fine with it, alright?"
But Deziree didn't give up that easily. "If she's fine with it, she must be super too, right? That would mean it could also be the Angel!"
"Keep it down, will you?"
Now Deziree's eyes widened even further. "Oh my god, she really is! That's why she showed up yesterday, that strange bond worked like an SOS beacon!"
Rolling his eyes, James knew he couldn't talk himself out of it anymore. "Just keep quiet about it!" he hissed before making his way back to the others. "We've got some work to do after all."
Once arriving in the next room, it only took one look from Amanda for James to realize that their conversation hadn't been as private as he'd liked. With her improved hearing she had followed their conversation -- not that there was any news for her there. In fact, the only one still out of the loop was Miu.
Both women were still running at the same speed. According to the instruments, Amanda's pulse wasn't even raised despite her running at Olympic level. Miu, on the other hand, did show first signs of strain, but all in all her results were still impressive. After all, she had spent the last two years paralyzed, but right now she could probably pass for a professional runner.
"Seems like neither of them sweats," Deziree mentioned another interesting bit.
"H-how long do we have to keep running?" Miu panted. "I may not look like it, but I don't think I can keep this up much longer."
"Alright, then let’s end this," James suggested.
"Phew, didn't think I'd last that long," exclaimed the Asian woman when she stepped from the treadmill.
"For the first fifteen minutes you didn't seem to be affected at all," Amanda explained as she rose into the air. "After that, the lack of super energy in your system became apparent."
"Well, we could try again with the roles reversed," Miu joked.
"Maybe some day we will, but personally I'm glad that you can keep up with me like that."
"Hehe, thanks... so what’s the next test? Please tell me it's not going to be a direct competition."
"Well, actually I do have a competition in mind. Another race actually. But this time, the odds should be more even. Before we do that, however I would like to take the readings of what happens when you power up."
A smile appeared on Miu's face.

"And fifty," Michelle whispered as she finished her last repetition. Smiling, she looked around the gym again. She had now completed a full workout on all the machines with their highest weight settings without any special attention. Truth be told, she was surprised that she had managed to complete it. After a while, the strain of using the highest setting had become almost unbearable, but Michelle had pulled through -- and somehow her body had managed to deal with it. Michelle didn't feel any stronger now, however.
Actually she was quite exhausted, although she could probably continue for a bit. It was a weird feeling. Each time she was done, she felt exhausted, yet her body somehow dug into further reserves on the next machine. And having them on the highest setting meant that she was one of the strongest in the gym. In fact, Michelle was tempted to go over to the weights to see what she could achieve there. She didn't do it because her feats would be that much more obvious with the weights compared to the machines.
She had kept her eyes open in case anybody else pulled off something like this, but so far she was the only super in the gym -- and not even Debbie had noticed her little test run. Michelle wondered if she should start over with the first machine when Debbie returned from another part of the gym.
"Done with your workout?"
Michelle nodded. "Just finished."
"Me too. How about we go to the sauna and compare our results?"
"Hm, sure; that sounds nice."
They went back to the locker rooms and took off their clothes. During the whole time, Debbie didn't say a word about whether or not she found anything. In fact, Michelle felt her colleague’s gaze upon her, and became nervous. Had Debbie noticed that she was working out with far bigger weights that her looks implied?
Still, she didn't comment on that either, but rather played along. Five minutes later the two women were sitting in the small sauna alone.
"Alright," Debbie began. "I didn't find anything suspicious. How about you?"
"Nothing as well."
"Well, I guess this was a waste of time then," Debbie concluded as the first beads of sweat began to form on her forehead. "Except for a private workout, I mean."
Michelle chuckled. "You said it yourself, without a solid lead we can do little more than this."
"True, but it's still frustrating. Well, sometimes you just need luck to actually stumble over the big scoop."
Debbie laid down on the bench and Michelle did the same. The heat in the sauna felt good. Really good, actually. She could practically feel the exhaustion and strain from her workout leaving her body. Before she knew it, Michelle had closed her eyes.
The warmth seeped into her body, like a pleasant massage on a cellular level. It reminded Michelle of the feeling of super energy invading her body when she drank the potion, but this was a lot weaker. Whenever Michelle had taken the potion, the sheer speed had made it almost impossible to actually appreciate the signature feeling when her cells were flooded with the mysterious energy. Right now, the sauna heat provided her with just that feeling. It was so incredibly relaxing; Michelle could clearly feel her body recover.
She remembered the fire rescue. Back then her clothes had burned off her body, but she hadn't felt any discomfort but rather a pleasure. Slowly, Michelle realized the similarity. The sauna wasn't as hot as the fire, but apparently her body used it to regenerate the super energy it lacked. Just yesterday this was a very slow process that she only had noticed when she had dedicated her attention to it.
But now her body had become a lot quicker to do so, and with the sauna providing a lot of extra heat, the rate increased even further. Michelle however didn't really have a problem with that anymore. Ever since her boyfriend had joined her on this wonderful journey, Michelle was no longer scared of any of these changes. So far everything had developed to her advantage and as she fell asleep, she didn't bother with it in the least, but rather continued to enjoy the ride. And even when the warmth of the sauna was joined with the familiar feeling of weightlessness, she still didn't bother. Had she been awake, she would have, because she wasn't alone in the sauna.
