"Are you sure you want to do this?" Michelle asked once more.

James rolled his eyes. "You know that I gave it some thought, after all you read them."<!--more-->

"I know, it's just that I don't want you to hurry things just because of me!" she explained.

It wasn't even midnight yet, but they had been lying in bed for some time already. This had been mostly because Michelle had used her powers to let James view some of her memories, and even in her super form this required concentration and stillness. She had used up all of her power during that and, while she hadn't managed to show everything she wanted, she had given him an incredible view on herself. James could finally understand why she had been rushing things earlier when she had asked him to take the potion. If she had read him the way she had allowed him to read her, then it really was like they knew each other for years instead of just days.

"You made sure I’d catch up on the getting-to-know-you part," he simply exclaimed. "And that was pretty much my main issue there."

"What about the fact that you are working at a facility looking for people like me?" Michelle asked.

"Remember the colleague of mine that you saved from Ms. Harland today? She knew she'd be in the same boat, and that didn't stop her either. So I figured it might be better to give full disclosure, and take full advantage of the resources there. I mean, it's much more effective to research the effects of that plant if I don't have to secretly sneak in samples. Not to mention that Ms. Harland might get herself a deal to have herself examined. It would be better to have alternatives to her or at least someone who can keep her in check."

"You do have a point there," Michelle said with a smile. Apparently, this was enough to convince her. Actually, James was a bit more surprised that she needed convincing at all. After all, this was what she had been wanting all the time. "So... I do have an overnight bag with me..."

She didn't need to explain any further. He should have expected that Michelle had another dose of the potion with her when she arrived here. Apparently, she had one more for him as well. He gulped. There was no turning back then. Still, he nodded in approval.

Michelle pretty much jumped out of the bed, causing James to wonder where she even got the leverage from. The towel she had wrapped around her body fell to the floor, as she pretty much danced to the bag that, until now, had totally escaped James' attention. Even now a part of him was too occupied watching his girlfriend’s naked body to even care. For someone who was supposed to be exhausted after spending her last super energy to maintain their mental link, Michelle sure seemed very lively. Actually, she seemed more toned than he remembered her to be in her mortal form... or was that just his mind playing tricks on him? He did have a few drinks earlier after all.

"Here," she said as she held out two vials. One of them had a mark resembling a 'J' on it, obviously to make it clear that this one was for him.

"You really put some thought into that one," he commented.

"Of course, it would be disastrous if you drank the wrong one, wouldn't it?"

James couldn't argue with that. Not that he wanted to, anyway. Michelle signaled for him to get up.

"You should get rid of these clothes, too," she commented. "You might outgrow them after all."

Of course he complied, taking stock of her as he did so. She stood there on tip-toe to lessen their size difference. After all, he was a foot taller than her 5'3" while her super form looked eye-to-eye with him - when she wasn't airborne, that is.

"I hope I don't get too much taller," he said. "If I grow a foot like you, then I'd be sticking out way too much."

"Aww," Michelle kissed him. "Don't worry about that, you'll be great."

"Thanks."

Once he was done undressing she gave him the vial. "Alright, this is it."

"Y-you don't want to go first? I thought you would want to watch it happen in full detail."

"Well, that's true, but wouldn't you want the same?" Michelle countered. "If you're going to do that, I think it's only fair for me to take it when you have the super senses to take in every aspect of it, don't you think?"

James merely kissed her as an answer as he took the potion from her. It was decided then. He opened the vial and brought it to his mouth. With his eyes locked onto hers, he downed the contents.

"Ugh, doesn't taste too good," he commented as he felt his stomach growl. The alien liquid began its work right away, yet the effects he had witnessed on Michelle the day before had been much quicker.

Michelle framed his face with her hands, her expression a mixture of joy as well as unease. The latter must've been because of the growing pain he was beginning to feel. Within a few seconds, his head felt like it was going to explode, added with a fair deal of nausea that made him lose his balance.

Thankfully, Michelle was paying attention, and she caught him before he could even begin to fall, helping him settle down on the bed as the pain in his head grew further. Despite the visible distress, Michelle didn't show any sign of concern or fear, which James interpreted that this was within her expectations. He drew comfort from that, lying back on the bed, with her climbing on top of him.

"Just a bit longer," she whispered. "Then it'll be better."

It sure as hell couldn't get any worse, as the pain now clearly affected his vision and he was barely able to make out her face anymore. A second later his vision was completely gone, and her comforting touch was all that kept him from panicking.

A few moments later, the pain began to subside, and his vision returned. And as it did, he saw Michelle in a new light. The first thing he noticed was that any sign of unease was washed away from her face as she smiled at him brightly. Only then did he notice the level of detail he could detect on her. Even in the dim light, he could see every tiny detail on her face and see that she was flawless.

"Wow," he exclaimed.

"Right back at you," Michelle joked, "and now the good stuff is going to start!"

James noticed a blue hue on her face and immediately figured that it must be the reflection of his eyes. Apparently his eyes were the same color as hers when in super form.

"No more headache?"

"No more pain!" Michelle answered.

Now James was curious to see the stuff happening to him with his own eyes - only to remember that he didn't own a full length mirror to do so. Still, he rose from the bed. Now that the headache was gone, he wanted to at least give Michelle a good view of what was happening.

"Woah..." he exclaimed as he almost lost his balance again. He still felt a bit dizzy.

While holding his head, he noticed that his hair was beginning to fall out. For a moment he panicked before the lack of concern on Michelle's face reminded him that this was still going as planned. He tried to focus on her: the simple joy she expressed in watching the show of his hair falling out only to be replaced with totally new-grown hair. Nobody had ever mentioned that his head would itch like hell as this happened!

Fortunately, this ended after about twenty seconds. “Thank God for not having long hair,” he thought to himself before his whole body began to feel funny, as if his bones were being bent against their will - which was probably true. This continued, and the funny feeling became more and more uncomfortable as he began to notice his perspective getting higher. Michelle still didn't show any concern. In fact her smile grew as she sat there on the bed, her eyes darting over his lengthening body. That smile alone made things bearable for him.

Still, James was relieved when this phase ended, and the height growth subsided after what he estimated to be three or four inches at best - hopefully, less. He barely had time to consider whether or not his new height would be troublesome when the next stage started as he felt his muscles cramping up and flexing involuntarily.

"Ugh," he grunted through gritted teeth. Given what he knew from Michelle's experiences, James had expected things to be a lot more comfortable by now. Truth be told, the cramps weren't nearly as bad as the headache before; actually, they were less unpleasant than some normal cramps he had experienced. But while the feeling wasn't the same as it had been for Michelle, the outcome apparently was.

"It looks like someone's working out!" Michelle said seductively, nervously moving over the blankets.

"That's one way to put it," James answered. In fact, now that he thought about it, the muscle growth phase did feel a lot like one hell of a workout - one where he didn't actually do anything. Still, he couldn't deny that he liked the outcome. While he was quite athletically built from the get go, he had no problems with his body reaching bodybuilder qualities, especially not with Michelle barely capable holding herself back there. Now that he looked back at her, he noticed that she was sweating quite a bit. So far she had never perspired due to exhaustion since her transformation. The only reason for her to do so was...

He gulped. Was she really that horny?

After a few minutes his muscles stopped flexing, allowing him to move freely again. He looked down at himself and couldn't prevent a sheepish grin. Yep, he could easily enter any bodybuilding contest and win by a landslide.

A wave of energy suddenly washed over him, and with it any remnants of the cramps disappeared altogether. Since he was still watching himself, he noticed the strange glow that appeared from right underneath his skin wherever the energy had been. Now he was able to see the super energy as well.

"Wow, this is really a new perspective," he commented as he looked back to Michelle. With a smile, he began walking over to her. Even though the transformation itself wasn't arousing at all - as opposed to Michelle's - her mere presence more than made up for it, even though she was in her mortal form.

James blinked. Just now he realized that it bothered him that she was still in her mortal form. He didn't really know why, though. Sure her other self was more attractive, but that wasn't it. The only other difference would be her powers - or lack thereof right now. Yeah, that was it. Even though her mortal form was still capable of winning several gold medals right now - he felt strangely sure about that - this was nothing compared to what her other self was capable of. No, if anything, James wanted her to turn back into the goddess she had been before.

With this in mind, he leaned down to kiss her. Even before their lips met, he noticed how he instinctively tried to share some of his super energy with her through skin contact; more surprising than this, however, was that he failed to do so because Michelle was refusing it from her end.

"Why aren't you accepting the energy?" he asked.

"Where is the fun in that?" Michelle teased. "I want you to *make* me accept it!"

Now that was an interesting turn of events! Michelle, who had wanted him to take the potion, was now turning the tables. James already had some ideas about how he could break her concentration...

"Whoa..." James suddenly exclaimed as he felt what he first thought to be losing his balance, but quickly noticed it was something else entirely.

"Finally, you're getting airborne," Michelle exclaimed. "I almost doubted that you could fly at all since you didn't lift off right away."

"Maybe I didn't think happy thoughts," James countered as he lowered himself again, quickly finding that flying was far easier than he had anticipated. Leaning down to her again, he whispered, "Maybe you'd like to join me up here?"

"A tempting offer," Michelle held up her hands. "I hope you're strong enough to carry me!"

"Strength is definitely not the issue," James thought to himself only to realize that this wasn't exactly true. Up until now, Michelle had used her power sharing to prevent him from harm when she was in her super form. That only worked because he was a normal human being and couldn't affect the super energy; Michelle, however, denied him this, meaning that there was risk of hurting her if he used too much strength.

A smirk appeared on her face. She had planned this!

Still, James played along. Carefully he lifted her off the bed and turned around in midair, resulting in her lying on top of him in a close embrace. With their skin contact maximized, James couldn't help but try to share the super energy with her, but Michelle kept refusing.

"Hmm, cuddling already?" she mocked as she straightened herself up, sitting on top of him now. "I thought we'd be more active before that." She ran her hands over his chest, actually trying - and failing - to dent his pectorals. "Hmm, not just for show, it seems."

James had to admire her willpower. Despite her undeniable arousal, she managed to keep herself under control. He was positive that a big part of her wanted to stop this futile resistance, turn into the goddess she was supposed to be and then start the lovemaking of a lifetime. But this game had already started, and she wanted him to make the first move.

He complied. As Michelle leaned down to tease him again, he grabbed her head - carefully - and kissed her passionately. At the same time, he forced himself to stop trying to push the energy into her. Continuing their kiss, his hands traveled down her body. He reached her breasts and slowly fondled them, steadily increasing her anticipation, before suddenly trying to blast as much super energy into them as he could.

"Aaahhh!" Michelle threw her head back, her brown hair instantly growing and turning blonde, doing so while she changed into her super form.

James watched in awe as her breasts readily absorbed the energy he offered which caused them to be the very first part of her to take on super proportions. For the fragment of a second, her DD-cup breasts looked outright ridiculously large on her small frame before the energy spread throughout her body and caused it to catch up on that front. Only a few seconds were needed for the transformation to be complete; her moaning, however, lasted longer.

"Now that's what I call foreplay!" Michelle exclaimed as she had regained control. "How is it? Do you like what you see?"

What a stupid question.

"The most beautiful woman in the world," he answered, dragging her in for a kiss.

"Hm, good answer, and now to the main course." Her hands traveled down his body, and when she reached his member, her eyes widened. "Feels like your little friend isn't so little
anymore..."

Thanks to her touch, he was standing at attention as well.

"What are you going to do about that?" he asked teasingly.

"Just wait and see... but first we need to get out of here."

"What?"

"We don't want to tear the building down, do we?"

James gave her an understanding nod, and Michelle made her way to the window before noticing the second vial of super potion still lying on the floor.

"You may want to drink that," she exclaimed. "I don't want you to run out of steam right when it's good after all!"

She then opened the window and quickly flew through it. Nobody outside had a chance in noticing her flight.

As she rose up to the night sky, he remembered an important detail about that second dose: It had been from Michelle's plant as opposed to the one from the lab. Wouldn't that mean he would mutate again and become related to her in the process? James shook his head. Despite his fear, he just knew that this - or any other - potion would only increase his energy supply while the mutation was only caused by the very first dose, and he had already taken that. Not allowing himself another doubt, he downed the contents of the second vial and followed Michelle into the night sky.

It didn't take long for him to catch up to her, and he was relieved to notice that she still attracted him just as much as before. In fact nothing could compare to this image of angelic beauty that glowed in the night sky - even though said glowing was caused by his ability to see the super energy inside her. The fact that he was defying gravity on his own to reach her suddenly seemed trivial at best.

"Alright, where were we?" he asked as he hugged her. "Oh yeah, right the main course!"

"Right here where everybody could see us? How about we find some place more private?" she suggested.

James had his doubts that normal people would be able to spot them up here. Other supers on the other hand would have no problem doing so. And he could see it in Michelle's eyes that she had already made a plan for that as well.

"I take it you don't want to add a few more craters to the nearby mountainside?"

Michelle shook her head as she grinned. "When I flew around the world yesterday, I spotted this cute little island in the Pacific Ocean. It's so romantic and uninhabited to boot."

"Sounds like it'll take a while to get there."

"If we fly full speed, it should only be a few minutes. Come, this way."

 

 

Miu looked around the club and frowned. Even though it was the middle of the week, the room was full. Well, she wasn't really one to talk as she roamed the city on her own like that every night. While Monday she had been out with friends, both yesterday and today had been all about her. Most of these friends hadn't heard the good news about her miraculous recovery yet. So far, the only people she had told about the powers she had possessed once were the two she had met in the bar earlier who obviously had more knowledge on the matter than herself.

This had both its good and bad sides. The good side was that they had been giving her a lot of information about herself and the big picture regarding the hybrids of which she was now one, especially considering that she seemed to possess a talent that other supers didn't have: the ability to track down anybody she had met before. As for the bad side, there was the issue of her giving them full disclosure on her actions while having the powers, which included her exacting her revenge on the man responsible for binding her to a wheelchair for years.

That was a thing of the past, though. Even with the incredible powers gone, her legs still worked the way they had before. When Miu watched the crowded dance floor, she didn't feel miserable like she would have a few days ago; in fact, she considered joining these people and showing them what she could do.

She had done that yesterday and was still happy with the outcome. One would think that, after not being able to walk for years, her legs’ muscularity would have atrophied to the point where dancing would be out of question for a time. Not for her. Miu had rocked the dance floor for hours without a break before even feeling tired. She also had gotten attention from a few guys, actually, but nothing had come from that.

Now that she thought about it, she wondered how her other self would have fared. With these supernatural looks, she would've had a guy at each finger - and probably each toe as well. Miu subconsciously rubbed her thighs together. The more she thought about it, the more she liked the idea of becoming this superpowered goddess again, which is why she was here in the first place.

Unfortunately, Miu wasn't very tall, and finding the person she looked for wasn't as easy. In fact, she wasn't even sure whether she was at the right place right now. After all this was her first test run of using her tracking ability since she had turned back to normal. She shook her head. No, this wasn't the time to doubt herself. Closing her eyes, she tried to access her tracking ability. There he was!

Without a second thought, she turned around to make her way through the crowd into a corner where a certain someone was eyeing the situation. As his blue eyes met hers, he actually seemed to need a moment to recognize her.

"Oh, it's you," he exclaimed. "Uhm… Miu was it?"

She nodded, not caring to bother that he even struggled to remember her name. She didn't even know his. "We need to talk."

He seemed utterly surprised but eventually shrugged before answering, "Sure, why not?"

They searched for a free booth even though it was crowded, and Miu was surprised that there actually was one that allowed them to talk in private.

"Alright, what do you want?" he asked once they sat down, "and more importantly how did you find me?"

Miu smirked upon hearing that. This confirmed that her tracking ability was indeed special.

"Actually, I wanted to talk about the effect you had on me," she began. "You could say I turned into a totally different person for a bit, and when I turned back... well you can see for yourself."

"Yeah, I tend to have that effect on women," he said with pride, "and for some reason it's also a one-time thing."

"I know what you mean," Miu answered. "Actually, I was looking for you to talk about that aspect. Do you know why we have no interest in hooking up anymore?"

He shook his head.

"Well it's actually quite simple. You mutated me into some kind of half-alien-plant hybrid, and the alien part of my DNA happens to be an exact copy of the alien part of your DNA, effectively making us related now."

"Alien? Sorry to break your illusion, but I'm not from outer space," he answered. "I may be out of this world, but not in the literal sense!"

Yep, he sure had no self-esteem problems.

"That's not what I meant! I've been talking to a scientist who has figured out that anybody who had these powers once was actually a half-alien hybrid. The alien part seems to come from a plant, which you probably know better than me."

"I'm not really following you here, but I get that when I gave you these powers, I turned you into a relative."

"Pretty much. I figured you would want to know that. Especially since you helped me out a lot here." She clapped on to her legs to empathize.

"I guess that makes sense, and I guess the solution to that happening would be for the woman to gain her powers from some other plant instead of me?"

Miu nodded.

"Well, I figured as much. So, all I have to do is either find someone like this or another plant." He took a sip from his drink. "Is there anything else you wanted to tell me?"

"Hm, now that you bring it up, I'd… like to have this power again." Miu felt herself blush as she said that. Truth be told, she had trouble admitting it to herself; asking someone else was even worse.

"Ha! I can imagine that," he leaned over. "But I'm not charity. What am I getting out of the deal?"

Miu pondered her options. Sex was clearly out of question. Even though her benefactor was absolutely hot in appearance, the aforementioned incest problem made her lose any interest in that. There was no further information she could give him, either, except for one thing.

"You asked me how I found you, right? Well, there's a little trick to that. Apparently, I have some kind of special ability that allows me to track people. If I were super, I could show you how to do it!" She added a quick explanation about how such special abilities could be passed down by sharing the person's super energy with one another. Even though she wasn't a real expert on that, the idea of regaining the power grew on her. Earlier she may have had no interest in that, given that her actions with these powers had been harsh if not evil. Ever since she had met Devil and learned that these powers would return on their own, she had begun to reconsider the situation. By now she had stopped wondering how she would have reacted if Devil had offered these powers to her and wondered why she hadn't asked her for them instead.

"The ability to track people? So you could tell me where the Angel is right now?"

"Well... uhm," Miu hesitated. She hadn't even considered the possible usage of this ability. "M-maybe... I mean... I only used it twice so far on people I have met before, and it was a lot easier when I was super."

He leaned back and apparently considered his options. "If you say you want that power back, how much exactly are you talking about?"

"As much you'd like to give me," Miu answered sheepishly. She had barely prevented herself from blurting out "As much as possible!" instead.

He raised his brow but then burst into laughter. "Well, given that women don't seem to regenerate the stuff at all, it only seems plausible that you want as much as possible."

Miu nodded, happy that he understood. What's more was that he seemed to think that regenerating super energy would be a male trait. According to Devil, this was not the case; it was rather a matter of time for her to be able to recharge on sunlight alone. Still, Miu decided not to mention that. After all, this way he would give her more.

"H-how long does it take for you to regenerate?" she asked eventually. After all, this was something unknown to anyone.

He leaned back in thought, then scratched his head as he answered. "Actually, I have no idea. It's a bit strange, actually. I didn't use these powers too much in the last weeks. In fact, the most power consuming thing I did so far would be sex: making my partner invulnerable so I can use more strength than I need to, and ultimately my seed takes quite a lot of power with it, but strangely I feel perfectly rested only a few moments later - being fully recovered so to speak."

Miu raised her brow. "A few moments? That sounds awfully quick."

He shrugged. "That's how it feels. It wasn't always like that. Especially in the beginning, it took me a while to feel... full. Maybe I'm not really full, but storing that extra energy somewhere else to become available after I exert myself?"

"Maybe you should have that checked out?"

"I’ll leave the research to you," he said with a smile. "Then again, maybe I’ll power you up as much as possible and wait to see when I'm back at full power?"

Miu blushed, and her eyes grew wide. Had she just heard right? He was intending to give her all of his power? That sounded fishy. She may not be the person to take advantage of this, but he was putting a lot more trust in her than was good for him. For God's sake she didn't even know his name! "A-all of your power? I-isn't that a bit much?" she found herself stammering.

"I told you I recover quickly," he exclaimed. "If you don't believe me, it would be best for me to show you. After all, the night is still young, and I'm sure you'd like to get your boost sooner rather than later. Truth be told, that tracking ability of yours sounds really interesting."

He rose from the seat and looked around. "Alright, lets find a quiet place then."

 

 

"Gotcha!" James exclaimed as he brought his arms around Michelle to hug her closely. Under other circumstances this might have counted as the romantic gesture it was, but, given the speed with which they were moving across the ocean, his exclamation would never reach Michelle's ears even though they were so close. After all, they were traveling at almost Mach 35: a speed where the sound of his voice couldn't keep up.

So far the trip had been a strange mixture of teasing and learning for him. Michelle had turned a trip of several thousand miles into a game of tag by having James chase her, steadily picking up speed to force him to eventually reach the maximum speed he was capable of.

That speed was around Mach 35. The number didn't surprise him that much, actually. After all, before her stunt with the plane, Michelle had traveled around the world in about an hour with her own max speed as well. He had done the math and figured that her top speed had been around the same back then, so it was only fair for him to reach similar levels now. The truly interesting part, however, was that he had a very… intuitive feel about the numbers at play here. Even though he had no equipment to measure their speed, he just knew how fast they were among other things.

"Nicely done!" Michelle answered; her lips were not moving, but her thoughts arrived right in his mind. "Now let's pick up the pace, shall we?"

James held fast to her, already expecting that her top speed had improved significantly after the plane incident. Yet he had trouble counting the number of sonic booms that followed as her speed tripled. Holding on to her was a good idea after all, given that she would be out of sight the moment he let go.

Fortunately for him, they arrived at their destination about ten seconds later. Somewhere in the darkness of the sea, there was a tiny uninhabited island. Michelle slowed down, and they descended still in each other's arms.

"What do you think about it?" Michelle asked, her words being able to reach his ears again.

"It's perfect. A tiny place of paradise with nobody around but us."

Michelle smiled and James couldn't resist the urge to kiss her. Her scent filled his nostrils and quickly reawakened the primal urges that had taken the back seat during their trip here. The logical explanation for this was that, during their supersonic flight, breathing had been optional to begin with. Neither of them paid any mind to logical explanations now. Their kissing became more passionate as they were still hovering high above the island. His hands traveled across her body, squeezing and fondling where they could. He had done so before, but this time everything felt different. It wasn't just his heightened senses that made a difference. Michelle herself was a lot more… passionate... right now.

He felt her grabbing his member to slowly stroke it before spreading her legs as a definite sign for him to enter her. James gladly complied and smiled as she moaned in return. When Michelle looked back at him, the light coming from her eyes seemed even brighter than before - and filled with more passion than he thought possible. She then leaned in for a close embrace and brought them into a horizontal position with him on top of her.

"Alright, time to come to paradise," she whispered in his ear before dragging him downwards.

For a split-second James though she simply stopped keeping herself afloat but then he noticed that she was indeed flying towards the ground instead. Once he gave up his resistance, the ground came closer quickly. Before he could figure out her intentions, they crashed into the sandy beach.

*Boom!*

Sand flew in every direction as their bodies landed with more force than most bombs could achieve. Not even a second later another *Boom!* followed, along with more sand that came out of the growing crater the two of them had created there. James body had figured out her intentions before his mind could keep up: Michelle intended to use the ground as leverage for him to drill her. And that he did, as every subsequent thrust caused another Boom! accompanied with moans from Michelle that grew louder and louder.

"Aaahhhhhh," Michelle suddenly screamed in pleasure as she reached her climax. Instead of letting James drill her further into the ground, she now actively resisted, pushing them slowly, but surely out of the crater.

James noticed that the super energy inside her seemed to go wild, running through her body with incredible speed - and an equally incredible side-effect, her body began to glow slightly. Glow in a way that it didn't require super senses to see it. James remembered the previous night when this had happened. Back then, it had taken longer for her to do so, however.

"D-don’t...  stop!" he heard her voice in his mind.

Apparently he had hesitated a bit when he noticed her glowing, but he didn't need to be asked twice and quickly picked up the pace. Michelle threw her head back in the process, her hands gripping his back with all her might - and he even felt pain as her fingernails dug into his flesh. That didn't slow him down however, if anything it caused him to try even harder. Their bodies moved in perfect synch with each other now, her body anchoring itself for each thrust, while her inner walls massaged his member in a way only she could do.

Opening her eyes Michelle grinned as she blasted a short burst of heat vision onto his chest. James was startled for a split-second, but immediately realized that her heat vision didn't penetrate his skin at all. The only thing he could feel was a slight warmth where he was hit, as the excess energy was absorbed into his body. It wasn't much, but he knew it was there.

He began to grin as he recalled her story about how the heat vision was discovered in the first place, and her smile told him that she was looking forward to a second coming of that. Actually, she probably blasted him for the sole purpose of enabling him to return the favor. Focusing the super energy in his eyes, he shot two beams of light right onto her erect nipples.

"Aaahhhhhh!" Michelle's answer was yet another scream, as her body rocked with the incredible force of her orgasm. The light emanating from her became brighter, surpassing the level she had the night before. James noticed that her body began to feel different, the very touch of her skin now seemed inherently pleasurable.

This change applied to every place their bodies touched, from her hands on his back, her back under his– and, most importantly, her inner walls that still massaged his member. James still continued to blast his heat vision into her breasts, his body moving on autopilot here. The sudden spike in pleasure she inspired in him took its toll and a mere five seconds after it started, he could take no more.

Without a warning he shot his load into her, and immediately felt her being rocked by yet another orgasm. Once again the light coming from her grew brighter, and she drew him in for a kiss. He barely noticed the sizeable amount of super energy he had blasted into her, as though his rational mind had taken the back seat and all he could do was to enjoy the moment with Michelle. And so they remained in a close embrace, hovering over the beach of a small island, lost in the afterglow of their lovemaking.

 

 

"Aright, let's do this," was all he said.

Miu and her yet unknown benefactor had found a small sidestreet a block from the club where they were alone.

Her heart almost skipped a beat as she realized that this was it. In a moment she would be the unstoppable goddess that she had been a few days ago. Even though she had been there before, she couldn't help but look forward to it.

"Take my hand!" he said, and Miu quickly complied.

"I still don't know your name," she sheepishly exclaimed, just to distract herself a bit.

"This is good," he commented.

His hands felt… normal. No, not normal, but rather the same way Devil's had felt when Miu had shaken her hand earlier that evening. She knew that she could feel the difference between a human and a hybrid like herself, so it didn't surprise her as much. What did surprise her was that she could already feel the energy flowing into her body through their hands. Miu felt that she could indeed force it to stop, but why would she do that?

As the energy began to fill her, she felt her body responding in kind. Miu closed her eyes as the energy traveled to her head, her mind seemingly awakening and opening up to the new sensations she would be able to pick up soon. Her perception was so good already that she could already feel the growth of her own hair happening at the same time.

Miu smiled as she reveled in the feeling. It just felt so good to feel this energy again, and it happened a lot faster than the first time around.

"Time to pick up the pace," she heard her benefactor say.

He wasn't kidding. The flow of energy from him suddenly doubled - no, tripled! - in velocity. Miu moaned as the energy made its way to every part of her body with the transformation now happening even faster. Still closing her eyes, Miu felt her clothes constrict around her frame, then groan in protest, before her growing body began to rip them apart. A part of her wanted to at least save her shoes from that fate, but, when she tried to put them off in this position, all she did was rip them apart with more force.

The power continued to fill her, and Miu could already picture the trim titaness that she had become by now as the last stage of her transformation began. She began to moan - totally ignoring the man standing right in front of her who made the entire thing possible - as the power entered her breasts, causing them to grow in size just like the rest of her body had done. Miu felt herself getting lighter and lifted off the floor altogether. Only a few seconds later, her transformation was over, yet the flow of power didn't cease. Her freshly expanded breasts seemed all too eager to store the power. Miu smiled all the more as she realized just how much capacity they provided - so much more than the rest of her body - and filling that capacity felt great.

Opening her eyes again, Miu was shocked for a split-second as she hadn't expected to see her benefactor the way she did now. She could clearly see what she had thus far only felt: the power going from him to her. The strange part was that, on the outside, he didn't seem to have as much capacity as her. Well, actually, that wasn't much of a surprise given that he lacked the breasts that made up the majority of her capacity. How was he able to fill her up that much then? It didn't look like his supply lessened in any way!

Curiosity got the better of her, and Miu activated her X-ray vision. Even though she had used it during her first time as a super, she wasn't fully prepared for what she saw. There were the insides of the human - or, in this case, superhuman - body that she had expected. Besides that, there was something else inside him. Thick, greenish veins ran parallel to his blood vessels branching throughout his whole body, held together by some kind of core right next to his stomach. From there on, some kind of roots seemed to have settled around the stomach itself as well as the rest of his digestive system.

Thinking back at her conversation with Devil and that scientist, Miu came to the conclusion that this must be a plant similar to the ones they had talked about, except that this one had grown inside the man’s body instead of a flower pot. This also explained the seemingly endless amount of reserves he had. Whenever his own supply was used up, the plant inside him would immediately recharge him, effectively increasing his capacity by that of the plants.

Once Miu had come to this conclusion, she stopped the energy transfer on her part. This was partially because she didn't want to cut too big a hole in his not-so-infinite supply and partially because she knew that, if she reached her full capacity, she would never be able to turn back; that was a step she wasn't willing to take just yet. Now that she thought about it, this meant that her benefactor was stuck like this, too, even without the plant inside him keeping him super-charged.

"It seems like you can't take anymore!" he exclaimed as he let go of one hand, still holding the other.

Miu nodded and finally allowed herself to concentrate on herself again. The amount of power that had found its way into her body was several times more than it had been the first time. She wondered how long it would last? At least for the next 24 hours, she thought, but that probably depended on what she would do with her time.

"Alright, now it's your turn," he suddenly said.

"Hmm... what? Oh, yeah... right... the tracking ability."

Miu quickly tried to access this ability - figuring she should try tracking down Devil's current position - and immediately felt the distance and direction in which she was situated. From the looks of it, she would assume that she was at the hospital right now. Confident she knew that it worked, she directed some of this energy back through their hands and into his body.

"Okay, that should do the trick. If you try to locate someone you know, you should be able to sense where they are."

He closed his eyes, then suddenly turned sideways and opened them again.

"Yeah, I think I got it!" he exclaimed as he turned back to Miu. "Well, that settles our deal... bye!"

Miu was tempted to ask him about his plans now but figured that he wouldn't tell her anyway. After all, she still didn't know his name, and he made it clear that he didn't want her to know it. The bottom line was that she was already concentrating on planning her next course of action as the night was only so long after all.

Looking down, she appreciated her body for once. Her physique was indeed something else, combining the fit and athletic build she had always strived for with larger-than-life curves, thus creating an image that emitted power while at the same time being incredible feminine. She smiled as she realized that only very few women on this planet could match these kinds of looks.

Unfortunately, this couldn't be said about her outfit.  The transformation had mostly destroyed her clothes, and the rags that still clung to her body had no chance of keeping her decency. Any man who saw her like this would probably be reduced to one thought. The way she felt right now, Miu would be inclined to let them carry out that thought.

She felt herself rise higher in the air. Looking down, she giggled as she wiggled her toes that were now about three feet above the ground.

"Now that could become a handicap on the dance floor," she joked before returning to the more pressing issue and created an outfit for herself.

Her choice fell on a green leotard paired with black leggings that went just below her knee - an outfit quite similar to the one she had worn when dancing in the studio. In terms of footwear, she couldn't create more than ballerina-lookalikes anyway. All in all, Miu was pretty sure she had figured out why the Angel had chosen a similar skintight and minimalistic outfit: she simply couldn't create a more elaborate one - at least unless she had the advanced cloth-creating abilities Devil had mentioned earlier. Those would have come in handy just now, but Miu would have to play with the hand she'd been dealt.

Picking up her shredded outfit, she tried to use the rags as some kind of highlight and actually managed to turn her shredded blouse into a sarong that stuck to her outfit. Giving herself a final once-over, she touched down on the ground and strutted back towards the club.

From the very moment she was out in the open again, the differences between the improved her and the goddess she was now became apparent. The people outside the club already turned their heads towards her - men and women alike. Miu tried to play it as cool as possible, but the joy of being the center of attention was just too much, and she rewarded the audience with a genuine smile.

Inside, things weren't too different. The people who could notice her clearly had trouble taking their eyes off her. Miu giggled as she saw a girl quickly kissing the guy next to her in what seemed a desperate attempt to regain his attention. The guy was clearly surprised at first but didn't look too unhappy about that.

As Miu continued her stride towards the dance floor, the people around her readily made way for her. As she stepped onto it, the same could be said for the dance floor itself. When a new song started to play, it became clear to her: Her stage had been set.

The Asian woman didn't need another invitation. Yesterday she may have already rocked the dance floor, finding that she was already better than she had been before her forced two-yea  hiatus. Now, her body was brimming with power, and Miu couldn't wait to give it a test run. Naturally, she began moving to the music, her improved mind already working on a choreography that would fit the music and test out the limitations of her new body - or rather the lack thereof.

Putting the plans into motion was just unbelievably easy. The control she had over her body was just that great, making it ridiculously easy to perform the moves she had struggled with before her unwanted break. As she performed the dance of her life, Miu noticed that her audience grew steadily, with the people standing around the dance floor andcheering her on as her moves became more and more challenging. Before long, she could hear the song coming to its climax, and she couldn't help but use the opportunity to give a big finale herself. Positioning herself at one end of the dance floor, she started with a series of backflips that carried her to the other side of the floor.

It was just too easy for her. Even two years ago she had been able to do that, but now it was just ridiculous. One, two, three … the backflips were nothing for her, and she mentally patted herself on the back for having calculated the amount of backflips she could do before reaching the end of the dance floor.

That's when she realized her mistake. Her calculations had been based on body size - her original body size. With her super form being taller, she had planned at least one too many backflips, and she was already in the process of performing it! Miu's mind raced, hoping that the woman standing in her path had figured that out as well. Now refocusing, she noted that unfortunately the woman was just about to realize the mistake, too. A mere human wouldn't be able to dodge in time, especially not with so many people behind her. Only Miu herself could prevent a crash, and she was almost back in the handstand that marked the halfway mark of the backflip when it hit her.

Just as she was in the handstand, she used her flight powers to anchor herself, immediately stopping the flow of her motion. Then she pressed with her hands against the ground and did one more midair flip before landing in the middle of the dance floor again. With the song now over, there was a second of silence before the people around her suddenly burst into applause. Miu's eyes quickly found the woman was relieved that she was alright; she was also applauding Miu for what everybody here assumed to be her planned grand finale.

A new song began to play, and the applauding people now began occupying the dance floor themselves. Miu continued to dance but a lot tamer than before due to the much smaller space she had. Of course, her little show had left her the center of attention, and she wondered what to do next. After all, the night was still young, and she now had her pick from a number of admirers.

 

 

The small island looked more like a war-torn battlefield than the tiny paradise it had been mere hours before; Michelle, however, wasn't that bothered about it. After all, the destruction had been caused by their lovemaking, and she had thoroughly enjoyed it. Now they were hovering in each other's arms above the beach waiting for the first rays of the sun to arrive. It would still be many hours until the next sunrise on the mainland.

"What are you thinking about?" James asked. "You seem worried."

"I'm just trying to figure out what happened earlier," she said. 

"You mean when you turned into a human light bulb?"

Michelle nodded. "It seems that the super energy is running wild during my orgasm which causes this reaction. But that doesn't really explain its other effect, does it?"

"Well," James shrugged. "We're more or less at war with the laws of physics, so the Law of Conservation of Energy is just one more victim here. That makes it hard to explain why we have more super energy than before."

"I probably shared something with you while we were at it," Michelle tried to remember the details, but she had been kinda distracted back then, "or maybe you absorbed the light coming from me to generate super energy?"

"Hmm, you mentioned that you absorb sunlight or heat, which makes it likely for us to absorb any kind electromagnetic wave, but that doesn't make sense either."

"Why not? So far it made most sense to me."

"It may seem like that, but the numbers don't add up. The energy carried by sunlight or even fire is far too low to allow feats like we can do. Carrying an airplane may be theoretically feasible with the energy provided by sunlight, but it’s not when you consider the size of the plant that was supposed to absorb it in a short timeframe."

"Maybe it can absorb more than its size suggests?"

"No, that isn't possible either. Even if it did, the result would be a darkness coming from the plant; since heat seems to be absorbed as well, it would also be cold. Even we - who have a similar ability - are warm to the touch, so we definitely don't absorb every electromagnetic wave that we encounter."

"So, we don't really recharge by absorbing anything?" Michelle asked.

"I think the sunlight or the heat serve as catalysts that allow the plant - or our bodies - to generate the super energy, and your ‘glow-gasm’ may have been a catalyst as well."

Michelle chuckled at the word and then focused on the first rays of the sun that appeared on the horizon. Given that they had been talking about it, she subconsciously paid attention to how her body reacted to the light, finding that it dulled her energy consumption - or rather caused her to regenerate slightly while her body still used up the energy it needed to retain its super form. Remembering how she had done the same several hours ago, she noticed that the light seemed to have a much bigger effect on her already.

"Well, even if we're not actually absorbing sunlight and heat, the fact remains that it restores our super energy, right? If sex has the same effect, I'm all for it; after all, that one clearly involves us both." With a sensual smile, she added "Maybe we should give it another test run?" before kissing him again.

 

 

Susan Harland couldn't sleep. She was lying curled up in the poor excuse for a bed that was her only furnishing of her prison cell - except the toilet, of course. By now she was wondering if solitary confinement was really better than having to share the cell with someone else. At least that way she would’ve had some conversation.

Instead, she was alone. Once the cops were done with her questioning, she was placed here. Tomorrow things would continue, and the bail would be decided. She was confident that her father would be able to amass the money; he was rich after all. The real problem would be the conditions he'd probably bind to that. Today’s events had left Susan as some kind of freak: looking super, but now without the powers. She may not be the world-class geneticist that her father was, but she knew enough about the issue to know that she would probably exchange one prison cell for another. The new one would be full of many kinds of sensors that would try to pick up how her body worked now.

Why hadn't she listened to her father’s advice and left the lab quickly? Nobody had been aware of her ascension, and, if she had played her cards right, that would still be the case. Instead, she had stuck around and vented her anger on the first person she came across: Deziree Archer. That woman had been in charge of "taking care" of Susan when she was at the lab - mostly so that she wouldn't disturb her father's work, of course.

She sighed. When she thought about the whole situation calmly, attacking Deziree must've been the single, most stupid thing she had ever done. Sure, she didn't like the other woman, and that had been mutual from the beginning. What had started as Susan messing with the other woman had turned into what the police had called "attempted murder" which was far beyond what she had originally intended. It was by far the most problematic accusation that she faced. The only thing she had going for her was that she hadn't been thinking straight. All things considered, that had been the truth.

In hindsight, her frustration of being sent to Deziree's lab - where the latter had been tinkering with plants, instead of any other lab where the sudden appearance of superpowered women had been discussed - had been misaimed in an ironic way. After all, that was the lab where she had found that strange liquid that had powered her up during her fight with the Angel. In other words, the superpowers were in some way related to a plant in the lab, which was why Susan had been all too eager to inform the police that she'd been fucked into goddesshood with no mention of any plant whatsoever.

"Hello, sleepy head," came a familiar voice from the barred window.

Susan turned around to find the very same guy who had turned her super in the first place. The first thing she noticed was that, despite the latter’s undeniable good looks, she didn't feel any attraction to him the way she had this afternoon.

"What do you want?" she whispered back as she rose from her bed.

"Straight to the point, huh? Well, that makes it easier. I learned about a new aspect of our kind, and I want to test it out on you."

He wanted to use her again. Susan hated that, but at least this guy had been honest about it. She couldn't really complain on their first encounter either.

"What would this be about?"

"Well, apparently, people like us have individual powers that others don't have. At the same time, they can easily share that power with others by giving them a tiny bit of their energy. So, here's the deal: I give you some of my energy, you return a tiny bit of it so I can get your individual power and you can keep the rest like last time. What do you say?"

Just like that, she had been presented an alternative to being a guinea pig. Not to mention the crucial new piece of information.

"If I understand that correctly, I'd get your individual power as well, right?"

He seemed to shrug, but it was hard to tell in the middle of the night through a small, barred window. "I don't really know what that would be, actually. Truth be told, you would already have received that one from me during our last encounter, but I already know that it works because I tried it with another woman's tracking power."

"Tracking power?"

He sighed. "She - or rather we - can sense the location of any person we have met before. That's how I found you here. You can test it out for yourself if you agree to the deal."

Susan thought about it, trying to figure out her own personal power. Remembering her fight with the Angel, the latter probably had some kind of super reaction that gave her a speed advantage during the fight. But what about Susan herself? Suddenly, the images of Deziree kissing her feet and that cop throwing away his gun and later explaining the plant liquid to her came to mind. All these events had happened right after she ordered them to do just that.

A smirk appeared on Susan's face. Her individual power was mind control! Part of her wanted to kick herself for not noticing that while she was able to use it, as it would have come in handy in her fight with the Angel. Then again, she could still play her cards right.

"Alright, I'm in," Susan declared, holding out her hand towards the window. "Power me up!"

With a chuckle, he grabbed her hand and did as he was told. Susan could feel the familiar power entering her body again, and she quickly became weightless to stare him eye to eye through the barred window. All too quickly, however, she felt the flow of energy end.

"That should be enough for you to get out of here," he exclaimed. "Now it's your turn; a tiny bit will be enough already."

"Alright, alright," Susan said. "But first I'd like to test something myself." She made sure he waslooking right into her eyes when their golden glow intensified. "*Give me as much power as possible!*"

Immediately, he opened up the flow of power again, and Susan giggled as she quickly reached the levels of power she had this afternoon. It didn't take long, and she felt full of power, while her benefactor seemed only half-depleted - not to mention utterly confused.

"What the hell happened?" he asked. "D-did I power you up more?"

"Indeed, you did!" Susan laughed back as she brought her arms to the bars and easily ripped them out of the window; then she ripped apart the concrete to make the window big enough for her to gracefully hover outside.

"But, why?" the man wondered aloud, more surprised by his own actions than Susan's feat of strength.

"Oh, let me explain," Susan mused as she ripped apart her prison gown to create clothes of her own. Then she looked back into his eyes and once again applied the power in hers. "Because... *You are my slave!*"
