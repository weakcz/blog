"You have got to be kidding me!" Prof. Christopher Harland didn't even try to hide his disappointment.<!--more-->

Jacob couldn't blame him. Even he knew that Harland was always interested in performing an autopsy of a victim of Harland syndrome - as if the name hadn't been a giveaway.

"I'm sorry Professor, but Ms. Riley made herself clear in her will. There's no use complaining about it now." Jacob said this as calmly as he could. He wanted to get as much information as he could from whoever performed the autopsy.

"Detective Spencer is right," came the voice of Prof. Smith - from what Jacob could tell he was the boss here. "Ms. Riley specifically excluded you from performing any autopsy on her, so we should respect her will."

"With all due respect, but I doubt that Ms. Riley even considered the possibility of her mutating when she made that will." Harland waved with a paper that showed some test results that confirmed that Erika Riley had indeed mutated in the same way the Prostitute and the Asian had.

"Unfortunately this doesn't allow us to ignore her decision. We have the permission to perform an autopsy from her brother and all we have to do is respect her will." Smith then turned towards James. "Thompson, you're going to perform it, get any hint about why she mutated in the first place. Together with Harland's results we might find a pattern. I hope you agree with this, Detective Spencer."

Jacob nodded, "I do, but I'd like to be involved in this as well. I found her body due to an unrelated case I wanted to question her about, so I might be of help here."

Professor Smith just shrugged his shoulders and pointed in James' direction. "That's not for me to decide - as long as you don't disturb the other scientists here with their work."

As expected, James didn't turn him down.

 

 

"Why does it have to be so hard?" Michelle sighted. For almost an hour now had she tried to avoid her transformation and she had failed every time.

"You're making progress," Amanda tried to comfort her. The superpowered redhead had assisted her in the training by providing the super energy via skin contact as opposed to the usual drinking of the super potion. Still, whenever Michelle had absorbed enough super energy that she had to store it inside her breasts, her concentration broke and she exploded into her super form immediately.

The only good news so far was that their plan had worked and Michelle's costume now stayed intact even when she transformed back to normal. This way she at least kept her decency after blasting off her first outfit.

"Yeah, I can hold it of a whole second longer than I could an hour ago. And I don't feel like I would get any better than that." Michelle pouted, clearly discouraged by her lack of success.

"Some things need time, and one hour isn't really a long time, after all."

"With super senses it is," Michelle retorted, before realizing that this didn't really help her case. "It's just that... normally I make much quicker progress when I try something related to these powers. This time it just feels like I'm doing it wrong, and repetition won't bring any success. Maybe it even is impossible."

"Or maybe you're just spoiled from your previous success. Since things went rather easy so far, you probably expected some kind of instinct to guide your hand again, right?" Amanda answered. "But what you are trying to do here goes against these very instincts. I naturally prefer my super form over my normal one, after all."

"You're right," Michelle exclaimed. "God you're so right. How could we have missed that part?"

Now Amanda raised her brow indicating she hadn't followed her best friend's trail of thoughts.

"The whole setup for this exercise is wrong!" Michelle began explaining. "You are sharing some of your super energy, while I am accepting it. In other words a part of me downright says that I want to be super at that moment - at the cost of your resources no less!"

"Aren't you overdramatizing here? There's still plenty of super energy left in me, not to mention the potion..."

Michelle shook her head. "That's of no interest for our instincts here. We are supposed to be self-sufficient, remember? You have more super energy than me right now, that's why you can share it with me while my supply is too low to return the favor. While you are consciously doing that to help me train, our instincts see it as me being in a bind and you giving me the necessary power to get back on my feet."

"Sounds plausible, but why can you prevent your transformation then? From this point of view you should transform right once you have enough energy to do so, but you can fill your body to the max - it's only the breasts where you fail."

"Because they serve a different purpose than the rest of our bodies. Just look at yourself right now: Each body cell is filled to the max, but the breasts store more power than the rest of your body. In other words they store the excess energy. So once my 'normal' cells are maxed out, my body refuses to simply store away energy before my super cells are filled as well."

Amanda thought about it. "Fair enough, but wouldn't that mean that it's impossible to prevent a transformation?"

"Not totally, that's for sure. But right now it would suffice to be able to store some super energy in my breasts without transforming. If I manage to do that, I should be able to stay normal for a day at work while still being able to help if danger calls."

"And how do you plan to master that if not the way you tried for the last hour?"

"Let me try something." Michelle folded her legs so she hovered in midair in a lotus position. She slowly descended on the nearby couch and closed her eyes.

Amanda on her part watched her friend intently - not wanting to disturb her concentration. Thanks to her super eyesight, she could see how her best friend slowly willed her super energy into her breasts - something that Amanda considered unnatural for some reason. After a few seconds, the process already came to a halt and Michelle's face showed more and more strain. Amanda saw that every now and then a bit of super energy would try to get back to her chest before slowly returning to her breasts. It seemed like Michelle was playing tug of war with her breasts, each party wanting to dump the super energy onto the other.

The stalemate continued for well over five minutes until suddenly, Michelle's breast began to shrink back down to their original A-cups - which still held the super energy. Then the rest of Michelle's body followed suit, shrinking down to its original form. Just like the previous times, the black leotard shrank accordingly as well.

"Phew, finally managed to do it." Michelle said as she opened her eyes again.

"Wow," Amanda was still surprised at her best friends' sudden success. "You really willed yourself to transform back, but how?"

"In a way I simply convinced my body that this is a more practical form right now. While my super form is without a doubt more powerful in every possible aspect, this form has one major advantage: less power consumption. Once I had completely accepted that, transforming back became rather easy."

Michelle began hovering again, first cautious, but soon relieved that it worked the way she intended to.

"So in other words you can now absorb as much super energy as your normal form can handle, but once you get more, you will transform again. Just … how much are you able to store anyway?"

"There's only one way to find out," Michelle held out a glass and poured herself a bit of super potion. "Cheers."

 

 

"Alright," James exclaimed. "We didn't find anything in her stomach, and there was no hint of an injection on her skin either."

Those had been the first quick tests he had run. James knew about the existence of a super potion, so he had considered this the best possible choices to find a hint. So far he hadn't been able to determine whether the super potion would even leave a trace in her stomach after such a time, but he couldn't openly say this.

"There has to be something," Jacob exclaimed. "People don't just spontaneously mutate like this!"

"Don't get impatient. It'll take time to figure out what changed it, especially since we have no idea how it happened."

"It could be sexually transferrable," Jacob suggested.

"I don't think so, the man who was almost fucked to death by that Asian is frequently tested to check just that. So far there's no sign of him mutating."

"Maybe it only goes one way? So far we only learned about women who mutated this way. What if it was because they had sex with a man of similar powers? You can't rule that out, right?"

"You almost sound desperate." James commented. Normally it was Jacob who would be more levelheaded, so it surprised him all the more. Then again this played into his hands as well. Unlike Harland, Jacob seemed convinced that Erika Riley hadn't transformed because of her encounter with Michelle, but through some different means. James knew that this was true, but lacked scientific proof.

That was the official side, though. James had figured out that Michelle was more than met the eye through a strand of hair he had analyzed. And while this showed that she had the same kind of mutation as the prostitute or the asian woman, it wasn't exactly the same. Knowing that Michelle's powers had come from a super potion created by a plant, James had concluded that the former two had gotten theirs by a different plant of the same species. And so had Erika whose mutation seemed identical to the other two. Despite this knowledge James had no idea how exactly the mutation occurred. From what he heard from Michelle, he theorized that some kind of virus would cause the mutation by using this "super energy" she had mentioned. But since he didn't know any details he had no idea whether there would be a hint to find on Erika.

"Well," Jacob spoke again. "She had noticed a man with rather … extreme physique the day before yesterday that had spoken to a paralyzed Asian girl. I was about to ask her about details since I found it suspicious, but she was dead by then."

"That sounds indeed suspicious," James confirmed. He still didn't believe in sexual transferability because of that - after all that would leave both partners to be siblings on a genetic level. James tried to avoid this trail of thoughts. He needed more information for a valid theory.

 

 

Prof. Christopher Harland was still a bit furious about the fact that he couldn't perform the autopsy on Erika Riley as he continued his autopsy on Jane Doe. If he had to choose, he would've chosen to perform the autopsy on the former rather than the latter, especially since she had been a patient of his before, no matter how short that lasted. Unfortunately the two hadn't gotten along and she had quickly resigned herself to her fate. Back then, Harland hadn't minded it half as much as now since he hadn't expected her to put such a clause into her will. But the situation with both her and her brother had been even more ironic. It had taken barely more than 24 hours after their little arrangement had fallen apart for him to get attacked by one of these women. Mere hours later Erika had encountered the Angel. Harland had looked into these events closely and came to the conclusion that this was a very unfortunate coincidence.

"Day 3, Wednesday 6 p.m." he spoke into his dictating machine. "Subject Jane Doe has been dead for a week now and her d

"So much attention for a dead girl," interrupted a voice.

Harland turned around to see the origin of that voice: A young woman. With her blonde hair and otherworldly physique he assumed for a moment that this was the Angel that had prevented a plane crash last night. But once he saw her eyes, he knew that this wasn't the same woman. Unlike the Angel whose eyes were said to glow blue, this woman had golden eyes. A sense of dread went over him, as he realized how unnatural her eye-color was. And to to confirm his fears, he noticed that she sitting in midair. For some reason he would've preferred the actual Angel over this random woman appearing in the lab. Harland noticed that her clothes were rather ill-fitting. Yoga pants that ended halfway on her calves and what was supposed to be a baggy T-shirt were the only visible clothes, no shoes or socks and - judging by how her nipples were noticeable through the T-shirt - no bra either.

"Who are you?" Harland asked, as his mind raced to put together what he already knew. This woman was obviously another mutant, someone with similar abilities to the Angel, the Redhead and the Asian they had heard of - so far.

The woman laughed. "Some father you are, not even recognizing your own daughter."

"S-Susan?" Harland stammered. Despite all he knew about these superpowered women so far, he hadn't expected his own daughter to join their ranks. Remembering her temper made him doubt that this was a good thing. "What happened to you?"

"Let's just say I got lucky," she giggled as she rose higher in the air. "Really lucky."

"You could say that," Harlands mind raced. Two women with similar powers ended up dead, now he just hoped that Susan wouldn't join them. "But why are you here? Somebody could see you!"

"So what?" Susan countered. "I'm super-hot and I have super powers, of course I want to show them off!"

"Not here! This is a research facility where everybody tries to look into people like you right now. You have to get out of here!"

"What? You want to get rid of me again? That's why you hired my last boyfriends too, right? Or sent me down to the botanic lab? Because I was in your way? You know what? Forget that I was here!"

Unbeknownst to her, her eyes had flashed as she said that last part. Susan then made her way to the door, and left the room without making a single noise.

Her father on the other hand stood there gazing on the space she had occupied during their conversation until she had already closed the doors until eventually wondering why he had interrupted the autopsy.

 

 

"Come on, you can do it!" Amanda cheered as Michelle was desperately struggling to overcome another dose of super potion. Instead of drinking a normal dose of it, Michelle had settled for shot glasses of mini doses to make it easier to handle the sudden increase in super energy. Both women were aware that this limit was about to be reached, the question was just whether this shot or the next would make Michelle explode into her super form. After all, she had drunk about four normal doses worth of super serum.

Amanda’s eyes were fixated on Michelle’s chest. By now, each of Michelle’s A-cup breasts contained more than Amanda’s entire body. With her enhanced sight she could clearly see the intensity of the super energy being on the same level as the potion itself right now.

"S-Something’s wrong," Michelle stammered and Amanda soon saw what she meant. The costume around her breasts vanished and exposed her erect nipples to the world. Before she could even wonder what it was about, she saw something leaking out of them: milk. Amanda blinked her exes as if she needed to confirm what happened, but it was obvious. Her best friend was lactating – a bit. And if that wasn’t strange enough, the milk had the signature glow of super energy.

"What the hell?" Michelle asked once she had gotten herself under control and looked at the two little drops of her own breast milk that had landed on the table.

"Interesting, seems like your body found a way to get rid of excess super energy without causing a transformation," Amanda commented as she carefully touched it. Upon contact, she could feel the super energy entering her body through her fingertips. "W-wow. That feels ... strange." Amanda held her head for a second.

"What do you mean?"

"First it felt like it did when I drank the potion, even better actually. But now my knee kinda hurts."

Without a second thought Michelle activated her X-ray vision, her eyes turning from their original brown to their super blue as she did so. "I don’t see any problem there."

"I see that too, but still it feels like my knee was crushed or something. Maybe some phantom pain from when Erika actually did crush it last night. You know, as payback for when I … Oh my god this is it!" Amanda cheerfully exclaimed.

"This is what?" Michelle was clearly confused as she was still trying to process the fact that her breast milk contained super serum.

"Your individual power! Just like I could use heat vision and Erika was better with the super clothes, you also had an individual talent. And through absorbing the energy that originates from you, I gained this ability as well."

"And what does it have to do with your knee hurting? I never experienced that one."

"But I know someone whose knee should hurt right now: Fred. Ever since you mentioned how you could somehow read your boyfriends’ mind, I secretly hoped that I could use that to figure out what Fred had been hiding from me. I thought it had been a trust problem, but it’s pretty obvious that this is your individual super power. And now that you shared it with me, I can feel what he feels all the way here," Amanda’s expression darkened. "I can feel the pain I myself have caused - and a lot more."

"Hey, don’t let it get you down again," Michelle hovered over to hug her friend. "You did come here in order to find a way to fix not only that, but Fred’s other problems as well, right?"

Amanda nodded. "You’re right. I’m just a bit overwhelmed that I feel his pain now, that’s all. But you’re bringing up a good point." She then released the hug and grabbed the still half-full bottle with super potion. "I should get going and finally start my own research. I want to erase this pain and it won’t be as easy as it was for you to get this transformation bit under control."

Hovering towards the open window, Amanda stopped before leaving. "And Michelle?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you for everything."

With this, the superpowered redhead took off to the skies with full speed. Unlike other times, Michelle had no trouble following her movements until she was out of sight.

 

 

Susan was furious as she hovered through the halls. There was no real reason for her to stay here, but since her father had wanted her to leave, she left obliged to do the very opposite - it was getting late, so most people should have left the facility already. Even after what happened to her, he dared to cast her aside. In a fit of rage, she slammed her fist into the next wall, only to be caught off-guard, by the crushing noise of said wall. Susan looked at the wall, puzzled because her hand didn’t hurt like she had expected, but even more shocked to see the big hole she had created. The whole superpowers part was still new to her and she hadn’t done anything except flying so far. But now she remembered that she was strong enough to lift a plane – at least that’s what the news about that ‘Angel’ had implied. What had he said after she had suddenly turned into this goddess?

"Have fun!"

Yes, that’s what he had said.

"What is going on here?" came a familiar voice from behind her, followed by an "Oh my god!"

"…dess," Susan completed as she turned around towards the newcomer: Deziree Archer, a botanist that had to ‘take care’ of Susan when her father didn’t want her around. Deziree stood there, visibly shocked at the sight. It was no real surprise that the other woman was scared at the sight of Susan. Not after this demonstration of super strength, not to mention the fact that she was still hovering in midair.

"W-who are you?" Deziree stammered confirming that Susan wasn't even recognizable as herself. Her formerly black hair had been replaced by a blonde mane, her face - although pretty - was now absolutely divine as was her whole body. Unfortunately this meant she had to improvise on her wardrobe.

"Who indeed?" Other than with her father, Susan had no interest in ending the masquerade. She hovered closer to Deziree who still stood there frozen in place. The two woman looked each other in the eyes, and Susan enjoyed Deziree's sheer fear as she listened to her panickingly beating heart. "Should you really be standing upright instead of worshipping me?" she teased.

"W-what do you mean?" Deziree's heart almost skipped a beat.

"Don't act dumb, I'm telling you to kiss my feet."

To Susan's surprise, she could clearly hear Deziree's heart rate slow down as her look became dreamy. She then kneeled down and placed a kiss on each of Susan's bare feet. Next, Deziree shook her head, looked first at the feet that hovered before her, then followed the legs upwards to meet Susan's gaze again. While fear were slowly reclaiming Deziree's train of thoughts, she also seemed - confused. As if she didn't know how she had gotten to kneel before Susan in the first place. Quickly, however Deziree averted her eyes.

"You think that was enough?" Susan mocked. "Continue!"

"With what?" Deziree asked as she stood up, still facing away from the blonde superwoman.

"Kissing my feet, obviously!"

Deziree now faced her again, and began to blush. "Th-that happened?"

"I said don't act dumb!" Susan then put her legs around Deziree and made a somersault in midair, catapulting the young botanist throught the hallway, screaming.

 

 

"What is going on?" Jacob asked as the woman's scream reached the lab in which James was performing the autopsy.

James on the other hand was just as clueless as the detective, but that scream was obviously not a good sign. But before he could voice this thought, Jacob had already left the lab to look for the source of that scream.

"Please let it be an escaped lab rat," he commented as he followed as well. He knew that this wasn't very likely to cause such a scream.

A wave of anxiety came over James as they ran through the corridors. What had once been a single scream were now pained moans.

"That's what you get for trying to fool me," a female voice said - and James' anxiety increased exponentially. The next turn revealed the source of the scream: A female scientist - whom James recognized as Deziree Archer - was struggling to get back onto her feet only to get kicked across the hallway and crashing into the wall on the other side.

The kick itself sounded a lot worse than the collision with the wall, and James figured that Dezirees ribcage must've been broken by the force of it. James had no time to verify this theory, as the reason for the other scientists' demise was still hovering in the hallway.

"Alright, hands up!" Jacob ordered, having already pulled out his gun and aimed it at the woman who had just kicked another woman about thirty feet through the hallway - with no leverage whatsoever. The disturbing part of her was her blonde hair which was close enough to Michelle's to fool most people. Fortunately the golden eyes were a clear sign that this was a different woman.

"And if I refuse?" The woman countered. "Do you really think this toy in your hands will have any effect on me?"

Jacob didn't flinch, though. "Do you really think it won't? We've got a bunch of corpses which say otherwise.  This is no comic book, where bullets just bounce off your body."

Talk about a bluff! Jacob was one of the few people that knew for certain that his gun would have no effect on her. But the golden-eyes goddess did indeed seem a bit intimidated here. Both her and Jacob were engulfed in a staring contest, when suddenly her eyes began to glow.

"Drop that gun!"

To James' shock, Jacob actually did what he was told.

"My, aren't you a nice guy," the woman started to laugh, rising in the air as she did so. "Now come here!"

This time, James noticed the strange flash in the woman's eyes and immediately felt the urge to comply. As he watched Jacob stumble towards the woman, James figured out what was happening: The woman was mind-controlling them! A part of him wondered if he was supposed to be aware of this, when he suddenly heard Michelle's voice.

"Snap out of it."

And he did. After only two steps he stopped - right next to Jacob's dropped gun. Michelle however was nowhere to be seen.

He wasted no time and immediately grabbed the gun to point it at the strange woman again. James knew that he was at a clear disadvantage at a staring contest, so he had to hope for the intimidating factor the gun still seemed to possess.

"You point a gun at me, yet you can't look me in the eye," the woman taunted.

But James didn't fall for that. Obviously, her eyes were crucial in this mind-control trick so he couldn't risk eye-contact. Unfortunately he was the only one who had been able to fight off said control, and Jacob was still walking towards her. Just a few more steps and he would be in the line of fire. Time was running against him.

Bang!

James took the little chance he had and fired the gun as long as the line of fire was still free. Since he knew that the bullet wouldn't do any damage, he put his hopes on the short moment of distraction. After all, according to Michelle she had been very distracted the first time she had gotten hit there.

"Oooh," the woman moaned once the bullet bounced off her chest. "Now that's the stuff!"

Before she could recompose herself, James had fired another round. The first bullet had caused Jacob to stumble, the second broke the control completely and the detective turned around. As he went past James, he reached for the gun only to stop himself halfway. Obviously Jacob had realized that he had been mind-controlled and thus not exactly to be trusted with a gun right now.

"Yes!" the woman now directly pointed her chest in James direction - downright urging him to fire again.

James gladly complied. With a nod, Jacob went past him to pick up the still struggling Dr. Archer. Come to think of it, this could be a futile gesture. Once this woman grew tired of being shot at - best case scenario would be for him to run out of bullets - she would have absolutely no problem with catching up to them. The only hope would be for her to not be that interested in further torturing Dr. Archer once she was out of sight. Which was only possible if this women didn't use X-ray vision. As for James himself, things were looking grimmer each time he pulled the trigger. Running would not be an option since she was hovering towards him - whether this was consciously or not he couldn't tell.

 

 

"Do you really think we should leave him alone there?" Deziree asked as they ran through the corridor.

"It's not like we have that many options," answered Jacob. "And if you ask me we better get out of here as soon as possible!"

This was easier said than done. Deziree wasn't exactly the athletic type so running was far from her strong suit. And to make matters worse she was trying to do so wearing heels. For the important meeting this morning she had dressed up and used them to make up for her lack of height. Considering she normally preferred flats, trying to run in heels proved to be a mistake.

"Ah!"

Having misplaced her step, Deziree's right foot broke away under her as she fell to the ground. The pain shooting through it left her little doubt that she had sprained her ankle in the process.

"Hold on!"

Jacob didn't waste much time asking if she was alright, but simply picked her up to carry her the remaining distance to the elevator. Once inside, he put her down and was about to set the elevator to bring them towards the first floor.

"We gotta go to the second basement floor," she announced, holding out her key card to imply that it was needed to reach this level.

"What? The basement isn't exactly a good place to flee to!" Jacob exclaimed, but only half-heartedly. He looked at her more curious than surprised.

Deziree tried to hold his gaze, but eventually shied away, blushing. "My lab is down there."

"And?" Jacob said. "Does it have anything to do with that woman up there that attacked you?"

Biting her lip, Deziree pondered her next statement.

"Well, I don't know for sure, but I have a theory … and it might help us out if I'm right."

"Shoot it!"

 

 

For almost two minutes, James fired bullet after bullet onto the mysterious woman, each of them causing her to moan in delight and buying him a few more seconds before he had to fire the next one. He was actually surprised that this distraction worked this well, considering that Michelle had been distracted by a bullet once and never again. The situation was bizarre enough as it was.

Despite him taking as much time between shots as possible, eventually the loud bang of the gun was replaced by a click that meant that James was out of bullets.

"Over already?" The woman seemed even more disappointed about this than James was. Her lips curled into a wicked smile and James didn't need to guess that her eyes were still fixed on him. He still needed to avoid eye-contact after all, and the fact that the bullets had turned her shirt into Swiss cheese in the chest area made it awfully easy to do so. Could it get even more ironic? He had been dating Michelle for two days now and was already actively trying to avoid eye contact with another woman by staring at said woman's breasts. Not to mention that he had deliberately turned her on. And now he was running out of options.

"Don't beat yourself up because of that", he heard Michelle's voice in the back of his head.

Was he starting to hallucinate now? Earlier when he had broken out of the mind control, he had heard her voice too. But this time it felt stronger, almost like the time Michelle had shown him the past event's through her very own memories.

"Why are you stepping away from me?" The woman asked seductively. Still James could hear a hint of annoyance in her voice. "You turn me on and then you run away? How impolite. And you're staring at my tits to boot."

James continued to step backwards while the woman floated closer to him.

"I'm actually trying to … uhm ... assess the damage done to your body," he bluffed.

"Why do I find it hard to believe?"

James was really running out of arguments now. As if on cue he reached the wall. Instead of taking a turn he had trapped himself. The woman was so close, he could smell her already. Didn't help that her scent was similar to Michelle's. Probably the same kind of super pheromones, which means I'm screwed. "You see, I have a girlfriend..."

"Do you think I care?" She picked him up by the collar, and as he still struggled to avoid eye contact, she held his chin in place with her remaining hand. "You're going to finish what you started and you won't care about your girlfriend while we're at it. If you're good, I might let you live and you can tell her about how you were with a woman that outmatches her in every possible aspect."

"Yeah, I'm not so sure about that." James struggled to say that. Her pheromones and her hypnotic eyes were eating away his reasoning. It was a downright miracle she hadn't turned him into a mindless slave yet. Still, as much as her attempts had grown, so had his resistance.

"Oh? Are you calling me a liar?" The woman snarked. "I really do consider letting you live, but if you struggle like that, the chances are decreasing! What would your precious litte girlfriend say if you wasted your life like this?"

Before James could even think of an answer the wall next to them exploded. All he could see was an arm grabbing the woman before him before the next wall exploded with both her and the newcomer disappearing. And even though he had not been able to see more than a blur here, he clearly felt who the newcomer was.

 

 

Jacob stared through the thick security glass to watch the strange plant behind it.

"So you're saying that this thing might be the reason behind the mutations?"

"Not this one specifically," Deziree explained. "But one or more plants just like that. It's DNA consists of 54 chromosomes which is exactly the amount of extra chromosomes found in the mutated women."

As she spoke, her hands were working on the console, and after a few seconds the plant disappeared behind a thick steel plate.

"Ok, the plant is sealed," she tried to sound as confident as possible. "Although I doubt it will slow down someone as strong as her."

"Sealing it will at least hide the plant," Jacob commented.

"Yeah, but with our luck she also has X-ray vision or something like that to spot it anyway."

"There's nothing more that we could do to prevent that if that were the case. So there's no reason to feel down because of it."

"Sorry, today hasn't exactly been my day," Deziree sheepishly admitted. "We … uhm, gotta seal of something else too."

She noted at another console and Jacob took the hint as he helped her to reach it - thanks to her twisted ankle she had trouble walking, after all.

"You mean those containers? What exactly is in there?"

"Some liquid that the plant was producing. In my theory it would be what causes the mutations."

"And judging by that Asian’s victim the mutations include super powers."

"That’s the current theory. But as I said, my analysis wasn't even close to indicate this liquid is the actual catalyst. It’s just the only part of the plant that can be consumed in one way."

"Just to see that I got this right: this container contains possibly superpower-granting stuff."

Deziree bit her lips again. "You think about using the stuff instead of sealing it away, right?"

 

 

After a few layers of concrete Michelle dropped the other woman into a large storage room. Her pulse raced. Thanks to her mental bond with James, she had immediately known about his predicament. The first thing she did was to drink a large dose of super serum, which meant that her body now buzzed with more power than ever. That wasn't the only reason why her pulse raced. This was her first fight with another superhuman person, a whole different league than the criminals she had dealt before. But most importantly: this woman had dared to threaten her boyfriend.

Michelle eyed her enemy. The woman looked much more like her than she liked to admit. The differences in their physique were minimal, probably unnoticeable by any normal human. Their hair however had the exact same color, which didn't really surprise Michelle since she knew that the hair was completely affected by the super energy coursing through them. Speaking of which, Michelle was glad to notice that the other woman had only a good dose worth of super energy left, about a quarter of what Michelle sported right now.

The only difference visible for normal humans however were the eyes. Where Michelle's were blue and despite their glow could pass on as a normal human being, her counterpart had golden orbs that made it really clear that this was no ordinary woman.

"Now look at that, you ruined my outfit!" the other blonde complained as she assessed the damage. She wasn't kidding as unlike her body, her clothes weren't meant to be thrown through several layers of concrete. Now her shirt was barely more than rags while Michelle's own costume wasn't even dirty. "What? No apology?"

"Did you really expect any?" Michelle countered. "A few seconds ago you deliberately let yourself get shot and now you complain about clothing damage?"

"Maybe I should ruin your clothes then, seems only fair after you attacked me out of the blue."

The other woman jumped at her, but Michelle had already activated her super senses. With her perception increased, the quick attack now happened in slow motion, allowing her to easily dodge it.

A punch followed next, but Michelle's movements were just as quick as her reaction.

Angry, the other blonde tried to kick Michelle, who gladly grabbed her foot mid-kick and threw her attacker into a shelf and the wall behind it. The shelf and anything on it was destroyed on impact and the wall itself suffered too, but as expected the blonde stranger got back up immediately.

By now, Michelle's speed advantage became obvious. Her activated super senses came with the added benefit that her body also reacted quicker to her commands.

The other blonde didn't seem to bother too much as she took her time checking her body for wounds that weren't there. This woman was clearly new to these powers.

"How about you give up and tell me how you got these powers?" Michelle asked.

"As if!" the other woman flew into her direction again, launching another ray of punches of which none hit their intended target. Each missing punch only served to increase the womans anger however.

"Hold still!" she shouted and her eyes flashed with a golden burst of super energy.

Thanks to her mental connection with James, Michelle already knew what this meant. This woman had some mind-controlling powers that she was now trying to use subconsciously. The same mental connection had allowed her to break this control on James from afar and naturally, Michelle herself was in no danger of being affected.

Another swing, and again Michelle had little trouble dodging it. As she ducked under the attack, Michelle decided to go on the offense again. She clenched her fist, her whole right arm building up power before she slammed it into her opponents belly with full force.

Boom.

A millisecond later Michelle was alone in the room. Her arm was still stretched out, and she noticed that it had grown in definition right before the punch as it was now shrinking down to it's previous size. Her opponent however had been punched through several walls again.

 

 

"Number three sealed," Deziree commented again as the container vanished into the underground vault. Now there was only one container left and the decision about whether to seal it or take the chance that it would grant them super powers.

Jacob held the last container in his hand and it was clear that he was still pondering about what to do with it as well. If they drank it, they would most likely be able to hold their own against the blonde stranger, but there were at least two corpses that told a different story.

Suddenly there were a series of loud booms that shoot the building, each one getting closer to their position until finally, the wall exploded as their blonde attacker fell through it to land on the floor, sliding over it before finally coming to a stop.

Deziree's eyes widened in shock. For a second she was convinced that this woman had searched and found them. But then she noticed that her entrance didn't seem to have been voluntary. The woman was about to get up and Deziree gulped as she realized that her clothes were all but destroyed. Her yoga pants were ragged and cut - while the legs they covered didn't so much as show a scratch. As for the baggy T-shirt she had been wearing - that was nowhere to be seen. A wave of jealousy overcame Deziree as she watched the other woman's naked upper body. The slender waist, hard cut abs and then the enormous breasts - compared to the incredible powers this just seemed unfair to Deziree.

Still, kneeling on the floor, the woman lifted her hand and slammed it into the ground.

"DAMMIT!" she cursed, as her fist shattered the floor. The force of her punch caused the ground to shake which - combined with her sprained ankle - made it impossible for Deziree to keep her balance and she fell to the ground.

The woman then looked around, spotting Jacob who had managed to keep his balance there. Deziree however was mostly hidden behind the table.

"Oh my, you again," she commented. Her voice had suddenly turned sweet and flirty again, a stark contrast to the curse she had spewed in her outburst. She began to walk into his direction, but after a few steps she became airborne with a wicked smile upon her face. "Like what you see?" she said as she basically stuck out her oversized breasts in Jacobs direction. "Now come to me!"

Deziree didn't need to see it to know that this woman was once again using her mind control powers on him. And to her horror, Jacob began walking towards her - the container with the plant liquid still in hand.

"What are you carrying there?"

Jacob didn't answer as he walked towards her.

"Answer me!" she added annoyed.

"The liquid extracted from an alien plant, which seems to be the source of super powers just as yours." Jacob said in a flat, robotic manner.

The woman's golden eyes widened as she heard that. "Give it to me!"

Jacob complied.

Behind her table, Deziree watched in horror, as the blonde woman opened the container, peeked inside and spouted a manic grin. "Oh yeah, I know that glow!" she said before putting it towards her mouth. The container was big enough to hold three liters of liquid and was made of solid steel - heavy enough for Deziree to have problems when dealing with it. This woman however used it as if it was just a small bottle as she began to drink it's contents.

For several seconds, the only sound that was to be heard were her gulping noises. And even though this was the worst thing that could happen, Deziree looked at the scene with curiosity.

The woman hovered a bit higher, but otherwise nothing seemed to happen. Then suddenly, the blonde woman dropped the container, clutching her chest as she released a slight moan. All over her body she seemed to gain even more definition, her arms and legs growing in size and the latter tore the remainder of her pants apart. Then the process reversed itself, as her body began to emit a slight bluish glow.

"Too much," she panted as she grabbed her breasts firmly, her legs kicking aimlessly through the air. Unfortunately Jacob still seemed to be dazed by her mind control as he didn't even try to dodge as one accidental kick sent him flying across the room to collapse against the wall, passing out.

Deziree could see that the other woman's nipples were getting erect and with another firm grip began to leak milk that began to drip on the ground. "Why on earth is she starting to lactate now?" she thought to herself.

A few seconds later, the flow of milk had subsided already, though the puddle on the floor was noticeable. As for the woman, she let out a sigh of release as she straightened herself up in midair. The glow on her body faded away as well.

"Much better," she commented as she flexed her arms who suddenly grew in size again. "Yup, I am at the absolute peak of what my body can handle. Now that 'Angel' bitch won't stand a chance."

Deziree gasped as she heard that. The 'Angel' was here? She barely had time to finish that thought as her gasp hadn't gone unnoticed. The woman turned towards her, slowly hovering into her direction.

"Now look at that, little Deziree hides under the table!"

She couldn't believe her ears. "W-who are you?"

"Oh right, I don't look like before, don't I? It's Susan."

Deziree desperately tried to get away, but with her movement limited to crawling, her chances were slim.

The woman picked up the table with one hand and looked at her with a crazed smile.

"If you're crawling like a cockroach, I should smash you like one."

With that she used the table as an oversized club and swung it at her.

Deziree's life flashed in front of her eyes.

And one moment later she stared into the glowing blue eyes of another goddess. She didn't even have time to get lost in the sudden closeness with the newly arrived woman as Susan hit her with the table in the back. The metallic table screamed as it contorted against the woman's body. Deziree wasn't surprised that her savior was utterly unimpressed by that.

"Are you alright?" she asked.

Something about her calmed Deziree down, comforted her. She nodded and didn't object as the woman picked her up and … the next moment she heard another slam shaking the building from the other side of the room. Looking at the source, she was surprised to see that "the other side of the room" was where she had been lying just a second ago - Susan had donned the distorted table and tried to punch both her and the 'Angel' protecting her.

Her thoughts raced, even if the 'Angel' was able to dodge Susan's punch, how could she carry Deziree to safety as well? Her body shouldn't be able to withstand the forces at play here.

"What... how?" she began.

"Don't worry," said the woman as she put her down.

 

 

Michelle used her X-ray vision to check the woman she had just saved for injuries, and found her ankle to be twisted. Naturally she wanted to fix the injury - or at least help with the injury, but...

"Hey!" the other blonde shouted. "Are you just going to ignore me?"

Turning around, Michelle confirmed what the quick glances earlier had suggested. This woman had somehow gotten her hands on a huge amount of super energy as her body was filled to the brim with it. If she wanted to win this one, she needed a plan - and a good one. Either get her hands on some more super energy or have her enemy burn through her amount. In a close up fight, Michelle had already proven that she had an advantage, something that wouldn't change by the other having more energy at her disposal. Still, having to protect others would be a huge disadvantage in the long run.

Michelle charged her enemy, crossing the distance quickly by combining her initial jump with her flight powers. Thanks to her senses working in overdrive, she saw her enemy preparing a counterattack based on Michelle's attack path. Of course she couldn't have that. Right before the other blonde's fist would hit her face, Michelle dodged with the help of her flight powers.

The woman's punched the air and struggled to keep her balance. Michelle used the opportunity to touch down on the floor and use the leverage to give extra force to he kick that sent her enemy flying through the same series of walls that had brought her here.

Now time was of essence. Michelle had already wasted precious time when she had kicked Susan here and couldn't afford to do so again. She rushed over to the woman, and tended to her twisted ankle. Quickly she moved the lower part of the woman's stockings and concentrated on creating a bandage around her ankle. The bandage pulled itself tight, yet Michelle knew that it was only a small help here. Her previous sharing her invulnerability had done more for that woman. As she thought about that, Michelle found that she could enhance her newly created bandage a bit. Willing a small amount of her super energy into it, she caused it to leak some of it as invulnerability into the woman. The amount was small enough, that it was barely more than a painkiller.

"That should help you to get out of here," Michelle concluded, before following her opponent through the hole in the wall. The first time she had taken her time trying to follow her with X-ray vision, only to find that it was impaired by the thick walls. Those were thick enough to qualify for a bunker and probably contained lead.

 

 

Susan finally got to a stop again, after crashing through several of these thick walls. She had always wondered why the basement was so high security, but now it was downright annoying to be punched through the thick walls. No, more than that it truly stung. Ever since gaining these powers she hadn't felt pain, but this 'Angel' had taught her otherwise. This woman had some nasty punches that ironically managed to hurt her. But when Susan looked at the part of her body that had hurt, there was no wound - not anymore. It felt to her like the damage was dealt, but healed immediately as opposed to the bullets that hadn't penetrated her skin in the slightest.

To Susan this simply meant that one super could hurt another and that her added powers didn't make her immune to that either. The problem was that despite her efforts and quick reaction, the 'Angel' moved so much quicker than her, that she seemed impossible to hit. Looking back through the hole she had come through, she didn't see the other blonde.

"Probably she's taking her time again," Susan thought, still eyeing the hole.

Seconds passed but there was no sight of her. Susan was perfectly able to see back into the lab from which she had been punched here, but there was no sign of the 'Angel'. Then it hit her: she was back where their first brawl had started, so there where two series' of holes that connected the two rooms.

Unfortunately this was when the 'Angel' hit her as well. A slight kick to the legs made Susan struggle for balance and instinctively begin to hover. Before she knew it she was hovering horizontally and utterly defenseless as the 'Angel's punched her into the stomach again. This time her involuntary flight through the buildings walls wasn't horizontally, but vertically passing several levels before shooting through the roof.

Just as she had regained her bearing, the 'Angel' had caught up to her already. This time however she stopped hovering several feet from her.

"Have enough?" she asked with a serious tone.

"Never!" Susan spat back, although she was getting desperate. This woman had caused quite a bit of damage while she herself hadn't landed a single hit yet.

"Alright, have it your way!"

The 'Angel' launched another attack, and Susan's braced herself from the hit that was sure to happen by flexing her muscles. For the first time she noticed how her muscle mass increased through that as she quickly took on the proportions fitting for a female bodybuilder.

Boom.

The punch hit, causing Susan to shoot through the late afternoon sky. But that was all there was to it. No pain this time. Susan smiled. It was just logical that flexing her abs in defense countered the punch and thus avoided damage. And without damage, she felt that the energy she had lost was a lot less than before. Another look at her enemy and Susan smiled even further. She was beginning to figure out how much energy it took for the 'Angel' to land a punch - and it was about roughly the same amount Susan had lost receiving it. In short it made no difference whethe she was the one giving or receiving the punches, the winner would be the one who lasted longer. And thanks to her refilling on the potion earlier, Susan had the advantage here.

Apparently the 'Angel' had reached the same conclusion. While she did catch up to Susan, she also kept a certain distance, watching the golden-eyed blonde as if to determine a new strategy. Eventually she spoke up.

"Aren't you going to change into something less... revealing?"

Feeling the air on her bare skin, Susan was once again reminded that she was naked. Her clothes hadn't withstood the fight at all. The 'Angel' however didn't have that problem. "What do you mean with that?"

"I'm tired of fighting a naked woman, that's all. Especially when that women only needs to will some clothes into existence."

Now that was odd. Susan took a further look at the 'Angel's getup. Her black leotard seemed to be as good as new - albeit dirty now. And the ballerinas - considering the forces at play, these shoes should have flown off her feet long ago. How come they still stuck to them? And why didn't the 'Angel' wear boots instead, unlike her she seems to have been super long enough to buy herself a pair. Susan figured that this was a trap.

"Ah yeah, and while I'm at it you're going to sucker punch me. How stupid do you think I am?"

The 'Angel' sighed, hovering backwards slowly to increase the distance between them. "Say stop if I'm far enough away. Or come at me in case you simply can't do it. I could only do something plain like this, after all."

Susan wasn't convinced yet. There had to be a catch to this sudden friendliness. When it came to flying, Susan would consider herself quite good already, but this woman outshined her there as well. There was no telling how quickly she would be able to cross the distance, after all.

Deciding to keep her guard up, Susan tried to will some clothes into existence while still being on the fence. Quickly she felt some fabric appear on her skin, but at the same time became aware of the problem here: Creating clothes was quite energy-consuming.

"Trying to get me waste my powers on creating clothes, are we?"

"Well it was worth hoping you'd go over the top and go for something flashy, but you're not much more creative than I am, right Susan?"

Hearing her own name surprised her, but then Susan remembered that she had imagined clothes that were basically a copy of the 'Angel's leotard, except with "Super Susan" written on the chest. Still, curiosity got the better of her and she looked down to verify that she was indeed wearing the leotard she had imagined. Truth be told, she was looking forward to trying herself on some more complex clothes, but first she needed to take care of this wannabe-superheroine here.

Susan looked up again. She had used precious seconds to stare her clothes that her enemy could have used to initiate an attack. If fact, Susan had fully expected her too and thus never lowered her defense. But the 'Angel' was still locked in place, hovering above the skyline, arms crossed and with a confident smile.

"Since I was so kind to tell you my name, how about you tell me yours?" Susan teased.

"Apparently everybody calls me 'Angel'. Not that I chose that name, but to be honest I can't think of anything better. And believe me, I tried. In the end I just decided to go with whatever the press throws at me." The 'Angel' sounded awfully calm as she explained it.

"I know how the press calls you, but I want your real name!" Susan was getting irritated. Something about this situation creeped her out. This woman had attacked her out of nowhere, relentlessly making one hit after another, yet here she was playing it cool and having a chat? Was she trying to find a strategy or did she attempt to provoke an attack by Susan that she could easily counter?

"My real name? I don't think I want that to become public knowledge. You see, once I've kicked your ass you will spend a long time with the police and I can imagine they want to know my name as well. But if you REALLY want to know, then I might reconsider if you tell me how you got your hands on these powers."

Susan began to laugh. "You've got to be kidding me! Kicking my ass? I've got twice as much of this energy inside me than you have." She showed off her oversized biceps. "And I am strong enough to shrug off anything you throw at me!"

"Yes, I can see that." The 'Angel' was just as calm and collected as before.

How could this woman still be so confident in winning? Susan became anxious again. She had found a way to counter anything that woman had thrown at her so far, so what was she missing? As long as she kept her muscles flexed, she was save, wasn't she?

Susan's eyes widened as she realized what was wrong. Keeping her muscles in their oversized form was a valid defense, but it did come with a prize. She was using up a lot of super energy just to keep them in this state.

"You were stalling me the entire time!" Susan angrily concluded.

"When we got up here, you had three times as much energy than I had. Actually I am surprised that you noticed the high energy consumption of creating clothes but failed to see the constant flexing you're doing there burning up your stamina. You must be pretty dense."

"Ah!" Susan cried out as she charged the other woman. She knew that this was basically the only course of action she had left. This woman had totally and utterly fooled her, but she wouldn't let her rage blind her. Attacking her and landing a hit was her only chance to win. She couldn't let her guard down as this would allow her enemy to punch her around again, but she couldn't play for time either. Pretending to be blind with rage was the only strategy she could come up with and hope that the other woman would underestimate her.

Off course, the 'Angel' dodged her attacks with ease. Susan knew that this would happen and kept punching and kicking the air, trying to read her opponents movements, to predict her next dodge. Eventually, she found an opening that she used to slam her fist right into the 'Angel's abdomen.

Boom.

That sound was music to Susan's ears. Finally she had landed a hit and the 'Angel' was the one experiencing the uncontrolled flight through the air.

But that didn't happen. With horror, Susan realized that her punch had dealt zero damage and quickly understood why: The 'Angel' had used the very same trick she had and flexed her abs right before the punch. On top of that however, she had kept herself in position instead of flying aimlessly through the sky. It took Susan a second to realize that she had anchored herself with some expert use of her flight powers. Through the corner of her eye she saw the 'Angel's fist approaching and for a split second the world turned black.

The initial punch to the face broke Susan's concentration and with it her defense. As she stopped flexing, her muscles shrank back in size and before she could do something about it, another punch or kick would hit her, propelling her over the sky. This repeated several timed. The pain from one punch would barely subside before another would hit her. Despite punching her all over the sky, the 'Angel' seemed to have no problem catching up her and deliver another punch.

For several minutes that felt like eternity, Susan was trapped in a world of pain until finally, instead of delivering another kick, the Angel grabbed her by the throat, and held her up high.

"Ready to give up now?" she asked again.

Susan felt a strange, dragging sensation from where the 'Angel' grabbed her throat. She noticed that the woman was trying to suck out the super energy from her and once she realized that, she managed to interrupt that process.

"This can go two ways: You either cease your struggling, I depower you and hand you over to the police. Or I could continue beating you up until you are out of power - and I can't promise that you'd survive that."

Panic set in and Susan instinctively shielded herself even more from the other woman's attempt to suck the super energy out of her. After a few seconds, though she calmed down enough to actually consider her alternatives.

 

 

Michelle watched Susan intently as the latter tried to come to a conclusion. She was a bit surprised at how superior she had turned out to be, but right now she needed to stay focused on the task at hand. Even though she had found it was technical possible to suck out the super energy from her enemy, the latter's instincts foiled these plans almost immediately. This was no true surprise, though. If she wanted to depower Susan without risking to kill her, she would need her cooperation.

Susan let out a sigh and immediately, Michelle could feel the latter's power flow into her. She loosened her grip on the other woman's throat to avoid crushing it the moment Susan would be depowered. The power transfusion took a bit longer than Michelle had expected as Susan was still reluctant on giving up her powers. She couldn't blame her and short while later, Michelle felt the other woman begin to shake and shiver in her grasp.

"C-c-c-cold," was all the other woman managed to say and Michelle realized that their fight had brought them to the upper atmosphere where warms and oxygen were rather sparse. Quickly, she began to descend, not wanting to risk giving Susan a bit of energy to cope with this, Michelle took the other woman into a warming embrace instead.

The real strange thing however was Susan's appearance. Despite having no super energy in here body anymore, she didn't revert to however she looked originally. This concerned Michelle. After all, she had just absorbed Susan's super energy and with it any powers that were exclusive to her. She knew about Susan having some kind of mind-control powers that she was positive were now her own as well - for all it was worth. If her lack of transforming back was in any way related to such a power, then she herself would be stuck in her super form as well. She tried not to overthink it too much, as she would now have to leave Susan with the police and needed to think about what to say.

 

 

"Did someone get the number of that truck?" Jacob exclaimed as he regained consciousness. Even though he meant it as a joke, he surely felt like he had been struck by a truck

"Actually the driver introduced herself," Deziree joked back as she pulled back the bandage she had been using on his arm. It didn't exactly feel like a deep wound, but Jacob appreciated the first aid he was receiving.

"What happened? I remember us sealing this liquid, then the blonde devil appear here, but after that things get fuzzy."

"She mind-controlled you in giving her the liquid which seemed to power her up. You got hit by accident and lost consciousness. You're lucky that you weren't seriously injured."

"Considering how this day went, my luck had to kick in at one point." He looked at Deziree. "Sorry, I think during all the trouble I forgot to introduce myself: Jacob Spencer."

"It's Deziree Archer," she answered before shyly averting her eyes. "You can call me Deziree."

"Thank you, Deziree,"

"For what?" she blushed

Jacob pointed at the bandage on his arm. "For patching me up, for example. Considering how weird the situation was, it takes a lot to keep calm enough to do that." He then took notice of her also bandaged leg. "How's your ankle doing?"

"Oh that? I'm fine for some reason. It's a bit hard to explain, the 'Angel' showed up, and magically created the bandage and then she disappeared to take care of Susan."

"The 'Angel'? You mean the real deal not the blonde psychopath? And who is Susan."

"Susan is the blonde psychopath. She introduced herself before … she tried to kill me." Deziree shuddered at the thought, tears forming in her eyes. "If not for the 'Angel's appearance, I would be dead by now..."

Jacob leaned over to hug the young scientist. He knew that today's events would be quite traumatic for her, and was relieved that she returned the hug. "It's ok," he whispered.

"Ahem..." another voice broke the silence, as James entered the scene.

Deziree reacted by releasing the hug immediately.

"D-Dr. Thompson, g-good to see you," she stammered, obviously too embarrassed.

"How did you manage to escape that blonde psycho?" Jacob asked.

"Divine intervention," James began before explaining what happened after they had been separated. "… Just when I thought I was totally screwed, the walls exploded and she was gone, probably facing off against someone her own size. And judging by the destruction here, it seems like you saw part of the show as well. But why were you here?"

"We tried to seal off some kind of plant that Deziree here thought responsible for the appearance of these superpowered women. And apparently her theory was right."

"Well... yeah," Deziree blushed, adjusting her glasses before she tried to explain. "I noticed that the added chromosomes on the mutated women were the same number as the chromosomes this plant possessed which could mean that the women were more or less human-plant hybrids."

James' eyes widened. "Where exactly did this plant come from?"

"Uhm, we found the seeds for it inside the meteor."

"And when exactly did you intent to mention that? I'm on field duty looking for stuff like this and nobody mentioned that the meteor actually contained an alien life form!"

Deziree was visibly intimidated by that as she backed away from him a bit.

"Yo Thompson," Jacob interfered. "It's not her fault that your higher-ups keep you in the grey, so don't get mad at her for that. In fact, Deziree's quick decision may have prevented worse from happening."

Both James and Deziree looked at him surprised, but James eventually nodded.

"Sorry for that outburst. It's true that I'm a bit frustrated to be kept out of the loop with something big as that."

Deziree nodded as well. "It's alright, I know that feeling. After all, I didn't learn about this 'Angel' until this morning when she dominated the news. Had to try and put a lot of pieces together since then."

"Well I'm looking forward to see what else you figured out on that plant."

"Actually not that much," Deziree explained. "The thing produces a strange liquid that apparently is responsible for these superhumans, but other than that there's not much to say. I can give you a filed report tomorrow if you want."

James nodded. "That would suffice, I still have to finish an autopsy after all and once I'm done it would be good to compare the results."

"So Deziree, I know that this isn't exactly a comfortable question, but do you have any idea why this Susan was out to kill you?" Jacob asked.

Deziree shook her head. "I can't say I liked her to begin with, but I didn't give her any specific reason to hate me, either. If you ask me she's just pissed off at the world after the recent break-up."

"Break-up?" Jacob repeated. "From whom?"

"Uhm, if I understood it correctly it was the guy who was attacked by the redhead, I think his name was Riley or something. At least he was one of the guys attacked."

Now that was one interesting piece of information. "Fred Riley, whose sister's corpse we have lying up in the lab for an autopsy..." Jacob thought aloud. "this can't be a coincidence."

Deziree's eyes widened as she heard about the connection.

"Detective Spencer?"

Everybody turned around to the new voice who had spoken just now. It was the 'Angel', holding in her arms the very woman that had caused this mess. "I'd like to turn in a criminal," she exclaimed.

Jacob looked at the two blonde women trying to process this exclamation. Considering the strength this Susan possessed, he didn't believe handcuffs would do any good here.

"It's ok, she is powerless right now," the 'Angel' seemed to read their collective thoughts. "Although I am a bit surprised that she still looks this way."

"C-could s-someone lend me y-you k-know clothes? My outfit kinda disappeared along with my powers." Susan stammered. Now Jacob realized that this wasn't caused by some sudden drop in confidence but rather the simple fact that she was still naked - or again? Whatever the case, she was freezing.

"Here," Deziree threw her a lab coat to cover herself up, but otherwise kept a reserved expression.

Once she was at least somehow covered-up, Jacob put the handcuffs on her. Against his expectations, the 'Angel' didn't fly off right away but walked over to the table where the last container still stood.

"I hope you don't mind if I take this with me?" she asked rhetorically.

"Well... uhm … go ahead … it's not like we could prevent you." Deziree stammered, clearly intimidated by the god-like woman before her.

"I still appreciate your cooperation." The woman's calm words made Deziree blush.

When Jacobs tried to focus on the 'Angel' and her strange request again, a gust of wind blew in his direction as the 'Angel' disappeared in a blur - and the container along with her.

The aftermath of the whole incident went by like a dream for Deziree. Once the security was informed about the damage, Deziree took her bag and made her way home to recover from this incident at home. James went to continue the autopsy he had interrupted while Jacob accompanied her upstairs, with the still handcuffed Susan in tow.

"What a strange day," Jacob exclaimed as they walked.

"Yeah," Deziree nodded.

"Hey, … uhm, how about we grab a cup of coffee together? Not today, of course," Jacob nodded towards Susan who just rolled her eyes in a disapproving manner. "Maybe when I stop by here tomorrow morning?"

Deziree looked at him dumbfounded. "Yes, t-that would be nice."

"Great, I'll stop by in your lab tomorrow then."

They soon reached the exit and their paths separated there. Jacob pulled Susan to his car, while Deziree made her way to the bus station. She thought about how the day had went so far. From the sudden news about a real life superheroine to her less than successful flirt with Dr. Thompson, and her encounter with a super-powered Susan Harland, not to mention said superheroine coming and saving the day. And now she even had a small date with the cute cop. Her day had turned out quite well after all.

She held her handbag close to herself and was revarded with the sound of two vials hitting each other inside. Deziree's face lit up with a genuine smile. After all, today wasn't over yet.
