Mac's Pod on Taylor's Island completes, the three "new" pods on Mermaid Island begin their changes, the world comes another step closer to discovering the mers.

<!--more-->

I used to be a man, Bonnie thought as her legs stiffened and her arms lifted away from her sides. She remembered a similar swirling of energy within her body when she started her change in gender a scant three days previously. Then, it started as a tiny tingle that grew more powerful, shifting her mental state so thoroughly that it surprised her even though she was ready for the change. Now, the changes were still surprising, and the feelings encompassed her entire body. If a Navy man had to become a woman, it's best she be a mermaid, Bonnie thought with irony.

She felt frozen, her eyes locked with Annette's, but sensing Joy and Mac as they hummed and stroked her body. Bonnie saw the spark of awareness in Annette's immobile eyes, her mouth frozen in a post-sexual smile, and she imagined her own face looked quite similar. She knew her body was spinning, propelled by the shimmering embrace of thousands of tiny bubbles as the microorganisms began their work.

Although unable to move her body, she felt every inch of it. The energy from Mac and Joy's mer organs pressed on her like a heavy blanket, covering her entire body. There was a sweet eroticism in that pressure, knowing she was unable to resist their invisible touch. It seemed similar to the first moment when she capitulated in Mac's embrace, feeling the power and control radiating from his body while it squeezed out from her own. Wrapped in his arms on the floor of the tank viewing room, the powerful energies overwhelmed and transformed her emotional and sexual feelings. Now, floating and spinning in the tank, the changes were merely physical.

Merely, she thought with a silent laugh! The changes were stretching; almost pulling her legs, as they prepared to merge. Her hips were also stretching painfully, her pelvic passage opening wider so that one day she might carry a baby mermaid through to term. Slowly, her slim Vargas girl hips expanded closer to Annette's generous proportions, but the wash of siren cells flowing through her body quickly overwhelmed the discomfort from her hips. Her already generous breasts expanded, the rising bubbles caressing her firm, round flesh as they flowed past her developing curves.

She had no sense of time passing. She only knew that her body kept changing. The pressure in her legs eased as the skin between them dissolved while her muscles wove themselves together in new configurations. A series of sharp, quick jabs of pain accompanied the shifting of her leg bones into the segmented, single limb of a mermaid. She couldn’t feel the new connections growing between her knees or ankles, only the blanket of pressure continuing as new fins pushed out from her elbows, hips, and former knees. Her feet began to spread out into the classic fantail flukes of a mermaid. In her lower torso, her womb expanded as her vaginal opening moved forward and a bit lower to the surface of her tail.

Although she couldn’t look anywhere else other than Annette’s eyes, she sensed both her own and Annette’s hair growing longer. Her lover’s hair turned brown, like her own, she thought. Ripples of energy raced over her entire body as her skin cells transformed into chromatophores that would keep her hidden. Finally, a great spasm gripped her, an intensely pleasurable stab forcing her body into a backwards circle, her new flukes arching up behind her, quivering over her head. She blinked and her camouflage snapped on--all over her body--and finally, she relaxed in the water.

Her mer-senses came on-line, like eyes growing used to light after a long period of blindness. It took a few seconds, before sensing her three pod-mates, as well as hundreds of fish sharing the tank, but she focused on the power and clarity of Annette’s, Joy’s, and Mac’s signals in those first moments. Her heart swelled as she plumbed the depths of this new connection, feeling the warm and colorful energy crackling through her entire body.

She looked down at her long tail, her new fins slowly brushing back in forth, her body’s autonomic systems keeping her steady and balanced. Her impressive breasts partially blocked her view, but because of her camouflage, they mostly looked like the bottom of the tank. She glanced up at Annette and recognized that while she could see her mate clearly, Annette’s skin was also broadcasting the fish, rocks, and fauna behind her in the tank.

As she looked at the shimmering beauty that Annette had become, Bonnie felt a new power wash over her and intense need rose up from her new womb. Heat flared up in both her chest and her tail as her bioluminescence flickered to life for the first time. Annette’s body responded as well, and they both turned towards Mac. Joy positioned herself along one of his fins and ran one hand along his magnificent cock. Annette swam over to the other fin, smiling at Bonnie, and pressing her own vent over Mac’s vibrating fin.

“You’re technically the virgin here,” Annette said. “You should have the honor.”

Unconsciously, Bonnie reacted to Mac’s powerful body, her fins pushing her towards him without thought. He reached out and guided her hips towards his, stopping her when his penis softly speared her still opening vent. He moved her hips in gentle circles, stimulating her body, sending her need higher and higher. Bonnie’s flukes caressed Mac’s lower tail, feeling overwhelmed by the sensuousness of the tactile perception of her flukes fluttering against something. Joy and Annette ran their fingers lightly along Bonnie’s shoulders, arms, elbow fins, and pelvic fins, sending additional thrills of energy across her twitching and quivering body. Bonnie grabbed Mac’s face and kissed him deeply, thrusting her tongue into his mouth, instinctively curling the ends of her flukes around his tail to bring her hips into his.

“Uh, uh,” Mac said playfully. “Not yet,” he teased her, keeping her hips back but rotating them in smaller and smaller circles, keeping the head of his cock outside her vent.

As her need grew, Bonnie’s breasts filled with pressure. She pulled herself to Mac again, this time forcing the head of his penis into her canal before Mac could stop her. She growled and arched her hips towards him, forcing another inch inside her. The stretching felt wonderful and she wanted more, deeper, NOW.

But Mac was too strong. He kept her at bay, and started rotating her hips again. She cried out in frustration, but he silenced her with another kiss. She hungrily kissed him back, still struggling to force more of his cock inside her. She felt another inch slip in, and then she felt a tightness, a hitch in her canal. Her virginity. She really was a virgin!

Mac pulled his head back and looked down at their union. One either side of them, the two mermaids were leaking milk into the water, each building towards their own orgasms. Bonnie looked down as well, feeling three inches of mer cock inside her and seeing another seven or eight inches left to go. Her insides quivered at the thought of all of that moving into her.

“Ready?” He asked, his eyes full of love and gentleness mixed with need and lust. Bonnie nodded, as her face was a mask of lust too.

Mac kept his hands on her hips and drew himself nearly out of her vent, then paused, their eyes locked. He waited a brief second and then pulled her hips forcefully, slamming into her with a thwack. All three mermaids vocalized in unison. Bonnie barked in pain, which quickly dissolved into passionate moans while Annette and Joy grunted as Mac’s fins vibrated sharply in their vents. Mac pulled out slowly and slammed back in, Bonnie moaning deep in her throat, feeling every inch as it slipped out and then slammed back into her. Mac’s rhythm increased steadily until her breasts let down and milk began pouring from her nipples. Bonnie vocalized constantly and could both see and sense the bioluminescence race across all four of them. Bonnie never felt anything so consuming and passionate in her life. Joy erupted first, grunting out her orgasm, jerking with each individual spasm. Annette was next, her orgasm rolling over her in continuous waves, her body quivering like a tuning fork.

“Yesssssss,” Mac groaned as he gushed into Bonnie, feeling each pulse racing up his penis and unleashing itself within her new vagina.

Mac’s first hot splash deep inside her body surprised Bonnie. A mermaid could feel something that deep inside her! Then her own orgasm erupted, her body going rigid as Mac stroked in and out a few more times, sending pulses of semen into her tight, tense body. On his third stroke, an enormous spike of pleasure turned her body into jelly, and she collapsed onto Mac, her womb throbbing and thumping as the rest of her flailed limply. Mac pressed his body to hers, and her throbbing vent squeezed out one more pulse from his cock.

It took many minutes before Bonnie could recover, and when she did, she discovered herself still impaled on a rigid and ready merman’s cock.

“My turn, my dear,” Annette said, pushing gently at Bonnie’s hips, causing Mac to slip out of her vent.

“Yes, my love,” Bonnie said, barely able to move of her own accord.

Jack divided his time between the video feeds from his computer and the amazing sight of the transformation of the two mermaids. A few minutes after the transformation began, he watched the helicopters hover and disgorge a group of commandos, and swarm over his island, little blobs of green pulsating on his computer screen. They surrounded the house and outbuildings while one of the two boats pulled up to the northeast side of the island where another group of commandos jumped from the boat into the bay. They scrambled up the grassy shoreline a few moments later and fanned out, forming a perimeter along that side of the island. At the same time, the other boat pulled alongside The Slipper and vomited more commandos who swarmed up the dock, fanning out to form a similar perimeter on the other side of the island and surrounding anyone in the house or outbuildings, cutting them off from any escape.

Unless they could swim out a tunnel, of course.

The audio and video feeds hidden around his island tracked the progress of the raid. Kyle walked outside as soon as the troops dropped from the sky and immediately lay down on the ground, his hands outstretched over his head. Three men grabbed him quickly and cuffed, frisked, and then hustled him down to the boat at the dock. Jack had no idea what they were saying, but he hoped that Kyle was doing fine. More than that, he hoped Kyle shredded most of their notes from the last two days. He didn’t want any of their potential recruits to get sucked into this mess.

In the meantime, the black-clad commandos continued to swarm over the entire island and into every room of his house. The basement passway to his hidden, underground tank remained undiscovered, but Jack knew that wouldn’t last forever. The helicopters flew away, presumably returning to whence they had come, probably Quantico, Jack thought. The men then began a more thorough and methodical search of the island, the outbuildings, his house, and its furnishings and effects.

He cringed when he saw his computers and other equipment, including the short wave radio with the dial still set to its last frequency, hauled out to the military boats. Two more boats arrived while the search continued. One was a similar looking military boat while the other looked like a civilian yacht, but Jack knew better.

After a short while, the three military boats took on all of the commandos and departed, presumably with Kyle still aboard. Seven men left the yacht, all of them in overcoats and carrying black cases of various shapes and sizes. Jack smiled, the screen on his computer looking very much like a bad action movie. Sometimes the spooks acted exactly as Hollywood expected. The men marched up to the house and began unpacking their equipment.

Jack opened yet another screen on his computer, got past his own security, and then initiated a series of protocols making most of their electronic gadgetry useless, overwhelmed by countless sources of electronic emissions, 90% of them bogus, buried in nearly every nook and cranny of the house and island. There was a slight hitch in the lights in the tank viewing room as the protocol initiated, but so slight that the men in his house did not see it.

As night gave way to morning, the men above kept up with their fruitless scans of the island. They knew something was here, but with so many of their devices overwhelmed by so many false sources, they had resorted to old-fashioned searching. They went from room-to-room, tapping and knocking on walls, floors, and furniture. Jackson wished he had installed some sort of active defense on his island, sleeping gas or something.

However, his interest and attention was mostly on the tank, watching the two newest mers blossom within the veil of bubbles roiling around them. As dawn approached, the two new mers winked out of view. They then provided the most spectacular, and erotic, light show Jack had ever seen. A light show repeated, with changing partners, three times. It was nearly 9 AM in the morning before the mers snapped back into view, their heads and hands lined along the top of the glass wall of the tank.

“Got any food?” Mac asked.

Jack nodded and went into the storeroom, returning with a case of MRE’s.

“Perfect,” Mac said. “I love military food.”

“I hate military food,” Bonnie said, taking one of the packages anyway.

“What’s with the ceiling?” Joy asked as she ripped open the mylar bag of her MRE.

“We have visitors,” Jack said. “They took Kyle, all my computers, the radio, everything.”

“A family matter?” Asked Annette her new voice silvery and shimmering like Joy’s voice.

“Unusual for the Company to act against a domestic target,” Jack said. “I can’t be sure, but it has a military feel to it.”

“With your estate donated to the MMI, might that make you a non-domestic target?” Annette asked.

“No,” Jack answered. “The MMI is legally based out of San Francisco, which despite what some conservatives think, is still part of the US.”

“What’s the status?” Mac asked, looking up at the thick slab above their heads.

“We are sealed in, for the moment,” Jack said, walking over to the wall console. “There are seven men topside. I’ve rendered their electronic surveillance and search devices useless. They are currently moving room-to-room searching by hand.”

“Estimate?” Mac asked.

“Later today or tonight, maybe,” Jack said. “If they find the passageway, they won’t gain access. It would take a bunker bomb to open this place up, and they can’t risk one of those in the middle of the Chesapeake.”

“Recommendations?” Mac asked.

“We wait,” Jack said. “I’ve asked some friends for help, including Mr. Kolbert, which I hope was adequate warning to him that the game’s afoot.”

“I hate waiting more than Bonnie hates military food,” Joy said, watching her new sister-wife grimace as she choked down her food.

“He says he won’t eat,” Bridget reported. “I suppose this is his way of taking control of the situation.”

“How long will he stay alive if he is successful?” Pat asked.

“Depends on how much water he drinks,” Bridget said, drawing on her pod’s medical knowledge gained thanks to mer bonding. “Without water, in this heat, he wouldn’t last more than three or four days. With water and without food, I’d say about four or five weeks. But I don’t think he can do it. He seemed unable to resist food and water on the boat.”

“Well, we can force him to drink water,” Pat observed. “So that Valencia’s wishes that Malaki should be witness to her transformation can be fulfilled.”

“Yes, that’s easy, even without fancy medical equipment,” Bridget said. She turned towards Malaki’s hut, took a few tentative salamander steps in that direction and then looked back over her shoulder. “You know, he really is a nasty little man.”

“I know,” Pat said.

“I probably wouldn’t have said this a year ago, but we really are doing the right thing,” Bridget said.

“Thanks, sis,” Pat said, moved. “That means a lot to me, actually.”

Pat watched her sister salamander out of the shallow water, back up the beach, and into the small hut where Malaki was a prisoner. A moment after she entered, a colorful and creative stream of swear words and curses competed with the sounds of the gentle surf in which Pat rested. The sound of someone gagging on water choked off a particularly loud curse, followed by more coughing, then by more curses, then followed again shortly with another fit of gagging and coughing, and so on.

Pat smiled and shook her head at the man’s stubbornness. She looked down the beach towards the southern arm of the lagoon where MuSu’s pod lay gathered around Emma senior and the Basras. Pat saw Emma explaining something to her mother, perhaps the mechanics of mer transformations and changing genders. Pat’s heart fluttered a bit as she remembered the separation she and Danni endured to get Gabriel’s pod started. Ah, Michael, she thought, he was a good man, but now Gabriel was an excellent leader to his pod. Three tiny mermaid tails fluttering across her own as her pod’s daughters swam over and around her tail interrupted her musings.

“Come here, you!” she cried as she reached for Maureen.

Her daughter wriggled away from her grasp, and Pat’s mer organs sensed the giggles erupting from the tiny mermaid. Freya popped up out of the water and flipped onto Pat’s lap. She looked up at Pat with toddler eyes, shining with mischief and excitement, her Shirley Temple curls bouncing around her angelic face. She made a face at her aunt, and then flipped back into the water to chase her sisters. Pat felt a tug on her fluke fringes and scooped up little Cynthia who was trying to tickle her pod-mother.

“What have we said about pulling on fringes?” Pat asked with a playful but serious tone.

Cynthia, now cradled in the bowl created by Pat’s curled flukes, made a play to pull on Pat’s fringes again.

“Uh, uhhh, no pulling,” Pat said, flipping the little mermaid up into the air and back into the water.

The little mermaid squealed with delight as she splashed back into the surf. Pat couldn’t help laughing at the little squirmer’s antics. A second later, Phoebe, Danni, and John surfaced just beyond the breakers. All three little mermaids made a beeline for their father.

“I feel someone tickling me,” John said. “I wonder who it could be?”

“Three guesses,” Pat said, admiring her handsome mate.

“Here, give this to the babysitter,” John said, handing a bag of collected food to Phoebe. He smiled and then ducked under the water to play with his children.

Phoebe and Danni glided up to Pat and then flipped over and sat on either side of her, the three mermaids all facing the sea. Phoebe handed Pat the bag having an assortment of oysters, sea grasses, and one small bonefish.

“We’ve already eaten,” Phoebe said. “You enjoy.”

“Thanks,” she said, opening the bag and nevertheless sharing a few of the oysters.

The three ate in silence, listening to the wind, surf, and the occasional coughing fits from Malaki. The early morning sun sparkled and danced on the lagoon’s gentle waves, a calm occasionally broken by the eruption of a tiny mermaid arcing across the surface, trying to avoid her father’s tickling. The three mermaid mothers finished eating and unconsciously assumed the same position, their arms behind their torsos, their tails stretching into the shallow surf, their long hair cascading down their back, the long ends floating hydrophobically on the surface, their tiaras flashing in the morning sun, while the surf sparkled and danced gently all around them.

“Does it bother you that we have to constantly forage for our food?” Danni asked.

“No,” Pat said.

“Don’t you miss tables, knives and forks, cooked food, and waiters?” she persisted.

Pat thought for a moment. “Sometimes, but fresh food is really good, and there’s something honest about catching it yourself.”

“Or having your pod-mate catch it for you,” Phoebe said.

“Will we ever farm the ocean?” Danni asked.

“Eventually,” Pat said.

“Really?” Danni asked.

“There’s going to be nine or ten billion people on the planet pretty soon, and unless we develop a sustainable way to farm and trade with the landlubbers, we mers are going to be in trouble,” Pat said.

“I don’t want to be a farmer,” Danni said.

“No one will make you be a farmer,” Pat said, smiling.

“I’m just saying,” Danni said, pulling a lock of her hair forward and twirling it in her fingers. “I won’t be a farmer.”

“I think we can find people who do,” Pat laughed. “What do you want to do?”

“Love you guys,” Danni answered. “It’s a lot of work to love a couple of scientists. You work late, leave me with the kids a lot, and then there’s John to keep happy.”

“So, where exactly is the hard work part,” Pat asked. “Oh, nevermind,” she said seeing Danni’s smirk. She turned to Phoebe. “When do you think Alexis and Galina will be done testing the samples that Harold collected from the hot tub this morning?”

“Probably not too much longer,” Phoebe answered. “While we wait, why don’t we join John and the children?”

Pat tossed the empty collection bag on the sand behind her and then doubled forward and sprang into the waves.

“I’ll take that as a yes,” Phoebe said as she swung her tail behind her and wriggled herself into deeper water, Danni right behind her. Soon, the entire family was cavorting in the sparkling waters of the lagoon.

Bart Kolbert rubbed his chin as he read the email from Jackson Baker, his eyes narrowing as he read the message. He pushed himself back from his desk, laced his fingers behind his head, craned his head back to look at his favorite thinking spot on the ceiling, and let out a loud sigh. For a man he had known only a few days, Mr. Baker was making his life far more interesting than was desirable.

“What’s up boss?” his secretary asked from the next room.

“In a minute, Lucia,” he said, keeping his attention fixed to the ceiling. He glanced back towards the laptop on his desk, confirming that the email was, in fact, real, and yes, he had read it correctly. He returned to his study of the ceiling. After a few moments, he closed his eyes.

“We’re going to need to make some calls,” he said loud enough for Lucia to hear him. “We have a problem.”

“Don’t we always have a problem,” she responded, walking into the room.

Lucia Washington was a short, energetic, young woman with dark, flashing eyes and a toothy smile. Her mixed African-Anglo-Mexican heritage was visible in her generous lips and short, curly dark hair, which hung in ringlets about her face. She was working her way through college, taking night classes at the local community college, and Bart hoped she would one day achieve her dream of going to law school.

“That’s why people get lawyers,” she said.

“What’s the status of that special order we put together the other day?” he asked.

Lucia took out her smart phone and opened an app. When it launched, she entered an authorization code and then waited. She looked up at Bart. “It shipped today. Is that the problem? We sort of fudged the dates on the bill of lading for that.”

“Nah … it might be, but I don’t think so,” he said. “It’s going out by air right now and then by ship?”

“Yes, should be in Tuvalu in a few hours, and man, that cost us some serious cash,” she said.

She looked back down at her app. “An agent will pick it up at Funafuti International Airport and then take it to the MMI by tramp cargo. It should get there late today or early tomorrow, depending on weather.”

“It’s tomorrow there already,” he said.

“Oh, yea,” she said. “I forgot. Well, it should be there in 6 to 10 hours from now; will that work for you?”

“Lucia, how long have you worked for me?” Bart asked, sitting up and facing her.

“Three years,” she answered.

“You know about our confidentiality requirements, of course,” he said.

“Yes, of course,” she answered.

“Yes, you do,” he said, rubbing his chin again. “You’ve been one of my best executive assistants, if not the best one I’ve ever had.”

“Thank you, sir. I do my best,” she answered, sitting slowly in the chair facing him across the desk. “This sounds like a very big problem.”

“Yes,” he sighed. “I might be brought in for questioning.”

“Oh, no!” she said, straightening up. “That shipment wasn’t illegal, was it?”

“No, it wasn’t. But I won’t be brought in because of something I’ve done that’s illegal,” he reassured her. “I’m pretty sure that I’m not personally in trouble. However, the work that we’ve been doing on the Marine Mammals Institute has hit the radar of some of the security agencies for the Federal Government.”

“Why would Homeland Security care about dolphins?” Lucia said.

“Actually, they have no idea what they are dealing with, and neither do you. It’s time I told you the truth about the MMI,” he said. “When I’m done, you will tell no one except the people whom I authorize to discuss these details, and if I am taken in for questioning, you will contact these people immediately. Do you understand?”

“Yes, sir,” she answered. “What is the problem with MMI?”

“How do you feel about mermaids?” he asked.

“Mermaids, sir?” she asked.

“Mermaids, yes,” he said. “You know, stuff like this,” he pulled out a copy of News of The World from his desk.

The supermarket tabloid showed lurid pictures of pop stars on the beach or drunkenly leaving clubs and claims of alien abduction. In the bottom right hand corner was the headline, “Mermaids kidnap prostitutes!” There was a picture of an elderly Filipino woman pointing towards a commercial looking house with a dock out the back.

“Mermaid and alien abductions! Yeah, right. Where, exactly, are you going with this, sir?” she asked, looking at him as though he had suddenly sprouted a second head.

“What if I told you that mermaids were the marine mammals that the institute was actually for?” he asked.

“Are you crazy?” she asked. “I mean, that’s crazy. Mermaids. Shit, mermaids. Wait … you’re serious, aren’t you?”

“Very,” he said, folding his hands on his desk. “Real, live, honest-toGod -mermaids. In fact, although few people know it, this story is actually true, but they didn’t kidnap the prostitutes, they rescued them.”

He pushed the tabloid across his desk to his stunned assistant. She looked at the picture and then the text next to it, and then back at him.

“Fuck!” she said softly. “Shit, oops, sorry. I mean … seriously? Mermaids?”

“Like a heart attack,” he answered.

She looked at him for several seconds, searching for the clue that he was kidding. “No kidding, for-real mermaids?”

“For real,” he said.

She looked at the tabloid, and then back at him.

“You mean some of this stuff is true?” she asked. “Like, Men In Black was for real?”

“Alien stories, as far as I know, aren’t real, but this one is, though no one seems to believe that poor, old woman,” he answered.

“Holy shit,” she said, reading the short article. “They attacked people?” she asked.

“Bad guys only,” Bart answered. “I actually know some of them; or rather I used to know them before they were mermaids.”

“You mean they weren’t always mermaids?” she asked.

“Yes, they were people just like you and me. They’ve discovered a way to become mermaids and mermen,” he answered.

Lucia’s jaw literally dropped to her chest. Bart had to stifle a grin. He waited.

“They BECAME mermaids?” she asked.

“Yes, it’s a long story, and not important to what we have to do now,” Bart said. “I’ll explain it all later.”

“You’d better,” she said, trying to gather her wits together. She sat up, struck with a thought.

“Then why are you their lawyer?” She asked. “I mean, you can’t swim and you hate the water.”

“That makes me perfect, because I will never be tempted to join them,” he explained.

“Oh, that makes sense, I guess,” she said. She put her chin in her hands again, drumming her fingers along her lower lip. She sat up again.

“This is gonna be a shitstorm, isn’t it?” she said, her eyes wide. “A for-real shitstorm of media, black helicopters, and crazy shit.”

“Exactly,” Bart said.

“Sorry about the swearing, boss. You just rocked my world,” Lucia said.

“Don’t worry about it. Hell, I may even let one or two slide out, myself,” he said with a small laugh. “So, here’s what I need you to do … “

“Well, it is not possible to be sure,” said Galina, looking around at the assembled mer community gathered on the beach in the midday sun. “This is science, right. We need to test on a live subject to be more certain.”

“And we’re ready for testing?” Danni asked.

Pat nodded, “Yes, the colonization of the hot tub is stable, with the microorganisms staying dormant until they’re triggered by the enhanced superoxide radicals that type II siren cells excrete as metabolic waste. We’ve confirmed that it’s the presence of the ESRs that trigger the cascade of the micros and siren cells into a transformative critical mass.”

“If only we could stop the siren cells at that stage, we could solve a lot of problems for the transgendered community,” Debra said, smiling at Trixi.

“Nah,” Trixi said. “Being a mermaid is much better than being a meremaid. ”

“What’s a type II siren cell?” Peter, the retired chemist, asked. “Are they different cells or do they change roles over time?”

“They change based on environmental conditions, we think,” Pat answered. “The siren cells function like a stem cell, and so depending on epigenetic or environmental influences, they can become nearly anything. Type I siren cells do cellular repair, which is why we fully restore our health. We don’t actually become younger, as our cells are merely repaired so that they function at optimal levels once again.”

“Cells are merely repaired,” Peter said. “That’s an incredible understatement.”

“Probably,” Pat agreed. “Type I Siren cells are nothing compared to Type IIs, however, which are triggered when hormonal shifts in the subject dramatically raises or lowers the levels of prolactin.”

“Isn’t that one of the hormones that associated lactation?” Peter asked.

“Yes,” Phoebe answered, jumping in. “This is one reason why mermaids constantly lactate; we have higher levels of prolactin than normal females. But prolactin is in both sexes, and it is the hormone that also reinforces relaxation and submission.”

“So, it’s not the merman semen that triggers the change?” Sandi asked. “I thought you told us it was; or was it that it would make the change go faster?”

“We thought so too, originally,” Pat admitted. “But we’ve discovered that the trigger is internal to the changing body, not external to the source of siren cells, which is actually just like the original painted shellfish from which the original goop was created. God, that seems like a lifetime ago, now.”

“Seems like only yesterday to me, my dear,” John said.

“So, there’s no difference between siren cells found in mermaid milk and merman semen?” Peter asked.

“Not any functional difference,” Phoebe said. “Remember that the siren cell’s baseline is a female configuration, which is why all our children are female, just like those fish. When prolactin levels spike or dip, that’s what triggers the change in sex.”

“So,” Peter said, putting his chin in his hand in the classic ‘thinking’ pose. “A high level of prolactin would trigger a reinforcement of--or a return to--the female baseline. Therefore, an act of submission or retreat big enough would trigger a male to female transition in an otherwise normal human male.”

“Exactly,” Pat said. “And since humans culturally construct oral sex with men as submissive, the subsequent spike in prolactin triggers further change.”

“So what about the reverse, female to male?” Gabriel asked. “What happened to me?”

“Prolactin levels drop dramatically when you’re feeling aggressive or powerful, and testosterone, also present in both sexes, spikes,” Phoebe said. “Mers can probably go between sexes more or less like a toggle switch, but the switch to male only happens when there are enough siren cells present, and a huge shift in prolactin levels occurs.”

“Enough?” Peter asked.

“Low levels of siren cells tend to be limited to Type I activities,” Pat answered. “Change to or reinforcement of the baseline doesn’t seem to take many siren cells, it just takes time. A little dab will do ya.”

After an awkward pause, Phoebe said, “I told you no one would get that.”

“Anyway,” Pat continued. “Major changes, like female to male and human to mer, require an abundance of siren cells. However, once a siren cell is present, you will someday be a mer, and probably a mermaid.”

“So, if there are lots of siren cells, but no change in prolactin, what happens to a man?” Peter asked.

“That’s one of the things we want to find out,” Pat said.

“We believe that more siren cells cause a faster Type I effect, but no other change,” Galina said.

“And what about the tail colors, shapes, sizes, what changes all that?” Gabriel asked.

“Oh, those are the epigenetic effects of our mer organs,” Phoebe says.

“Which means you still don’t know,” Gabriel said. “That much I know from my lovely Galina.”

“Yes,” Pat admitted. “We still don’t know.”

“And and Type III siren cells the ones that achieve the ultimate transformation into mers?” Peter asked. “What triggers that change?”

“Yes, Type III’s are the ones that take us from human to mer,” Pat said. “We’re still nailing down the particulars, and we learn more with each transition. The major factor, we believe, is a superabundance of siren cells; that’s why we must feed before we can transition into mers, whereas changes in age and to the female sex are more or less inevitable, once a single siren cell is introduced.”

“But all this is hypothesis, right?” Peter asked.

“Pretty good hypothesis,” Galina said haughtily.

“But we still need confirmation under controlled conditions,” Pat agreed.

“And that is where we come in,” Peter said, waving his hand over the humans who were sprinkled among the mers. “We’re going to be your test subjects.”

“If you’re willing,” Pat said.

“I’m willing,” Valencia said.

Bill Tatnall, Assistant Director of the Electronic Surveillance and Intelligence Command Center of the Central Intelligence Agency stood stiffly at attention in the office of his boss. He only had two more years until retirement, and he was counting the days already.

To a casual observer, Bill Tatnall looked like computer nerd, an old computer nerd, but a nerd nevertheless. His clothes looked like they’d been slept in and his hair hadn’t seen a comb in several days. He was a big man and unused to standing for very long. Between the unexpected physical work he was doing and the stress of being called before his boss, he was sweating like a whore in church. Behind him were at least half a dozen other officers and agents who were equally nerdy and equally uncomfortable.

Susan Perelli, a petite woman with severe, though attractive, features, tapped a pencil on her desk, gazed at Agent Tatnall over her vintage cat-style reading glasses, watching him shift uncomfortably before her. Other than the flinty glint in her eyes, one might easily mistake her for a timid librarian.

“Didn’t anyone think to simply call?” she asked rhetorically. “This is an intelligence agency, after all. Doesn’t anyone gather intelligence anymore?”

“It wasn’t our raid,” Bill said, almost apologetically. “I don’t know how we missed it, though. In retrospect the electronic chatter was pretty thick.”

“Not good enough, Bill. I’ve got my boss demanding answers yesterday,” she said, irritated. “The stupid idiots over at NSA or the Pentagon, I can never tell who does what these days, have a politically problematic prisoner who apparently doesn’t know anything. But no one over there will return any of my calls, and my own elite team has no idea how a military raid on one of our own operatives in his own civilian residence--a civilian who is now missing, I might add--could have happened under our noses.”

Bill shifted his weight again as his boss put her face in hands, resting her elbows on her desk. She thought for a few minutes and then raised her head.

“First priority is to get those goddamn NSA fucks off Taylor’s Island,” she said. “When you and I were there a few years ago, didn’t Jackson mention something about being able to survive nearly any physical or electronic attack? I’ll bet that Mr. Baker will reappear once they leave him alone. I mean, he’s one of ours, for fuck’s sake. Why didn’t they just call us?”

“Tribes,” Bill said, sensing a break in the tension, running his fingers through his greasy hair. “Fucking tribes.”

“I’ll get started on tracking down the chain of command and try to get the cowboy who authorized this raid to back down,” Susan said, grabbing her phone. “I want the rest of you to figure out what we missed that would have told us an operation on this scale was happening in our own backyard.”

Everyone heard the command in her voice and began to leave.

“Bill,” she said, halting his exit. “Find out everything you can about who has the prisoner and why, see if we can’t find a way to pry him loose.”

“It’s that friend of Jack’s, right?” Bill asked. “The guy with the boat?”

“Yes, that’s him,” Susan said. “I wish I had remembered that earlier. Mr. Kyle Johnson of Hopkins, Virginia. Maybe he’s a vet or something. Let’s embarrass the shit out of those idiots.”

“You got it boss,” Bill said, turning to leave the office.

Susan watched him retreat to his cubicle. She often felt like a mother hen to her brood of misfits and hackers, constantly tending to their quirky needs, hurts, and slights, all the while herding them back to the task of making the world safe for democracy. Someone had attacked one of her brood, and she wasn’t going to put up with that. She dialed the phone.

“The Office of the President, please,” she said. “I’d like to speak to Miriam Danders, please.”

Sometimes the best way to find something out was to call up an old friend. Of course, it helped if your old friend was secretary to the chief of staff for the President of the United States.

“You’ve never even had a speeding ticket?” the Navy JAG officer asked, increasingly frustrated with the taciturn old man across the table from him.

“Ah, nope,” Kyle Johnson answered, secretly enjoying the obvious stress the young man was under.

“And you have no idea why Mr. Jackson Baker’s property was raided by … um … our security forces?” the young man asked, flipping nervously through the too thin file folder in his hands.

“Nope,” he answered.

“Is there any other information you can share? Sir, you’ve known Mr. Baker for nearly 50 years. Surely you can provide me with some information that will help us settle these issues,” Officer Eldridge Jones said.

“Known him for 58 years, since we was both five years old,” answered Kyle.

“Fifty-eight,” Jones wrote on the otherwise blank page in his notebook.

The young officer shook his head, amazed he had gotten any information from his prisoner. Deciding on a new tack, he straightened up, and looked Kyle in the eye.

“Do you have any questions for me?” he asked.

“Ah, nope,” Kyle answered.

“Nothing?” Officer Jones asked again. “You haven’t asked any one of the people who have questioned you why you were brought here or what’s going on. Why not?”

“Would me knowing change anything?” Kyle asked with a wry smile.

Jones furrowed his brow, trying to formulate an answer. There was a knock at the door, and Jones put down his pencil, rose and walked to the door, opening it a crack.

“A word, Lieutenant?” a feminine, though authoritative voice asked from the hallway.

The young JAG officer straightened to attention, walked back to the table, put the file, his notebook, and his pencil in a slim attaché case, and then walked back out into the hallway, closing the door behind him. Kyle remained motionless in his chair, as he had for the past eighteen hours since his arrival at this navy brig. After five minutes of silence, another officer walked into the interrogation room in which Kyle had spent most of his day.

“Mr. Johnson?” he asked rhetorically.

“Ah, yup,” Kyle answered, looking up.

“I’m Captain David Pomo,” he said, extending a hand. Kyle rose and shook it. “I’m sure you have lots of questions, but I’d like you to come with me. It seems that there has been a serious breach of national security which has caused this unfortunate incident to occur.”

“Shit happens,” Kyle said laconically.

The captain looked at his charge humorously, reappraising him.

“Yes, sir. All the time,” he agreed. “We have some necessary paperwork to fill out, and I am afraid that I’ll have to ask you to sign a confidentiality agreement before I can release you.”

“You want me not to talk about it?” Kyle asked.

“Yes, sir,” he answered, opening the door to usher him out.

“Don’t like talking much anyway,” Kyle said as he walked out the door.

“Yes, sir. We’ve noticed,” the officer said, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips.

Michael Thompson stood on the forward deck of The Johanna, watching the retreating tramp merchant ship disappear to the north. He glanced back at Peter and Leonard and watched as they secured the lines and nets that Wong and Tuo’s pods ran around the forty-foot container floating off the stern. The massive, rust red box was nearly as long as The Johanna, but only the top few inches of the shipping box appeared above the surface of the waves.

“Do you think they bought our story?” Liz asked, watching the ship as it grew smaller and smaller.

“No. They probably think we’re drug smugglers or something,” Michael said. “It was a Somali ship, and so they probably deliver questionable things all over the globe. I’m sure they think we’re doing something illegal.”

“Will that be a problem?” Liz persisted.

“Let’s hope not,” Michael said, watching as the mers made a final loop around the box. “Jaclyn’s lawyer was supposed to take care of everything.”

“Mr. Kolbert,” Liz nodded. “He was very good at settling up my assets. I’m sure we’ll be fine.”

“Let’s hope so,” Michael agreed.

“All set!” Tuo shouted. Peter and Len both gave him a thumbs up.

“Inflate the bladders,” Michael shouted back to the mers. The colorful pods both disappeared under the waves, and a few seconds later, the massive container rose in the water, supported by inflated air bladders secured by a web of nets and ropes. When the box was nearly halfway out of the water, and drafting nearly the same two meters as The Johanna, Michael shouted, “Alright Liz, all ahead by half.”

The engines throbbed, the ropes snapping and creaking as The Johanna pulled the massive container back into the lagoon, which was too shallow for the cargo ship. Michael watched Liz gently guiding both the yacht and the container through the shallow gap in the reef into the pristine lagoon they were now calling home. Peter and Len cast off the ropes as Liz swung the boat back out towards the sea. From behind the container, the water roiled madly as the mers pushed the container from behind like a massive, organic, outboard motor. The box grounded slowly onto the sand of the beach, about ten meters away from the high water mark in the sand.

“I hope they packed everything in watertight containers ,” Len said. “Otherwise we’re about to ruin a bunch of electronic equipment.”

“Yea, it’s too bad we don’t have a crane or something,” Peter said.

“I hope this place never gets a crane,” Tuo said, his breath coming in great gasps while recovering from the effort of trying to push the box further up onto the beach. “Mer power is all that we’ll ever need.”

“I wish I could agree with you,” Pat said, surfacing next to him. “We’ll probably need all kinds of power if we are to survive the next few months.”

“I just don’t think we should have a crane,” Tuo said. “It would ruin the lagoon.”

“Don’t worry, my fine merman,” Pat said, waving Galina, Alexis, and Phoebe forward to start supervising the unloading of the goodies sent by Bart Kolbert to the MMI. “We’ll never put a crane on this island.”

“Alexis, don’t carry anything heavy, you hear me?” Pat said watching the beautiful pink and white mermaid dash into the now open container, with water sloshing about inside the box.

“I’m not due for six more months,” Alexis’ voice echoed from within the container. “I’ll be fine.”

“Where’s Eric when I need him,” Pat asked rhetorically.

“Over here,” he said, surfacing along with Sally right next to the container. Sally had her eyes fixed on Alexis and her work inside the container.

“There are just too many mers in the lagoon to keep you all straight,” Pat complained. “Will you please keep an eye on your mate?”

“I’ll keep an eye on her, because she’s beautiful,” Eric said. “But I might as well order the moon to alter its orbit rather than try to get Alexis to change her mind once she’s made it up.”

“Not helping,” Pat said with good humor.

“Don’t worry,” Eric said. “I’ll keep her safe and healthy, but nothing will slow her down. Alexis knows how desperate Sally is to learn what’s happening to her father.”

“I know,” Pat said. “Me too.”

“That’s why we’ll have the new and improved satellite up-link working in no time!” Eric said before he ducked inside to join Alexis.

Petra, Xing, and Gabriel sat in the surf on the north side of the lagoon, watching the commotion surrounding the unloading of the container. Nearby, Danni and John watched over their three children who were playing with Michelle and Bao, and Liga who was nursing Mari. Petra watched as her tall, scientifically inclined pod-mate glanced over a plastic covered paper in one hand while pointing to the mixed assemblage of mers and humans who sorted through those items slated for the caves and those staying topside.

Petra felt a twinge of guilt watching Galina working with all the others, so many mers and humans toiling together to drag tightly sealed cases up the beach or back out into the surf all strung together in a long chain. She caught Gabriel giving her a long look from where he lay with his tail in the water, his upper torso on the wet sand.

“I saw that,” he said. “You’re just as important to all of us as Galina, so don’t start feeling guilty that you’re over here with the kids.”

“Sometimes, mer senses are just too sensitive,” Petra complained. “I can’t keep anything to myself anymore.”

“Not me,” Gabriel said. “I wouldn’t trade feeling your love the way that I can for all the privacy in the world.”

“You always know exactly the right thing to say,” Petra said, feeling that special love rising throughout her body. “I love you.”

“I love you too,” he said as he lay back on the sand, stretching his three-meter long body. “I’m not feeling guilty. Someone has to be over here to protect everyone.”

“Don’t work too hard,” Petra teased, flipping a bit of sand at him with her pelvic fin.

“Gotta keep myself ready, energy in reserve,” Gabriel continued, closing his eyes, surveying the lagoon with his mer senses.

“How long do you think they’ll be gone?” Liga asked as she switched her daughter from one breast to the other. Liga’s pod-mates--Eric, Sally, and Alexis--were already halfway up the mountain, along with Peter, getting ready to install the newer and more powerful, solar powered satellite dish and up-link near the top of their extinct volcano.

“The last time anyone was up there, other than Harold, was about four months ago when Trevor and Rose helped Alexis and Galina set up the gun controls,” Petra said.

“She was still Robbie back then,” Liga said. “Has it really been that long since a mer went up the mountain?”

“It’s a long way to salamander,” Petra said. “I only remember Galina going up there once, but she was fine. It did take all day, though. Don’t worry, Eric and Sally know what they’re doing, and Alexis … “

“Is Alexis,” Liga finished. “She is so stubborn.”

“She’ll be fine,” Petra said. “I didn’t slow down until my ninth month, and then only just a little. She’s not even showing yet, and so she will be fine.”

“I just worry,” Liga said.

“You’re a mother; it’s required,” Petra said with a smile.

“Yes,” Liga said, looking down at her tiny daughter. “I am.”

“I wish I had thought of that,” Jack said, watching another camera go off line. The seven men searching the house and island for clues as to Jack’s whereabouts were putting electrical tape over camera lenses as they discovered them. They were intent on depriving him of information. Fortunately, for Jack, they only discovered about half of the tiny devices embedded in rocks, trees, bricks, walls, floors, and ceilings. Nevertheless, they would win that battle with enough time. “Well, eventually we’ll be blind,” he reported, turning towards the mers who were lying together in a erotic heap the middle of the floor. “Can someone give me a break? I gotta go.”

“I’ll watch,” Bonnie said, extracting herself from her pod mates. She salamandered over to the wall console and pulled herself up onto the stool that Jackson had put there for the mers to perch. Once she was sitting, she curled her tail around the base of the bar stool and turned her attention to the screen. Jackson went into the storage room where an emergency commode sat in one corner. After a moment, he returned to the viewing room.

“They still haven’t figured out the basement yet,” Annette said encouragingly. “Maybe they won’t?”

Jack shrugged.

“Maybe we should sabotage their boat,” Mac said.

“No, that would only bring an intensified response,” Joy said. “As much as I hate waiting, I would hate to see a return of those soldiers. They would tear this place apart until nothing was left.”

“Hey, something is happening,” Bonnie said, pointing to the screen.

Jack walked over to the computer, looking over Bonnie’s shoulder, noting how her thick hair was now dry and smelling of salt-water and flowers. He was tempted to caress her shoulder and hair, but instead forced his eyes to the computer screen. Although they had lost visuals on about half the house, he could see that the activity had changed from searching to packing.

“They look like they are packing things up to leave,” Bonnie said.

“They won’t leave completely,” Jack said. “Either they will leave someone or a monitoring device.”

“More likely both,” Annette said. “If they do leave, how secure can you make the island?”

“I can find anything that is giving off a signal not one of my own,” Jack said. “But finding it and disabling it will tell them we’re here.”

“They are going back to their boat,” Bonnie answered. “But I only count six men. I can’t see where the seventh man might be.”

“I really wish I had a weapon handy,” Jack said. “All that’s down here are spear guns, which don’t really work well out of the water.”

“We’ve got weapons,” Mac said, twisting his tail up, exposing his barb to Jackson. “Of course, it’s really only good close up, in hand-to-fin combat.”

“Hand to fin,” Jack smiled. “I like that.”

“The seventh man just got onto the boat,” Bonnie reported. “They are all leaving.”

“Well, Jack … it’s your island,” Annette said. “What do you want to do?”

“Wait,” he answered.

“I know,” said Annette turning to Joy, “you hate waiting.” She blew her new sister wife a kiss, which mollified Joy a bit.

“Alright Bonnie, my turn back at the computer,” Jack said. “While we wait, I’ll try to figure out if any of my calls for help are the reason why our guests have left.”

Valencia watched Harold and Michael drag her father from his hut and brought over to where she stood. Even now, nearly a full day later, she couldn’t believe what was happening to her life. Her life, she thought. Amazing. Although she was still a young man, she now easily thought of herself as a female. Incredible.

She thought about the progression she’d undergone. Only a few days ago, “his” only thoughts had been to kill “his” father and take as much money as possible to run away, hide somewhere and try to rebuild “his” life anew. But the mers had changed all that! She could rebuild “his” life completely and in a way that would cause his father humiliation and anguish. To become a girl, and then a mermaid!

At first, the idea grew out of anger at her father, but then it sweetened into something that could honor of her mother. Then, in the last twenty-four hours, the idea grew even larger, evolving into something more, something exciting, and something erotic. As a teenager, she never fantasized about being a girl, but now that it had happened, it became increasingly exciting to her. She reached down and adjusted the swim trunks she’d borrowed from the stash of clothing the mers no longer needed, trying to restrain her penis.

As she watched Harold and Michael drag Malaki towards her, she tried to imagine feeling attracted to Harold. Intellectually, she could understand why a girl might be attracted to the short, but well-built young man. Harold’s dirty blond hair was long and wavy, and uncut since he had arrived on the island. His face was handsome, a strong chin, a quick and easy smile, and clear blue eyes. His modest build was well proportioned and deeply tanned. Valencia saw it all, but there was no spark, nothing.

She looked back over at Maja and Antonia, relaxing after feeding from the mermaids. Even after only a few feedings, the changes in both girls were dramatic. When they first arrived, each girl, though beautiful in her own way, was haggard, worn, and beaten down. Their hair was dull and tangled, their eyes sallow and dark, and their skin bruised and pockmarked. Now, both were the picture of health and vitality.

Valencia’s cock reassuringly twitched as her gaze washed over the two shorter women. Maja was a petite Filipina, barely five foot tall (154 cm), with classic dark hair, dark eyes, and a slender figure. Antonia also had dark hair, but she was nearly five inches taller than Maja and had flashing green eyes and a generous, attractive pear-shaped figure. Her face was a classic, pale oval, reflecting many New Zealanders’ Celtic heritage.

Valencia looked over her own, still male body. She and Harold were both about five feet eight inches tall, and she wondered if she would become much shorter. Her gaze swept back over the two girls, and she imagined herself becoming a delightful mix of those two. She wondered what breasts would actually feel like, and she hoped she would get ones more like Antonia’s than Maja’s breasts.

The three of them started feeding from mother mermaids the previous evening to prepare for the afternoon’s experiment. Harold had not fed, which was also part of the experiment. Valencia could still taste the sweetness of Petra’s milk she finished drinking only a few moments ago. Her hands trembled as she touched her lips, remembering the feeling of that incredible breast pressed into her mouth, the large nipple gushing milk down her throat. She didn’t think she wanted breasts that big, but the thought was exciting.

Valencia looked again at Petra. Oh my, she thought to herself, Petra used to be a man! It was hard for her to believe that anything so powerfully female, so beautiful, so graceful, could have once been a man. Her cock twitched again.

“Do you feel anything changing yet?” Maja asked, startling Valencia out of her reverie.

“Not really,” Valencia answered. “You?”

“Yes,” Maja answered. “I’m growing.”

“You and Antonia are slowly maturing to about your mid-twenties,” Petra answered. “And your breasts and hips are growing more than they might have normally. Valencia was already in her twenties, so she won’t change much until the type II’s kick in.”

“How much more will my breasts grow?” Maja asked, looking down at her tee shirt which was already tenting more dramatically since yesterday.

“Hard to tell,” Petra said. “Part of the experiment you guys are undertaking is that you’re not bonding to a male yet. Normally that focus has some influence. Once you get to the mountainside tub, the changes will finish in only a few minutes.”

“Only a few minutes, and I’ll be legal to drink in bars,” Maja giggled.

“Yes, and then you’ll look twenty-five or so for many, many, more years,” Petra said.

“How much influence can a male exert?” Valencia asked.

“A lot, as far as we can tell,” Petra said. “But it doesn’t have to be a male; it can be anyone with mer organs. I was among a mixed group when I became exactly what I wanted to be.”

“You wanted to look like that, I mean, the way that you do now?” Valencia asked her. “I mean you’re beautiful, but … um … wow.”

“Yes, I know,” said Petra smiling and stroking one of her incredible breasts. “You’re too young to remember, but there was a nude model who looked like me back in the 1980s. I asked my pod-mates to help me look like her, and it worked.”

“Valencia is still a male,” Maja said playfully. “Maybe you’re affecting my breasts?” She arched her slim body, pushing forward her small, but growing, breasts.

“It could be anyone here,” Valencia protested. “And if you don’t stop teasing me, you’ll ruin the experiment,” she continued, pushing her penis back between her legs. “I’m trying to become your sister-wife, and you’re not helping.”

“Maybe we are all affecting each other,” Antonia said, gently caressing Maja’s growing curves. “My breasts are growing too, but not as much as yours.”

“Mermaids have larger than average breasts,” Petra said, still stroking her extraordinary examples. “After all, they have to do a lot of work.”

“You didn’t need yours to grow,” Maja said to Antonia. “Yours were already beautiful.”

“I never thought I’d think of myself as beautiful ever again,” Antonia said, smiling and looking around at the paradise in which she found herself. “I hated my body, and I hated my life.”

“Me too,” Maja said. “I can’t believe we got rescued.”

“I can’t believe we’re going to be mermaids!” Antonia said.

“Tell me about it,” Valencia said, smiling at her future pod-mates. “I hope I turn out as beautiful as you two?”

“You’ll be beautiful,” Antonia said. “It starts on the inside; that’s where it counts.”

“Thanks, I’ll do my best,” Valencia said, a tear forming in her eye. “Is all of this o.k. with you two?” she asked.

“What do you mean, O.K.?” Antonia asked.

“You know, this whole changing and bonding thing,” Valencia said, looking down.

“I can’t wait,” Antonia said.

“Really?” Valencia asked.

“Thanks to your dad, my life was over, ruined,” Antonia said without malice. “I thought for a long time that I would die, and there were times when I really wanted to.”

“Me too,” Maja said, her attention drawn away from her breasts for a moment.

“This whole … everything … is … so … unexpected, so amazing,” Antonia continued, waving her hand over the horizon. “It’s like a rebirth, a second chance.”

“A baptism!” Maja said. “We have to go in water and everything to do it! We’re going to be reborn, baptized!”

“Yeah, well, I suppose you could look at it like that,” Antonia agreed.

“Sorry, I was raised Catholic,” Maja said. “But that sort of died after the fiftieth rape.”

“Anyway,” Antonia said, steering the conversation away from religion and prostitution. “I really like the vibe here, you know? I feel like I’m a little girl again, and I’ve regained some sense of my innocence that was taken from me.”

“Wow,” Valencia said. “Yea, I can see what you mean. I guess I feel that way too, except I don’t know what it’s like to be a little girl.”

“That’s alright, you can skip to the woman part,” Maja said. “I hated being a little girl, mostly because I was really little.”

“I think you’re beautiful,” Valencia said.

“Thanks. Hey, what do you want to look like?” Maja asked. “Even though this is an experiment, can we still affect her?” she asked, turning to Petra.

“I don’t know,” Petra said. “Your proto-mer organs may not be developed enough to affect the process, and those organs are what affects those changes.”

“What’s going to happen to me, do you think?” Valencia asked.

“I think you should end up looking like other women in your family,” Petra said. “But you all have had several feedings from mother mermaids, and the changes are much quicker with mother’s milk. So, maybe some effects will still be possible.”

“I hope so,” Valencia said. “I want to be little bit like both Maja and Antonia.”

“Man! All this talk … about changing! Wow! I don’t think I’ve ever been this turned on before in my life,” Maja said. “When I was a slave for Anjo, nothing ever turned me on. I had to fake everything, but now, everything seems to turn me on!”

“Sex is always wonderful when all the participants are willing,” Petra said. “That’s what’s so great about being a mer. There’s always someone loving you who is willing. Nothing is better than making love. Anyone can have sex.”

“And here it was that I thought I was just horny all the time,” Xing said, leaning over to kiss her pod-mate.

“You can call it anything you like,” Petra said after they kissed. “As long as you keep kissing me like that.”

“Valencia,” Pat called out as she emerged from the surf with several other mers. “You ready?”

“I’m ready,” Valencia answered, watching Pat salamander towards her.

“I’d like you all to swallow this,” she said as she pulled her hand from a pocket in her slim utility belt that nearly all the mers wore. In her palm were four small, purple capsules.

“These are sensors that will monitor your changes from within. It transmits data to this receiver,” she said as Phoebe handed her a small device. “If one of you will take this with you, it will relay the information to our computers in the lab.”

Antonia sprang up and examined one of the capsules in Pat’s hand.

“It won’t hurt him, I mean, her, will it?” she asked, looking protectively at Valencia.

“I’ll be fine,” Valencia said, taking a pill from Pat and swallowing it. Behind them, they heard Malaki’s muffled curses.

“The internal power will only last about six or seven hours, and it should pass naturally within a day or two,” Pat explained. “If it works, we’ll do ones for each of you when you transition to mers.”

“Well, alright then,” Antonia said, taking a pill and the small box from Pat. “But I’ll be mad if something happens to her.”

“I promise, the sensor is safe,” Pat said. “Now, off you go!”

Valencia took two pills and handed one to Maja and the last one to Harold, which they swallowed as well. Antonia swallowed hers and reached down to Maja and helped her up, and then the three “girls” joined hands and headed for the jungle path that would take them up to the hot tub. Behind them, Harold, Michael, Len, and Peter dragged Malaki who was refusing to do anything that his captors asked of him. They disappeared into the dense jungle.

“Alright, back to the lab, and let’s see what happens,” Pat said, the mers then returning to the sea as the afternoon sun beat down upon the waters of the lagoon.

The MuSu’s pod retreated to their favorite beach, where Trevor had first observed them making love. The Henderson triplets and their mate, MuSu, swam around the northern edge of the lagoon while Emma walked overland and met them there. Emma Henderson and the Basras weren’t scheduled to participate in their part of the experiments for a few more days, and so Emma’s daughters planned a family picnic for the afternoon.

They had just finished their picnic and were relaxing in the shallow surf, their mother still wearing one of Michael Thompson’s tee shirts. The surf on this side of the island normally surged up the steep coastline, crashing over the rocks on either side of the small, rocky cove, thumping onto the tiny beach. Today, however, the surf was gentle, and the group was taking shelter from the heat in the sea. They sat about two meters from the water line in about one meter of water, staying cool, and relaxing.

“We should ask them if you can start feeding,” Cleo said, stroking her mother’s face, her fingers tracing the horrific scars and burn marks.

“It’s O.K., my dear, I’ve lived with this face for a long time, and I can wait a few days more,” Emma said. “Besides, it’s about to become quite another face.”

“I wish you weren’t …” Cleo started, and then turned away.

“It’s O.K. dear,” Emma said, giving her daughter a pat on her shoulder. “I know it’s hard to lose your mother so soon after you got her back. But, you’ll really be getting both your father and I back, in a way.”

“I just … I can’t …” Cleo started crying into her hands and Rikki and her sister Emma gathered her into their arms. MuSu scooted over as well, adding a hand to the group hug.

“I know it’s hard, Cleo, but think of how brave mum’s being, and all that she’s been through,” Rikki said. “You wouldn’t want her to be reminded, for the rest of her life, about those terrible men and what they did to her, would you?”

“No, nooo, I … do … understand,” Cleo said between sobs. “I just wanted … my mother back. Why are you … doing this?”

“I think your sister Emma can answer that,” Emma said.

“Me?” her newest daughter squeaked. “What? I was a boy who wanted to be a mermaid, not a girl who wanted to be a merman.”

“Yes, exactly,” her mother answered. “Who you were on the outside didn’t match who you became on the inside.”

“I think I understand,” MuSu said. “You’ve been changed by your experiences, and you can’t simply go back to being Emma Henderson anymore than I can go back to being a silly and careless girl named Mai Lin.”

“Oh, MuSu,” Cleo said. “I want to forget those days forever! Promise me you’ll never mention them again.”

“Cleo, stop being so dramatic,” Rikki said. “MuSu, I’ll never forget those days, and you weren’t a silly or a careless girl. You were a beautiful and stubborn girl who refused to yield to your captors. You were very brave, in my opinion, and you’re still very brave.”

“It’s an act of bravery to love the three of us,” Emma said, grinning at her sisters.

“My life is for you three,” MuSu said simply.

He stiffened slightly, orienting on a patch of water about fifteen meters out. His girls felt the shark too, but they felt no danger and did turn around to watch. MuSu was there to protect them, after all. Emma Henderson, however, faced the surf and gasped when the dorsal fin emerged about ten meters out, rising to her feet.

“Shark!” she screamed.

“There is no danger,” MuSu said, keeping his eyes glued on the shark. “He is not hungry, just curious.”

“How can you tell?” Emma asked warily.

“He just can,” Emma said. “We all can, actually. It’s a part of our mer senses. We can sense things that are alive, and we can sense the mood they’re in.”

“He cannot eat twice,” MuSu said, watching the dorsal fin turn away from the beach. “Just as we cannot go back to what we once were.”

“Yes, well, I hope you’re right about the shark,” Emma senior said. “But, you’re right about me. I cannot go back. It would simply hurt too much, and if I’m to move forward, I need to move in a completely new direction. Now, Cleo, don’t cry anymore. I’m not dying. You’ve saved me! My three amazing and lovely children saved me! Now, I intend to make that miracle mean something. I’m going to give myself to the Basras and do my best to protect them, like MuSu does for you.”

“But we still need you!” Cleo said, still sniffling.

“You’ve got each other and MuSu,” Emma said. “And you’re nearly ready to be needed by someone else. Then you’ll know more about why I’m taking this new path.”

“Who else needs me?” Cleo whined.

“We do,” said Emma and Rikki together.

“We do, indeed,” MuSu repeated, turning away from the surf for a glance and a smile. “But your honorable mother did not mean us.”

“Who, then?” Cleo asked.

“Cleo! Seriously?” Rikki asked, exasperated.

“I don’t know,” Cleo whined.

“Our own children, Cleo! You know, babies. Sometimes I can hardly believe you’re my sister!” Emma said.

“Look who is talking!” Cleo shot back.

“Girls!” Emma senior interrupted. When she had their attention, she continued. “I think I let the fact that you all look much older than you are color my thinking. You may look twenty-five, but you’re still teenagers. Perhaps you need more time before you take on that responsibility, maybe in a few more years. Now, let’s enjoy ourselves for the afternoon with no more squabbling.”

“Sorry, mum,” Cleo said.

“Sorry, sis,” Emma said.

Rikki and MuSu sighed.

“So, mate to my daughters, what’s it like?” Emma asked. “Being a merman after being a girl?”

MuSu looked at his mother-in-law and pondered. After a moment, he said, “It has been an honorable choice; a blessing to be their mate. I think you will find that some of your same instincts will be useful after you have changed.”

“My instincts?” Emma asked.

“Though my gender has changed, I am still responsible to these little ones,” he said, nodding at his girls. “I cannot call it mothering, but being mated to them sometimes seems as I once imagined being a mother to children.”

“Are you sure that isn’t you and your particular mermaids?” Emma asked. “Now, I’m not saying you’re childish, but you are my children. I am allowed to make that judgement.”

“I’m not childish,” Cleo said. Emma and Rikki wisely kept quiet.

“I cannot speak intimately for others,” MuSu said. “However, my observations and conversations with other mermen support my conclusions. Each pod has its own personality, quirks, and needs, but loving another is always both a uncompromising sacrifice and a sacred pleasure. It would not be an exaggeration to say that loving three others requires even greater sacrifice, but it is attended with commensurate pleasure.”

“You are a wise merman, MuSu,” Emma said. “I hope I can be as wise as you. But I want to better prepare myself for the change. What should I expect?”

MuSu thought for a moment. Then he spoke.

“It is hard to say. Like yourself, I was abused by men, and my choice was partly to become strong--to not be a victim. The physical changes are significant, very much. The mental changes are even more profound. As a girl, I remember feeling it was allowable to be passive, and now that sentiment seems alien to me. There are many other things too. But …”

“But what?” Emma asked.

“But the sweetness of your mates cannot be described--the connection, the ache, the need, the desire. It is both wondrous and agonizing,” MuSu finished.

Emma watched as MuSu shared a look with her daughters that went beyond any look, any feeling, she could remember sharing with her own husband. She suddenly felt like a fifth wheel, so to speak, but just as she was about to leave, MuSu turned back to her and smiled.

“Such sweetness after such suffering is worthy of any sacrifice,” he said.

The butterflies started fluttering in Valencia’s stomach long before they arrived at the hot tub. For most of the hike up the mountain, her excitement and desire overwhelmed her fears. Her fears resurfaced when she saw the tub itself, filled with the microorganisms that would speed her change into a female once she triggered them. What might normally take several weeks or longer would now take minutes. She stopped, transfixed by the weight of what was about to happen to her.

“You alright?” Antonia asked. “I feel a little bloated.” She patted her bulging tummy under her tee shirt. The three of them had wolfed down as much protein as they could stand to serve as fuel for the changes now facing them.

“Me? I’m fine,” Valencia answered, trying to talk herself out of her fears. “It’s all just … it’s really ...”

“I think you’re being very brave,” Antonia said. “I don’t think I’ve told you that yet.” She paused, and then spoke. “I wasn’t prepared to like you when we first met, and after I found out who your father was, I liked you even less. But now, I’m pretty sure I’m going to like you more than just a little bit.”

“Thanks,” Valencia answered, feeling her cock reassuringly twitch in response to the attentions of a pretty girl. “I thought you were a beautiful girl the moment I first saw you, and I’m learning that you’re also a wonderful person. I’m very sorry for what my father’s men did.”

“Don’t worry about that,” Antonia said. “It wasn’t your fault, and besides, you’re proving yourself to be very different from him.”

“Yea, I’m going to be really, really different from him in just a little while,” Valencia said with a laugh. “I just hope I can do it. I mean, I don’t know if I really can force myself to surrender.”

“What do you mean?” she asked. “You think being a girl is surrender? I know what the mers said about the hormones and stuff, but being a girl is not about being passive or giving up. Are you afraid to become a girl?”

“No, no!” Valencia answered. “I know what you mean. My mother was the strongest person I knew, even though she was … anyway, no, I want to be a girl. It’s just that … I have always tried to … well, to be honest, I can never seem to do anything right,” she confessed in a quiet voice.

“You’ve been doing things right for the past few days,” Antonia said. “Besides, we’ll help you if you need it. Maja and I won’t leave you.”

“That’s what is keeping me sane,” Valencia said. “I know we haven’t known each other for long, but I can’t tell you how much it means to me that you’re in this with me. I already feel closer to you than I have to any other person since my mother.”

“Well, that’s about the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me,” Antonia said, giving her a kiss on the cheek. “Besides, I meant what I said; we will not abandon you. Besides, there’s always Harold if it comes to that. The experiment can go hang if you get stuck.”

“I know,” Valencia said. “But I really want to show myself and my father that I can do this from within, without being held down by someone else.”

“And so you will!” Antonia said. “Now, you just march over to that pool and show your father what real courage is.”

Valencia squared her shoulders and took a few deep breaths to calm herself down. She walked over and sat on the edge of the pool, watching as the men dragged her father to the other side.

The four men dragged Malaki to the far side of the hot tub near where the bamboo piping brought water to this rocky outcropping. They lashed the still struggling man to rocks marking the start of the cliff rising above and further beyond the pool. Harold showed Antonia where the listening hole was, and after securing Malaki, all four men returned to the huts to await the end of this stage of the experiment.

Antonia carefully placed the relay box next to the listening hole, and then returned to the rocky pool. Maja had already taken off her tee shirt and was in the pool, and so Antonia lifted her tee shirt away and joined her. They both dunked themselves in the water, washing off the grime of the hike, and then drifted towards the ledge facing away from the mountain, enjoying the view. Valencia was also enjoying the view of the two young girls as the water cascaded off their bodies.

“Anything yet?” Maja asked.

“No,” Antonia said. “Pat said it might take a few minutes to start,”

Maja nodded, and then turned to Valencia.

“Just a few minutes more,” she winked at the apparent young man. “Then you can join us.”

“Literally,” Antonia said, nervously.

The two girls swam for a few more minutes, enjoying the warm water. Then, Antonia remembered what Pat had told her about the rocks, and she placed several over some of the holes next to the cliff wall that were whistling with warm air. Soon the redirected air forced bubbles to appear in the hot tub. The bubbles were large and burped as they surfaced.

“That’s nice,” Maja said. “It tickles.”

After a few more minutes of swimming, they noticed microscopic bubbles forming on their bodies.

“It’s started,” Maja said, watching as the tiny bubbles began to break free from her body.

The both settled into the center of the pool to watch the progress their bodies were making. Soon, hundreds of thousands of tiny bubbles were breaking free all over their bodies.

“That’s amazing,” Valencia said, watching the water gently fizz around the two girls.

“Oh, my,” Maja groaned. “My hips hurt.”

“Mine don’t,” Antonia said, “but my shoulders do.”

“You’re maturing to your mid-twenties in mere minutes,” Valencia reminded them. “Pat said it would cause some discomfort.”

“This isn’t discomfort,” Maja complained. “This hurts.”

“Duck under the water,” Antonia said. “Let’s get this over with.”

Both girls ducked under the water, bubbles forming on their faces and hair as well. They held themselves below the surface for about thirty seconds or so, and then surfaced for a breath and sank again.

Valencia turned her attention to her father as he watched the two pretty girls transforming themselves into proto-mers. She snorted as she watched him leer at them despite his circumstances. Malaki was still a man, and both Maja and Antonia were beautiful young women who were becoming even more beautiful. After about five minutes, the bubbles stopped forming, and both girls stood up in the pool.

They had changed dramatically. Their hair had grown down to their hips. Maja’s slender figure had matured into a classic hourglass, her A-cup breasts were now a modest C, her hips wider, and her face lost its baby fat. Antonia’s face also matured, her breasts were now a D-cup, and her torso was hourglass shaped, her shoulders matching her generous hips. Like all proto-mermaids, both girls’ nipples had grown as well, each rising like a mini-volcano from the round, soft surface of their larger breasts.

“That felt incredible,” Maja said. “Antonia, turn around, quick! Let me see your back.”

Antonia spun around, and Maja parted Antonia’s hair and exposed her back. There, both Valencia and Maja could see the pink areas of her skin that soon would become her gills.

“How’s that feel?” Maja asked as she stroked the pink strips lightly.

“Oh, sensitive,” Antonia shivered away from Maja, turning towards Valencia. “We’ve got proto-mer organs, so we can help you become whatever you want.”

“Just make me beautiful, a mix of the two of you,” Valencia said, taking her swim trunks off and slipping into the water, her stiff cock jutting from her still male body.

“What do we do?” Maja asked.

“Just focus on her as she changes,” Antonia said. “Imagine how she should look, put a picture in your mind.”

“And that will work?” Maja asked.

“That’s what they told us,” Antonia said.

The warm water caressed Valencia as she slipped in, her modestly sized penis painfully erect. Pushing herself towards the center of the pool, she let her knees rest on the bottom, her chin just reaching the top of the still bubbling water. She faced her father and felt the anger and hurt she’d born all these years rise to the surface again. Tears began to flow down her cheeks as she stared at her father, feeling sad for her mother, for her brothers, and for the lives that this selfish man had manipulated, used, and discarded.

“Just focus on relaxing, on letting the siren cells change you,” Antonia said. “We’re supposed to just stay in the tub with you.”

Valencia nodded, and returned her gaze to her father. She tried to relax, but the anxieties that swirled within her wouldn’t let her. She screwed her eyes shut, concentrating, but after a few minutes she opened them. Nothing was happening.

Even with the gag, Malaki’s laugh of derision was clear to his son and the two girls. Valencia stood up and made a move to swim over to him to confront him.

“No!” Antonia said, stopping her. “Don’t let anger overwhelm you. Concentrate on relaxing. Remember that there is strength in bending before the wind. A woman’s strength is different from a man’s, but it is strength just the same. You’re not surrendering, you’re becoming.”

Valencia stopped and looked at her future sister-wife. She saw the compassion in her eyes, and laid back into the water. She closed her eyes and focused on relaxing. After calming herself, she opened her eyes.

“Watch me father,” she said softly, like a sigh, holding her arms in front of her, just under the surface. “Two sons are now female dolphins, another is a stupid, selfish brute who’s probably going to be killed without your protection, and your youngest son is becoming a mermaid. Who will run your empire now?”

Malaki struggled against his shackles, but the ropes were too secure. The gag muffled another series of swear words, but the strain of being tied up for several days was taking its toll, and he gave up after only a few seconds.

“Look, father, the bubbles are beginning to form,” said Valencia as the prickling, tingling bubbles started to gather. A sense of triumph washed over her, and she smiled.

She held her position for several seconds, but the bubbles slackened and then disappeared. She saw her father’s eyes gleam in triumph again. She looked over at her pod-mates and said, in a small voice, “Help.”

They both looked at Valencia’s father, and then back at the boy who was trying to become a girl. They nodded to one another and moved closer, arranging themselves on either side of Valencia.

Maja dipped a cupped hand into the water and raised it over Valencia’s head.

“Do you want to join us?” she asked.

Valencia nodded.

“Do you accept the gift of womanhood and the love of your sister-wives?” Antonia asked, getting into the spirit of the moment.

“Yes, very much,” Valencia said.

“Do you wish to know the special strength and power that being a woman entails?” Antonia continued.

“Yes, I do,” Valencia said, looking at her father. His eyes were wide with terror.

Each girl each put a hand on a shoulder and focused their thoughts on Valencia turning into a girl.

“Give yourself to us,” Antonia whispered in Valencia’s ear.

“Bend before the wind,” Maja said, and she poured the water over Valencia’s head.

Valencia gasped as the warm water flowed down her scalp, and a shiver ran through her body. Their hands on her shoulders felt comforting and sensuous. She wasn’t sure if she was imagining it, but she felt SOMETHING coming from each girl. With her sister-wife’s words and soft breath in her ears, she looked at her father with a different sense of strength and determination. She felt connected to these two girls, and relaxed into that connection.

Her past seemed to rise up within her, but she focused her feelings on the connection she was sharing with these girls, using that warmth and love to erase those hurts and pains. She remembered the beatings suffered as a young boy, the feelings of loss when her mother was killed, and the taunts of her schoolmates because she was Malaki’s son. She focused on accepting these losses, on giving herself to her emotions and to the energies of the two girls. The microscopic bubbles reappeared.

“Look father, it’s working,” Valencia said. “I’m giving up my manhood, I’m … ooooohhhhhhhhhhh,” she groaned as the water around her began to boil, the bubbles increasing, rolling off her body like a sudden storm.

She closed her eyes and forced a smile on her face, knowing that her smile would torture her father. Maja and Antonia’s hands left her shoulder, forced away by the millions of tiny bubbles erupting all over her skin. A mist of tiny bubbles rose around her head as they fizzed all around her. The water smelled like ozone after a thunderstorm. Pressure built up over her entire body, and she began to moan as her body was reshaping from the inside out.

A pain stabbed at her abdomen, and she doubled over, her head pitching forward into the water. She screamed into the water, knowing her father wouldn’t hear it, her own air joining the millions of bubbles all around her. She felt bubbles form on her face, and she braced herself, holding herself underwater, willing the change to flow through her body.

The siren cells and the microorganisms assaulted her face, and her skull felt like jelly. She forced herself to remain under, her lungs burning. Maja and Antonia pulled gently on her shoulders, turning her in the water so that she faced the surface. She lifted her face briefly, gasping in a fresh breath of air, and then surrendered herself back to the power of the water and the bubbles. She went limp, knowing her podmates would support her body, allowing her head to stay below the surface of the rolling water for a few seconds and then pulling her up for a quick breath.

Valencia relaxed her legs and they extended out towards her father, her body just below the surface of the water. Enormous pressures burst within her lower abdomen. Her hips seemed to be on fire, and her feet crushed. There was pain, but it was bearable, and more importantly, she could focus on it, give herself to it, let it bend her. The bubbles continued to boil as the changes swept over her body.

The water pulled at her scalp, and she knew that her hair was growing at a phenomenal rate. Another gasping breath and then below again as her torso compressed, her ribs aching, her waist creeping up towards her ribs and shrinking, her internal organs shifting and changing. Her chest went into spasms, and accidentally she drank some water, feeling it burn as she half-swallowed and half-aspirated the foaming liquid. She rose, coughed out some water, took another breath, and forced herself back under the surface.

She felt a mighty tug in her groin, forcing her hips to the surface, inadvertently flashing her father as her body absorbed her male genitals. She gasped another breath and sank again, the bubbles seeming to pull the skin from her body. The jelly like feeling in her face and skull passed, and her bones stopped aching. She took another breath and sank.

A tightness grew in her chest and then a pressure, and her breasts began to grow. They pushed out into the water, her nipples expanding and growing, the bubbles tickling them into mini erections. Then slowly, the pressure and the bubbles eased, the water calmed, and Valencia floated to the surface.

As she took a calming breath, she could feel the air on her face and breasts as they poked up from the water, her nipples tightening further. She let her wide hips drop and found the bottom of the pool with her feet. She tilted her head back to force her now very long hair to slide down her back as she lifted her head from the water. Then she lifted her hands and looked at her now slender and beautiful appendages, water dripping from her fingers. She smiled at Antonia and Maja, feeling a new level of connection to her pod-mates, knowing that soon they would be joining them in an even more profound and beautiful way.

She lifted her eyes to her father and saw his open terror. She smiled again, knowing that her smile was now beautiful, wide, and full.

“Father, how do I look?” she asked slowly rising up onto her feet, the water lapping at her belly button, her breasts settling onto her chest, their weight pulling her forward slightly. Her hair plastered along her back, and she felt her new center of gravity between her wide hips.

Malaki shook his head, refusing to believe that the beauty that stood before him was his son. My god, he thought his eyes wide with shock, what were these monsters going to do to him?

“I think you’re beautiful,” Maja said breathlessly. “That was amazing to watch.”

“What do I look like?” Valencia asked.

“You look wonderful! Oh, you look a lot like Vanessa Minnillo,” Maja said. “She was born in the Philippines but is an actress in America. She is half Filipino and half Irish-Italian.”

“I don’t know who that is,” Antonia admitted. “And I don’t care. You are the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. I can’t believe I’m getting this turned on by a woman.”

“You two have been turning me on since I first saw you,” Valencia said. “But we should let Harold know we’re ready for the next phase of the experiment. I don’t want him,” jerking her head towards her father, “to be here for any of that.”

Antonia glided over to the edge of the pool and lifted herself up and out, the water sluicing off her sleek, pale body. She walked over to the tree line and peered down the path towards the huts. “Harold, we’re ready,” Antonia shouted through the trees. She turned on her heel and looked back at the pool.

“What are you two looking at?” she asked innocently.

“You’re so beautiful,” Valencia said. “I mean, you were beautiful before, but now …”

“Yea,” Maja said.

“Thanks, mates,” Antonia said, walking back towards the pool like a model on a catwalk. “A girl could get used to this attention.”

She stepped back into the pool, ducked under the water, pushed off the bottom, and swam underwater over to join her two pod-mates. She popped up between them, and she pressed her body against Valencia’s, their breasts pressing together.

“Hey old man,” Antonia shot over her shoulder towards Malaki. “It’s too bad you won’t get to see the next part of the experiment. You have no idea what you’re missing.” She kissed Valencia deeply as Maja stroked their bodies.

Malaki tried to curse, but he felt drained, physically and emotionally. He just hung there limply, trapped in the ropes.

The girls broke off their kiss when they heard the four men approaching up the path. They watched the men untie Malaki and pull him over to a stretcher they brought. Malaki never struggled and lay unmoving on the stretcher after they dropped him on it.

“Just in case he’s playing possum,” Michael said, lashing him securely.

Peter and Len grabbed the front of the stretcher and Michael and Harold lifted the rear. They stood up in unison.

“Harry will be back in a little while. Don’t get started without him,” Michael teased as they began their march back down the mountain.

“Harold. My name is Harold,” he said with a laugh, as they started down the mountain. He turned just before he disappeared into the jungle for a last look at his girls.

The three of them stood in the center of the pool, holding hands. They looked at him expectantly, their young, trim bodies covered with a sheen of water. They were each extraordinarily beautiful women, their bodies the picture of sensual, sexual ripeness.

“I’ll be right back,” he shouted.

Valencia watched Harold’s butt as he disappeared into the jungle. His butt! At last! There was a spark!

“He’s got a cute butt,” Antonia said. “Don’tcha think?”

Valencia smiled and blushed.

“Give her time,” Maja said. “Remember the first time you thought boys weren’t icky?”

“I don’t think she feels like boys are icky anymore,” Antonia said.

“At least not that one,” Valencia said, nodding towards the retreating men.

“Well, are you ready for part two?” Antonia asked.

“We’re going to bond just with each other, right?” Maja asked.

“Yes, they are going to monitor changes to our mer organs,” Antonia said.

“There’s no going back once we have sex together, right?” Maja asked.

“That’s right, we’ll be bonded,” Valencia said. “Are you sure you want me?”

“Are you kidding? You’re the hottest thing I’ve ever seen!” Maja said. “I finally feel like a woman who wants to have sex instead of one who is forced to!”

“Valencia, you’ve proven yourself to be a good person, and now you’re a beautiful woman,” Antonia said, turning towards her. “Please become my sister wife? You too, Maja, let’s make this official.”

“Kay,” Maja said, as they both faced Valencia in the pool.

“Do you, Valencia, take Maja and I to be your sister wives?” Antonia asked.

Valencia gazed at the petite beauty who was becoming her pod-mate, a quickening rising in her abdomen as her gaze washed over Maja’s curves. Her long dark hair glistened as it lay plastered against her light brown skin. Her Clara Bow lips were open, and her light brown eyes sparkled with light as she returned Valencia’s gaze.

Valencia’s eyes flicked over to Antonia, the middle girl perfectly positioned between Maja’s five foot even and her own five foot eight. Valencia admired Antonia’s generously curved body, much more luscious than her own. Antonia’s dark hair contrasted sharply with her pale skin, her large breasts bursting through the veil of black hair. Her light green eyes were also appraising the young woman who returned her gaze, and her lush lips spreading in a hungry smile of approval.

“I do,” she said, her voice husky with desire.

“Do you, Maja …” Antonia started.

“I do, I do! Both of you!” Maja said, interrupting. “Do you, Antonia take Valencia and I?”

“I do,” Antonia said, glancing at both girls. There was a pause.

Valencia felt both girls’ eyes wash over her, and she shivered. She watched as Antonia’s eyes moved over her face, then down her graceful throat to her new, firm C-cups, jutting from her sleek and slender torso. She glanced down at her breasts for the first time and watched as her nipples crinkled with excitement, pointing directly at the other young women standing in the pool. She felt a warmth build in her belly and bent over to look at her wide hips, her soft, feminine stomach, and the soft patch of hair now hiding her new vagina, the water just covering the top of her patch of new hair.

“Let us bond,” Antonia said, bringing her hands up to her breasts, stroking them.

Valencia took her breasts in her hands and felt their weight, slowly pulling on them, teasing her nipples. She watched as both Antonia and Maja did the same. The weight and texture of her breasts felt wonderful in her hands, and it was even more exciting to watch the two other girls match her own movements. Their eyes fluttered with passion, their breath coming in labored gasps as they stroked their own bodies together.

“Yes, let’s start like this,” Maja said.

Valencia groaned and pulled hard on her nipples, the sharp, sweet sensation racing between her breasts and her throbbing vagina. She let one hand drop, snaking towards her crotch. Heat seemed to flow from her new genitalia, even in comparison to the warm water in the pool. She dipped a finger into her new opening and gasped, from both the searing heat that gripped her digit and the tightness penetrating it.

“Oh … goooooooooodddddd,” she groaned as she moved her finger in and out of her sex. “It never felt like this before.”

“You never had a vagina before,” Antonia said, panting.

The girls matched each other, their hands reaching down to caress and finger their vaginas as they teased and stroked other parts of their bodies. They stood together in a triangle in the pool, facing each other. The water bubbled from the hot air vents around them; the water lapping at Maja’s belly button, Antonia’s hips, and Valencia’s crotch.

“I’ve never diddled in front of another girl before,” Maja said breathlessly. “This is so hot!”

“When I had to do it for clients, I hated it. But this is wonderful! I feel so good,” Antonia agreed. “God, you’re both so beautiful!”

They all continued to stroke and pull on their bodies, watching each other as they began to twitch and jerk towards orgasm. They slowly moved closer to one another, their breasts brushing against one another’s arms, breasts, and torsos. They sought as much contact as was possible without stopping the stimulation they gave themselves.

“You’re getting close, aren’t you?” Antonia asked Valencia.

“I don’t know,” she answered, her breathing coming in short gasps. “I’ve never done anything like this before.”

“My breasts feel funny,” Maja said. “But in a good way.”

“Ummmmmm, mine too,” Antonia said, arching her back so her breasts pressed into both her pod-mates. “Something is happening.”

The breast Antonia was pulling on began leaking milk, dripping into the pool. She moaned in pleasure and switched her hands so that she could pull on her other breast while still rubbing her vagina. Soon, her other breast began leaking.

“That’s so hot,” Maja said, pulling harder on her breasts. “Why won’t mine go?”

“Relax,” Antonia said. “It’s both physical and mental. Just let it down, you’ll feel it go,” she said, milk now dripping steadily from both of her magnificent breasts.

Maja bent over and licked some of the milk oozing from Antonia’s breasts. “Ummmm, sweet.”

She closed her eyes, and soon her breasts started leaking milk too.

“That feels so incredible,” Maja said. “So good.”

Valencia’s breasts grew heavier, and she visualized her milk flowing down from her breasts and out her nipples. A spasm in her vagina jerked her hips forward.

“Ohhh, yessss,” she moaned, keeping her fingers busy. A tiny tingle signaled the start of her milk, her nipples almost painfully erect.

“Yesssss, it’s started,” she said, her body jerking and twitching, milk dribbling from her nipples.

“I’m gonna cum,” Maja panted. “I can’t … believe it … never … like … this … before … ahhhhh.”

Maja groaned out her orgasm, her breasts suddenly spraying milk into the pool.

“Oh … gooooooodddddd,” Antonia said, her fingers furiously working her crotch.

Antonia looked up, caught Valencia’s eyes, and both watched each other’s orgasms erupt. Antonia yipped and squealed as her orgasm overtook her body, mermaid milk flowing from her breasts. Valencia groaned as a column of pleasure rose up from her womb, shaking her torso back and forth, and her shoulders jerking forwards and back as each spasm raced through her body. Milk sprayed from their breasts, covering everyone in a fine mist of white.

They collapsed into a group hug, sinking into the water up to their necks, their bodies still jerking and twitching from the powerful echoes of their orgasms. They spent a few minutes kissing each other, moving from one pair of lips to the other, sometimes all three pressing their lips and intertwining their tongues together. As their passion cooled, they moved over to one side of the pool, Antonia’s back to the wall and Maja and Valencia pressed against her.

“Oh, my gosh, that was amazing,” Maja said, resting her head on Antonia’s upper breast. “I’ve never felt anything like that … ever.”

“Best experience ever,” Antonia agreed.

“We’re bonded,” Valencia said in a whisper. “I can feel it.”

All three girls closed their eyes, savoring the connection that had grown between them, like an invisible tug pulling on their hearts and heads, sharing the heat of one another’s skin as they rested against each other. They stayed that way for a few minutes.

“Are we done?” Valencia asked.

“Nope, just catching our breath,” Antonia said. “We have time. Harold won’t be back for at least a half hour.”

“Good,” Valencia said.

“Well?” Antonia asked her. “Do you feel like you lost your manhood?”

“No!” Valencia said, wrapping her legs around Antonia’s right leg, pressing her still quivering crotch against her thigh. “I’ve gained … I can’t begin to tell you.” She kissed Antonia passionately. “I feel so (kiss) wonderful, so (kiss) alive, so (long kiss) loved,” she said in between kisses. She kissed Maja, feeling her body pressing against these two lovely creatures.

“I just don’t want to stop,” Valencia said, kissing her way down Maja’s neck to her breasts that still dripped milk.

“Then don’t,” Maja said, pushing her breasts into Valencia’s kisses.

“Harold won’t know what hit him,” Antonia said.

Bonnie was again on duty at the computer when a sailboat approached from the eastern shore, the rising sun glancing off its battered and worn mast as it neared. Jack recognized it as one of the locals, but he was surprised when Kyle Johnson stepped off the boat and waved good-bye to whomever it was that had ferried him across. Jack wondered what Kyle must have told him about why his own boat was on the island.

“Looks like the storm has temporarily passed,” Jack said, reaching over to the controls for the blast door. “I’ll leave the ceiling closed up until I know more about what’s going on. You guys just hang out until I get more information.”

“Roger that,” Mac said.

“We will continue to study the flora and fauna of the Chesapeake Bay,” Annette said, scooting over to the computer. “We are NOT going to eat MREs for the rest of our time here.”

“Roger that,” Bonnie said. “I seem to have lost my taste for those things.”

“That’s not all you’ve lost,” Joy teased.

“I haven’t lost anything, as you very well know,” Bonnie said, hefting a breast towards Joy. “I have breasts any time I want them and a cock whenever I ask politely.”

“You don’t need to ask,” Mac said. “I feel like I’m twenty again!”

Jackson rolled his eyes and turned to face the slowly opening door. “I think I should leave you guys alone for awhile,” he said.

“Why?” Mac joked. “You’ve been watching us for the past two days and that never bothered us before.”

Jack slipped through the slowly opening door and headed up the passageway. He wasn’t squeamish about sex; he wanted to get away because he didn’t trust himself around the mermaids. God, he was horny. He hadn’t felt that kind of desire … ever! As he marched up the passageway, he resolved that no matter what had happened to Kyle, he wasn’t going to wait any longer than he had to. He was going to become a merman with his own mermaids as soon as possible.

He opened the secret door, closed it behind him, resetting the pipe, and then took the stairs two at a time up into the kitchen. He found Kyle sitting at the table, reading a newspaper.

“Whatcha reading?” he asked, sitting down across the table.

“Supermarket tabloid,” Kyle answered, lowering it to the table. “Mermaids made the front page,” he said, pushing it across to Jack.

Jack quickly scanned News of the World, seeing the article on the prostitutes in the Philippines. He glanced over the other articles on the front page.

“Your new friends show you this?” Jack asked.

“Nope,” Kyle said. “You want some coffee?”

“Nah,” Jack said.

He watched Kyle set up the coffee maker for a fresh pot.

“You O.K.?” he asked.

“Me?” Kyle said. “Fine.”

Kyle waved his hand around the room and shrugged his shoulders, and Jack understood. Bugs.

“Good,” Jack answered. “Do you know what happened to my stuff?”

“Your computers and such?” Kyle asked.

“Yup,” Jack said.

“Nope,” Kyle answered.

“Maybe I was robbed,” Jack said.

“Maybe,” Kyle agreed. “Maybe you should call someone.”

“Who am I gonna call?” Jack asked, smiling as he did.

Kyle paused, sharing the pun with his old friend. “I donno, maybe your old boss in Washington, what’s her name?”

“Susan?” Jackson asked.

“Yea, that’s her,” Kyle agreed. “I’d start there.”

Jack walked over to his phone and gave it a good, long look. He picked it up and listened to the dial tone, hearing the extra interference on the line. He nodded to Kyle, and then dialed the number into the phone. After a few rings, someone answered.

“Hello. Welcome to the technology help desk, how may I help you?” a voice said.

“Hi, my name is Jackson Baker, and I seem to have a problem with my computer,” he said.

“What sort of problem are you having?” the voice asked.

“I can’t be sure,” Jackson said. “But I think the mount point on my hard drive has shifted and data may have been compromised.”

There was a pause on the other side. Then, “We’re sorry sir. We are unable to assist you at this time over the phone. Can you be available for a home visit?”

“I can try,” Jackson said. “I’ve had some unexpected visitors, but I think my schedule is pretty clear now.”

“Yes, sir. Thank you,” the voice said. “We’re checking into that now.”

There was another long pause. Then, “customer service is important to us; might we come by later this afternoon?” the voice asked.

“As long as it’s just your technicians,” Jack said. “There are some other issues I’m having as well.”

“Yes, sir. It will be authorized personnel only,” the voice said. “What are your other issues?”

“I had a custom shortwave access point, and it seems to have been disabled,” Jack said.

“Thank you sir, just a minute,” the voice answered.

There was another, longer pause this time. Then, “We will have our technician bring equipment to test your shortwave access. Are there any other issues we should address at this time?” The voice asked.

“No thanks, I think that’s got it covered,” Jack answered.

“Thank you for calling the Technology Help Desk,” the voice answered and clicked off.

Jack hung up the phone and smiled.

“Well?” Petra asked as her head popped up in the lab pool.

“She did it!” Phoebe reported while salamandering over to the pool.

Pat and Galina remained hunched over their computer screens, and several other new machines clicked and whirred throughout the room.

“And the other girls?” Xing asked, her face emerging next to her podmate.

“Good transitions,” Phoebe continued. “Levels of siren cells were strong, and Harold will be drinking from his own pod-mates rather than someone else.”

“It will be too bad to lose Harold’s help up top, but that will be a strong pod, I can tell,” Pat said, lifting her head from her computer.

“What about bonding?” Petra asked.

“Well, it starts right away, from the first seconds, it seems,” said Phoebe. “Levels of progesterone increased as soon as they were in proximity to one another, with most of it coming from a group of Type I siren cells that seemed to form a cytoplasmic mass in the upper GI.”

“You have all that already?” Petra asked.

“We have excellent, new equipment,” Galina said, lifting her head from a computer near the rear of the lab. “And we work quickly.”

“And you’re the smartest mers I know,” Petra said, smiling. Her face changed as a tingle shivered up her mer senses.

“Um, wait a sec,” Petra said, ducking under the water.

A few seconds later, she resurfaced, holding Michelle.

“Trevor’s pod is back!” Petra said. “And they want to speak with all of us right away.”

“It had better be important,” Galina groused, staring at the data on her screen.

“Do you want to stay?” Pat asked, knowing how dedicated her fellow scientist was to her work.

“The subroutines will continue to collect and back data up as it comes in,” Galina said, punching a few keys. “Petra is teaching me the value of family over work.” She smiled at her sister-wife.

“We’re getting to be a bigger and bigger family every day,” Pat sighed, punching a few keys of her own.

“We’ll meet on the beach, the moon pool is getting crowded,” John said, popping up in the lab pool. “Danni and the kids are already on their way.”

“She’s going to let them swim all that way?” Pat asked, worried.

“No, we’ll catch up with them before they get much past the main entrance,” John said, smiling at Pat’s attack of maternal worry. “Mermaid taxi service will take them around the island and into the lagoon.”

“Oh, right, of course,” said Pat shuffling towards the pool. “Well, what are we waiting for, let’s go.”

She dove into the pool and headed down the softly glowing tunnel. The other mers followed, Phoebe and John catching up to Pat as she entered the Moon Pool. The large pool was empty, a long shaft of light from the early evening sun played along the cave ceiling, and the mers continued through to the main tunnel. Here, they could swim four abreast, and before they reached the main entrance out into the sea, they caught up to Danni and the three children.

[This is an urchin,] Danni said, pointing to the small creature attached to tunnel wall. [Careful, ouchy.]

The three tiny mermaids peered closely at the dark, spiny creature but withheld their inquisitive fingers from the spikes waving in the water. The mers had discovered that although the baby mermaids still lacked language, their mer senses allowed them to feel caution, fear, joy, and other emotions from their parents.

[There’s my girl,] Pat said, scooping up Maureen, the tiny mermaid squealing with surprise.

[Get ready for a trip!] she said to her daughter, marveling how the child understood immediately to plaster herself along her mother’s stomach, her head nestled between Pat’s breasts, as her mother started swimming out into the open sea.

Phoebe and Danni collected their daughters and John moved ahead to the tip of their diamond formation. Pat dropped back to the rear, with Danni on her left and Phoebe on her right. Instinctively the baby mermaids kept themselves tucked within their mother’s draft. John kept the pace slow so that his daughters wouldn’t be ripped from their mothers’ sides, but the mers still swam faster than most humans could normally. Soon, they were in the lagoon. As they approached the beach, they let their daughters loose and they gleefully tumbled in the shallow surf as their mothers salamandered up onto the beach.

Trevor and his girls were waiting for everyone to assemble. They had already met Michael Thomson and his crew, Emma and the Basras, and they had heard about Harold as his new pod were going to spend the night up in the mountainside huts. Jaclyn and Janice were fawning over Rose, who was blushing from all the attention.

“Where’s the rest of Eric’s pod?” Trevor asked looking around.

“Up the mountain setting up the new uplink,” Liga said. “I wish my mer senses worked in the air.”

“We’re finally getting one with enough bandwidth for full telecom connections?” Ann asked.

“Yes,” Pat answered. “Someday, you’ll be able to video chat with old friends.”

“Only from the waist up,” Kate said.

“Not even that,” Ann said, suddenly realizing. “I mean, look at our eyes, Elana would know that something about us has really changed.”

“Oh, god, that bitch!” Kate exclaimed, thinking of her former college roommate. “Last time I saw her, she called me a frigid prude.”

“Those are two words that could never describe you,” Ann confirmed as she leaned in for a sensual kiss.

“Thanks,” Kate agreed allowing her fingers to brush across Ann's tail, teasing the fringes on her hip fins as she pulled away.

Ann shuddered at the attention, “Oh, god! Can you imagine what she’d think if she saw us now?”

“Well, maybe someday you’ll get to find out, but first, we’re going to find out what’s happening with Mac and Joy,” Jaclyn said. “And we can talk about who you might be allowed to talk to and why. We’re not going to be able to keep ourselves secret forever, and we’re going to need friends and allies.”

“Speaking of friends and allies, that’s why I wanted to make a general report,” Trevor said. “But how much longer will Eric, Sally, and Alexis be? I don’t want to have to repeat myself.”

“You won’t have to repeat anything,” Liga said. “We’re pod-mates, remember? I’ll be able to share every nuance if necessary. Out with it!”

“Oh, right, I forgot,” said Trevor. “So, yea, we rescued some people.”

“What?” Pat asked.

“Where are they? What do they know? What did you do? Why did you do it?” Several mermaids and mermen all asked at once.

“We did what was right,” Rose said, defensively.

“I’m sure you did,” Pat said. “We’re just nervous. Let’s everyone settle down, and let them explain what happened.”

Rose then launched into the tale of their trip, how they had set The Device and became pregnant without realizing what she was doing. She then explained how they came upon the wreckage and discovered the raft, found the four humans near death, towed them to an atoll, and then decided the only way to save them was to feed them mermaid milk. She explained who they were, and what their personalities were like, while she and her sister-wives speculated on what might be the possible outcomes.

“Josh and Jenna seemed very excited about becoming mers, but the other two didn’t,” Rose said.

“Yea, that older woman, Sarah, seemed particularly put off by everything,” Kate said. “She was like totally, take me back to my job, pronto!”

“But all of them drank from you, right?” Pat asked.

“Yes,” Rose answered. “Josh and Jenna from me …”

“And you’re pregnant,” Pat said.

“Yes,” Trevor answered. “Her signal changed.”

“And Kate and I fed the other two,” Ann said.

“And you’re not pregnant,” Pat said.

“Not yet,” Kate said, blushing.

“Are they going to be alright?” Rose asked. “I mean should we go back and get them?”

“Well, first, we really need to find out what’s happened to Mac and Joy,” Pat said. “I assume that they made the transition safely, which suggests that your original plan to let nature take its time might be the best for Josh’s pod in the long run. If Sarah and the other girl …”

“Manami,” Rose said.

“Manami, needs someone to blame, it can be me,” Pat finished.

The sound of something coming through the jungle interrupted their conversation.

“I hope that’s Eric’s pod,” John said, eyeing the jungle as dusk approached. “Why aren’t they coming down the path?”

After a few seconds, the crashing got louder, and Eric and Sally emerged from the jungle about twenty meters north of the path, covered in debris.

“Hey guys!” Eric said, beaming.

“Where’s Alexis and Peter?” Pat asked.

“They’re coming down the path,” Sally said. “Eric wanted to try some bushwhacking.”

“What’s bushwhacking?” Rangi asked.

“Nothing fun,” Mae said.

“Bushwhacking is making a path where none yet exists,” Bill explained to his other mate. “You whack at the bushes in your way, marching through the jungle. When we go through a seaweed forest underwater, you could say that we are weed whacking.”

“Now that is funny,” Eric said. “We’re going to do that next time!”

“It was a blast, wasn’t it?” Sally agreed.

Eric turned and got his first look at his mate since they emerged from the jungle. Tangled in her hair were bits of leaves, and a fine layer of grit covered every part of her. She pointed to a twig dangling in his hair and giggled. He stifled a laugh, unsuccessfully, and together he and Sally burst out laughing.

“Next time you go second and get all those branches in your face,” Sally said her laughter abating. “Let’s get clean!”

They both raced through the bemused crowd towards the water and plowed into the gentle surf.

“Mind the children!” Danni shouted.

They disappeared beneath the waves and then circled around, rushing back up onto the beach. The water leapt from their hydrophobic bodies, leaving them pristine, their hair clean, thick, and flowing down their shoulders, just like the rest of the mers on the beach.

“That is a useful trick,” Emma observed. “I wish that happened with human children,” she said with a look at her children.

“Ha, ha, ha,” the triplets replied in near unison.

“Well, is everything working?” Pat asked.

“Of course!” Eric answered. “Peter was a great help too. I’ll bet he’s going to be really useful when you finally get him down in your lab. The man has a great mind, sees things so clearly.”

“I believe the plan is to get HER down in the lab in the next few days,” Michael said.

“Oh, yea, he did mention something about that to Alexis,” Eric said. “Apparently you have to be a girl to be a scientist in this society.”

“James is a scientist,” Debra said proudly. “He is one of the world’s foremost geneticists.”

“Well, that might have been the case, but lately I’ve tried to approach science from an applied point of view, thanks to you all,” James said, indicating Elise and Bridget. “Perhaps after I’ve mastered the fundamental biological structures of mers and what’s possible as medical interventions, I’ll return to my study of genetics. Besides, Galina and Alexis are far ahead of me on morphologies of siren cell DNA.”

“I hate it when they start speaking in a different language,” Eric said.

“Don’t change the subject! What’s wrong with being a girl?” Sally asked.

“Nothing,” Eric protested. “I love girls.”

“You’d better. Now, let’s get back to the lab and try to raise my father,” Sally said. “It’s this morning there.”

“I can never understand how you keep track of times so easily,” Danni said.

“It’s a navy thing,” Sally said.

“It’s a military thing,” Mark said.

“Sorry to ask for this call so early, but it’s an emergency,” Jaclyn explained into the computer.

“It’s fine, but I have to figure out how to get the video working,” Bart Kolbert’s voice said from the computer. “I can hear you just fine, though. What’s the problem? Did you get the shipment? Wait, you’re talking to me over the Internet, of course you got the shipment!”

“Yes, we got everything, thanks! But we can’t raise Jackson Baker or anyone else out east,” Jaclyn explained. “We’ve never had this problem before.”

“Oh, yes, I think I can shed some light there, but it’s not good,” Bart said.

Sally gasped and grabbed Eric’s arm.

“I got an email from Mr. Baker about two days ago, and he said that his home was being raided by security forces, probably from the National Security Agency or the Pentagon,” Bart said.

“Oh, no!” Sally said.

“He didn’t offer any details but explained that he was sealing himself and the four mers in an underground bunker, and that he would send word when he could,” Bart continued. “I’ve not heard from him yet either.”

“The four mers?” Pat asked. “He said four mers? Does that mean that they all finally transitioned? God, wish we could get data from them! Is everyone alright? Did they transition safely?”

“I don’t know,” Bart said. “I’ve literally told you everything I know. I’ve taken steps to prepare myself to be brought in for questioning, but so far, nothing.”

“Well, that’s at least good,” Jaclyn said. “What plans have you made, and what should we be doing on this end?”

“Just a minute,” Bart Kolbert’s voice said from the computer speakers. “I’ll reboot the video.”

The screen flickered and then his image appeared on the screen, he was sitting in his office in San Francisco, the early morning sun just visible in the window behind him.

“We can see you! Can you see me?” Jaclyn asked.

“Not yet … no, wait,” he was obviously trying to fix the settings on his computer. “There!”

Jaclyn smiled as she watched Bart’s face go slack. It took a good ten seconds, and she just smiled and let him gape at her.

“Here, look,” she said, reaching forward to the tiny camera, watching the chat window to make sure the camera was going where she wanted.

She panned the camera down her body, where her hair modestly covered her breasts for the first video chat with her lawyer, down along her green and gold tail with one of her mid-tail-fins flapping, finally to her large flukes, which she curled up in a mermaid wave of “hello.” She turned the camera to Janice, who gave Bart a smile, and then panned across the lab where Eric’s pod waited and then over to the pool, where the rest of the other mers bobbed in the water. She returned the camera to her own face and invited Pat into the view.

“This is Pat,” Jaclyn explained. “You’ve already spoken to her before.”

The two mermaids waited a few more seconds for Bart to recover, and he did, shaking himself and sitting up straight.

“Well,” he said in a girlishly high pitch.

He cleared his throat, stretched his chin forward, and began again.

“Well,” he said in his normal baritone. “I thought I had an idea about what we ought to do, but now I’m not so sure.”

“What was your idea?” Pat asked.

“I thought we’d ask one of the big morning news anchors to fly out and ‘discover’ you guys,” Bart said. “We’d use the world-wide publicity to protect the MMI from being overwhelmed by those who would do us ill, but now I’m not so sure.”

“Why?” Pat asked.

“Because you all are so beautiful,” Bart said, as if he was offering an obviously conclusive argument.

“Why would being beautiful compromise your plan?” Pat asked.

“Anyone who can afford transportation to Mermaid Island will head your way,” Bart said. “I didn’t realize what you guys looked like. When people find out they can become “like” you, it’s all over. People will come from every corner of the globe.”

“Really?” asked Pat.

“Have you been paying attention to anything?” Phoebe asked, exasperated. “For someone who is the smartest person I know, you can be really dumb. Think about it! Eric, Sally, Trevor, Rose … me?” She paused, letting it sink in. “Has anyone turned us down? Harold, your sister, the Connors? Anyone? He’s right, you know. And when word leaks out that you get younger and live longer, billions of people will want to jump in our pool.”

“Oh, god!” Pat said, looking around the room, seeing heads nod. “We’d be loved to death.”

“Something like that,” Bart agreed. “We’re going to have to try to break this story slowly, and with help, and your location will have to be difficult to find. I’ll do everything I can to track down what’s happened to Mr. Baker and the others, and I’ll send you an email, now that you’re fully on-line.”

“Right,” Pat said, still a bit stunned at the new problems the mers faced.

“In the meantime, batten down the hatches. I suggest that you start work on two issues: first, some sort of evacuation and dispersion plan should something go really wrong. You’re too attached to one location, right now, and you’ve got to fix that. Second, develop some sort of security for your facilities there, so people can’t wander in and start changing,” Bart said, pausing to sip some water. “We’re in for a bumpy ride, folks.”

“I’m beginning to see that,” Pat agreed.

“What about Russia?” Galina asked.

“What about Russia,” Pat said.

“We maybe should make more than one connection and try to get big powers to protect us?” Galina said in her Russian accent. “Once key scientific peoples understand The Device, your country, mine, and Xing’s will do all they can to protect us.”

“Up to a point,” Bart said. “They aren’t going to do anything for free, even (or especially) if it is in their own self interest. You’re going to have to be able to offer some carrots along with your big stick.”

“We have carrots,” Galina said. “Lots of carrots.”

“Give me an example,” Bart suggested.

“A sea anemone that eats human and animal waste in boundary waters in bays and estuaries. Sea grasses that make freshwater rivers and lakes cleaner. Algae that absorbs and sequesters pollution, bacteria that treat sewage seven times faster and one hundred times better than traditional methods. A solar-powered, bioengineered water desalination process that is capable of producing enough fresh water for London each day. The ability to speed up the biological carbon pump in the ocean, thus offsetting the rate of carbon release by human activity, and finally, all kinds of medical cures, that for the moment, we can only speculate,” Pat said. “How’s that?”

“Good. Those are some pretty good carrots,” Bart admitted. “I like the scientific angle; it gets the story out of the tabloids and into something everyone can respect. You guys let me know who needs to be contacted in what countries, and I’ll arrange for a video tele-summit. It looks as if the MMI is about to have its first international conference way ahead of schedule.”

“I was hoping we wouldn’t have to go this route,” Jaclyn said. “But I guess I was naive.”

“Maybe someday,” Bart said. “Don’t give up on the dream you outlined in Appendix T. It’s a worthy dream. Keep it.”

“Thanks, Bart,” Jaclyn said. “So, does that mean that are you tempted to join us, especially now that you’ve seen us?”

Bart smiled, expecting the question.

“No,” he said. “But I might have to come for a visit.”

Harold couldn’t help himself, he had to watch, if only for a little while. As the three beautiful women who were destined to become his pod-mates brought one another to repeated, earth shaking orgasms, Harold counted his blessings. His journey started in a small town in Kansas, with abusive and rigid parents, his older sister a hated lesbian, and then he ran away to a life as far away from Kansan as possible, as a merchant marine. He was useful there because he was handy and small, so he could often fix things other crewmembers could not. But that jealousy was probably the reason why for being pushed overboard.

He remembered being sure he was going to die on that soggy container box, and he shivered. Then came the miraculous appearance of these even more miraculous creatures, and now he was about to be joined in a mer marriage to three beautiful young women, each of whom had come to this moment through hell and hardship. Maja’s cry as she reached another orgasm roused him from his reverie. He waited until her yelps subsided before he walked towards them.

“Finally!” Antonia said, turning towards him.

“Somebody pinch me,” Harold said with a grin, his swim trunks taut across his engorged penis.

Valencia tapped her sister wife and the three of them huddled in the pool, their heads pressed together as they whispered. Finally, Antonia stood up.

“Go back to the hut, take off your clothes, lie on the big bed in the main hut, and close your eyes,” she ordered.

“Your wish is my command,” Harold answered, turning smartly on his heel and marching back down the path towards the hut.

Valencia and her sister wives watched their soon-to-be-mate walk away from them. As soon as he was out of sight, they waded out of the pool and let the water evaporate from their bodies, the late afternoon sun warming them. Valencia imitated both Maja and Antonia, pulling her hair from behind her and squeezing the water out with her fist. All three of them then combed their hair with their fingers, trying to get it to dry faster.

“I never had hair this thick before,” Maja said.

“I never had hair that wouldn’t tangle,” Antonia said. “I can’t believe how well behaved mermaid hair actually is.”

“I never had long hair,” Valencia said, running her fingers through the thick, silky strands, enjoying the slight tug on her scalp.

“Just be glad it’s almost mermaid hair, if you were just a regular girl, getting out of hard water, like that rocky pool, would mean that you’d have a tangled mess for hours,” Antonia said.

“Watching you two is getting me horny again,” Maja said.

“I haven’t stopped being horny,” Valencia said. “I can’t believe how good everything feels. My hair, my fingers going through my hair, the weight of my breasts against my chest, the wonderful ache between my legs … God! It all feels so damn good.”

Antonia shook her head, her quickly drying hair now starting to gain body. She looked at Maja and Valencia’s efforts and admired the way their breasts bobbled as they combed their long hair.

“Shake it out, see how dry it is,” she suggested. Both girls did, and Maja marveled at how quickly her hair had dried.

“I think that’s good,” Antonia said. “Pat said there’d be food in the kitchen hut, so let’s go there first. Hang on for a sec.”

Antonia grabbed the relay box, and Maja started down the path, then Antonia, and Valencia brought up the rear. Antonia’s rolling hips riveted Valencia, her full, round globes wobbling as she walked, her slender waist like the top of a pendulum. Valencia looked down at her own hips, noticing that she too had a rolling gait, and she put her hands on her hipbones, watching as each went up and down as she walked. Her breasts swung on her chest too, and she loved the way they bounced slightly as she moved. Soon, they arrived at the huts and saw Harold’s fee through the door to the main hut as they went by.

“Don’t move,” Antonia sang out.

The girls went into the kitchen hut and saw the dried fish, some fruit, and leafy greens that had been left for them. There were also several canteens of water. They gathered the food and brought it into the main hut where Harold lay. Antonia also grabbed an old rag that was nearby and handed it to Maja.

“Don’t move,” Antonia warned, as she placed the relay box on the windowsill while Maja tied the rag on him like a blindfold. “First we eat, and then you eat.”

The girls showered Harold with the food, softly raining down bits and pieces of fresh fruit, greens, and small pieces of fish. When they had exhausted the supply and he was lightly covered with food, they opened a canteen and passed it among them, drinking deeply. Then they eased onto the bed with Harold and began nuzzling his body, eating from his skin.

“Oh, god,” he said. “This is so cool, but why do I have to be blindfolded?”

“It’s part of the experiment,” Antonia said. “Now hush.”

Harold tried to relax, but between the memory of how beautiful the girls looked and the soft caresses of their lips as they ate, and the occasional breast that pressed to his leg or dragged across his arm, he could not.

Valencia noticed Harold having a smell she never noticed before, not in anyone. Of course, she reminded herself, she hadn’t ever put her nose this close to a man before. The smell was salty and musky, like the earth of the jungle floor after rain. The smell intensified the closer she drew to his crotch where his erection throbbed on his stomach. Her face unexpectedly pressed into Maja’s as they both went after the same morsel of fish just north of his penis on his belly. Maja won the morsel, and Valencia paused to smell her. Her sister-wife smelled lighter, spicier, less musky, and she was glad when she felt her body react to that smell too.

“That was wonderful,” Antonia said as they finished. “Now, we’re going to feed you, and we’ll have a bit of dessert while you try to figure out who is doing what to you. No peeking from under the blindfold and don’t move a muscle.”

“Promise,” Harold said, his eyes shut, his arms at his side.

Antonia got on all fours and positioned her breasts over Harold’s face. “Drink,” she said, pressing her nipple into his mouth.

As Harold began to feed, Maja began kissing his feet, working her way up his legs. Valencia started on his pecs, lavishing attention on his nipples and working her way down his torso. By the time they both reached his cock, Antonia switched breasts. Harold moaned into her breast when Maja slowly slid her lips over his cock, giving him several good strokes. She then lifted her head and presented his cock to Valencia.

She leaned down, giving it a kiss, wondering what would her father think of her now? She licked the tip and then slid her lips down around the crown, flicking her tongue across the top. Harold moaned appreciatively. She gave a few quick, hard strokes with her lips too, and then switched places with Antonia.

As Harold’s lips found her stiff nipple, a flood of hormones washed through her body. Her milk let down, and her other nipple dripped milk on to Harold’s neck. Valencia couldn’t keep silent, despite their plan, and sighed with contentment, wishing she could lift Harold’s head into her lap and feed him like that for hours. Antonia and Maja continued to caress and suck on his cock as he fed.

When he finished with Valencia, Maja took her place, and Antonia indicated that she should straddle his waist. Valencia smiled, ready for this last barrier to her womanhood to be broken. She lifted herself over him as Antonia held his cock upright. She reached down and pulled back her labia, aiming her new opening at the top of his cock while Antonia held his cock steady. A spasm jerked her hips as the excitement of what she was about to do erupted across her abdomen. She steadied herself, and then slowly lowered herself down onto his cock.

The maidenhead she was expecting never materialized, and she slid down his cock in one, smooth motion. She fought the urge to vocalize and savored the incredible and alien experience of being stretched open and filled with a foreign object. When she bottomed out, she looked quizzically at her sister-wives. Antonia shrugged in return and indicated she should get on with it. Valencia chafed at the no moaning restriction imposed by Antonia’s little game, but she complied.

Careful not to dislodge Maja, who was nearly done breastfeeding, Valencia slowly raised and lowered herself on Harold’s cock, rolling her hips as she bottomed out on each stroke, forcing her clit to rub on Harold’s pubic bone. She couldn’t help gasping as she did, and Antonia solved that problem by grabbing Harold’s hand and stuffing it into her crotch, causing her to gasp too. When Maja finished, she grabbed the other hand, and soon all three girls were gasping and cooing.

Harold was in heaven. Between the power of the mermaid milk coursing through his body, strengthening and energizing him, and the erotic gyrations of his three soon-to-be-pod-mates, he felt like he could go on forever. His hopes were dashed, however, as the erotic energy began to build, each of his girls thundering towards their first orgasms with him. He had no idea who was who, and didn’t feel the need to try to figure it out. He just enjoyed the wonderful tension building in his balls as the three girls stroked, jerked, gasped, and moaned their way towards their orgasms.

The two girls he was furiously fingering both erupted first, and he felt the warm spray of milk rain down upon him. His cock stiffened further as his own orgasm rushed forward, and he erupted into whoever was on top of him just as her hips ground out an orgasm on his cock, moving in quick, sharp, circles with accompanying grunts. He kept his eyes closed as each girl disentangled herself from him, and then after a moment he heard a voice.

“You can open them now,” Antonia said.

Harold pulled off his blindfold and opened his eyes, blinking. He raised his head and saw all three girls, their arms locked around each other, standing at the foot of the bed. All three shared a freshly fucked glow, their smiles wide and relaxed.

“Which one of us did what?” Antonia asked.

“I have no idea,” Harold answered. “Really, it was impossible to tell, especially since I’ve never even touched any of you before. Why did we play that particular game?”

“Pat wants to find out when the earliest bonding happens,” Antonia explained. “How soon your mer organs begin to form and when they might come on line. So, you have to try to sense which of us is doing what based on your bonds rather than your eyes.”

“Oh,” Harold said. “So, we’re going to do this again?”

“Probably several more times,” Antonia said.

“Perfect,” Harold said, pulling his hands up under his head and crossing his feet. “You just let me know when you’re ready.”

“Close your eyes,” Maja said, breaking free of her sisterly embrace and coming around the bed.

Harold snapped his eyes shut, tied the blindfold back on, and threw his arms back down at his sides, and thanks to the siren cells already at work in his body, his cock immediately showed signs of new life.

“So, what are you going to do with The Johanna?” Liz asked, getting ready to depart the boat for the last time.

Michael Thompson looked over the boat named for his deceased wife, thinking about the plans he had made for this moment. He smiled at Liz, wondering for the umpteenth time what she would look like restored to health, youth, and her legs. She was a handsome and strong willed woman, and Michael realized that she would likely exert far more influence in his pod than he first imagined. No matter, a strong woman was never a problem, he reminded himself, thinking back to Johanna herself. No, the only problem was an unreasonable woman.

He glanced back inside the boat to where Peter and Leonard were preparing to leave the boat for the last time. The Johanna was an empty shell. They had scavenged most of the equipment and furniture. The electronic equipment was mostly up at the mountainside huts, giving any humans who might stay there radio access to the caves below them. The beds too were now up at the huts, and the rest of the equipment and materials were in the caves for further re-adaptation into mer useful items. They even removed the engine, broke it down into parts, and carted the remains up to the mountainside huts for further reuse.

“We’re going to tow her to the far side of the shelf, along the southeastern edge of the island, and sink her in about 10 meters of water,” he explained. “She’ll be an artificial reef and perhaps a refuge for us when the Moon Pool gets to be crowded.”

“Won’t that be a bit like a mausoleum?” she asked.

“Depends on your point of view,” Michael said. “My wife’s ashes were spread over the ocean, but that was outside Hong Kong, and I named her so that our sons would have something tangible representing their mother that kept them safe and afloat.”

“Now why am I finding out what a sensitive and nice man you are at this late date?” she asked with a smile.

“Business is business,” he said with a laugh.

“I’ll keep that in mind when we seek refuge in this empty boat,” Liz said.

“Well, we really won’t need much once we’re mers,” Michael said. “We’ll just float in the stateroom. Furniture would just get in the way.”

“Yea, I suppose you’re right,” Liz said. “We’ll have air bladders and much more besides, won’t we?”

“Yes,” Michael said. “You looking forward to it?”

“Absolutely,” Liz declared. “I can’t wait to be free of this chair, and I have to admit that the mers are beautiful, graceful people. Who wouldn’t want to join them?”

“I suppose there are many,” Michael said. “But I’m not terribly interested in knowing any of those people. What do you think about our assignment?”

“Well, I didn’t have any preconceived notions of how I was going to change or bond or whatever these mers do,” Liz said, brushing back a strand of gray hair that had broken free. “And I’ve valued any independence I can get, so being alone for the first stage of feedings is fine by me. It might be hard on Peter and Leonard.”

“Why do you think so?” Michael asked.

“Well, Valencia needed the extra push from the other girls to start a Type II chain reaction,” Liz said. “Peter is pretty eager to get started towards being the girl that he’s imagined since puberty. So, if he can’t do it on his own, he’ll have to wait until the second day.”

“And Len?” Michael asked.

“I understand the need for keeping him in the dark,” Liz said. “But I can’t gage how invested Len is on the surrender aspect. I feel like my role in this experiment is a little bit like that girl in high school, the one who is nice to the nerd so that he can be publicly humiliated.”

“I guess I can see that,” Michael admitted. “But I have to admit that I kind of like it; it has a certain kink, you know?”

“I never thought I’d admit this to another man, usually it’s a girltalk -thing, but you’re right, it does have a certain kink to it,” Liz admitted. “Now Michael, I really don’t want to be this old crippled lady any longer, so if you could please help me into the water, we can start on our journey.”

She lifted her hands up and put them around his neck as he picked her up. She rested her head against his shoulder as he walked over the back railing and stepped down to the aft swimming deck. He set her down so that she sat facing the beach with her withered and useless legs in the water. She gave him a quick peck on the cheek.

“Next time I see you I’ll be a lot prettier, and I’ll give you a much better kiss,” she said.

“I’ll count the days,” he said.

She slipped off the deck and into the arms of Trixi, who guided her onto her back. Mark’s pod was going to be feeding and tending to her for the next eighteen hours. He watched as they made their way across the northeast arm of the lagoon towards the new shelter they had erected there. Liz’s gray head was visible as she hung onto Trixi’s shoulders.

“All set?” Peter asked as he stepped down onto the swimming deck.

“Nearly,” Michael said. “Captain always leaves last, you know.”

“Right, of course,” Peter said. “Well, I hope to be a lot different the next time we meet!”

“Me too,” Michael said with a grin. “I think you’re a great guy and all, but I don’t think you’d make a good pod-mate in your current state.”

Peter scanned the beach until he spotted Eric’s pod. Sally was making her way to the boat while the rest of her pod waited in the shallow surf. “There’s my ride,” he said as he stepped off into the water. “It’s going to be lovely to be young again.”

“You’re going to be lovely,” Michael said. “I can’t wait to see how you turn out.”

“I hope you like my surprise,” Peter said. “See you tomorrow!”

Michael saluted as Sally collected Peter and they started back for the main beach where Peter would begin his transition. Peter would be having mother’s milk from Liga and Alexis to gain as much power as possible for his effort to go female completely solo. Michael turned and watched as Leonard made his way towards the aft deck, fumbling with briefcase.

“Whatcha got there?” Michael asked.

“Notes, scribblings, stuff,” Len said. “Who knows, someday I might have to start writing legal stuff down. I wanted to start my own record of how things go, how they operate around here. Maybe it will be useful someday.”

“Lucy the Mermaid Scribe,” Michael said.

“Yea, I guess so,” Len said with an awkward smile. He started. “Did you just name me?”

“I believe I did,” Michael said. “What do you think?”

“Um … the book, right?” Len said.

“Yes, the children’s book,” Michael said. “A fitting name for a scribe, one that comes from a book?”

“Sure,” Len said. “I sure wish I knew more about what was happening here. I seem to be the only one who doesn’t know exactly what’s going to happen and when.”

“I know,” Michael said in a comforting manner. “It’s part of the experiment. It can’t be helped. You’ll be fine.”

“Yea, but I really wanted to end up looking like …” he said.

“Kelly Brook,” Michael interrupted. “Yes, I know. Don’t worry, it will work out. We will be together, after all, when we transition to mers. We can tweak you then if necessary.”

“Right, I guess so,” Len said, feeling unsure.

“Look, there’s Tuo’s pod,” Michael said, pointing to the approaching mers. “I’ll see you late tomorrow.”

“Well, that’s a timeline at least,” said Len with a smile.

“Ready?” Eve asked.

“Sure,” Len said. “Um, can one of you take this in and keep it dry?”

“No problem,” Sandi said, rising on her tail, her impressive body on display as she took the briefcase and sank back into the water, holding the slim case aloft.

Len watched as the beautiful mermaid rose up before him, her body a perfect mixture of allure, mystery, and beauty. That used to be a man, Len thought to himself. I’m going to change like that. Holy shit.

“Len?” Michael asked, seeing him mesmerized.

“Right, sorry,” said Len as he slipped into the water, and held onto Eve’s shoulders, her beautiful body moving beneath him.

Michael watched as that pod headed for the southeast side of the lagoon to a shelter also newly built for this experiment. He sat down on his boat, alone, and waited. The boat was to be his solitary outpost, and soon several mermaids, each alone, would visit him to insure that he youthened without the influence of any others. It was going to be a long eighteen hours, he thought to himself, but he had come this far and waited this long.

Leonard Simon tried to shake the feeling that Tuo was watching him, but it was difficult. The stern, silent merman intimidated him, and even though he was out in the lagoon with the rest of his pod, Len still worried.

“I won’t bite,” Sandi said, misinterpreting Len’s hesitation. “You’re supposed to get started tonight.”

“Yes, well, er … yes,” said Len looking over at the beautiful mermaid who was to be his first feeder.

Sandi’s effortless sexuality unnerved him. She was blond, perky, and built like a proverbial brickshithouse, and that was exactly the type of woman that threw him. Well, any gorgeous woman could do it, but blond and perky was more than enough at the moment. His eyes shifted back to the lagoon, searching for any sign of the rest of Sandi’s pod.

“Oh, has Tuo got you worried?” Sandi said, her voice peeling like a silver bell. “Oh, my, that’s funny. Don’t worry; he is like that with everyone. Trust me; he’s not jealous or anything. Besides, this is how mermaids work. You’ll understand in a few days.”

“He didn’t say two words to me,” Len said.

“Sometimes, that’s a good thing,” Sandi said, lifting her hair over her shoulder, exposing one of her perfect breasts. “Now, come on over here and get your medicine, like a good boy.”

“Why is it that beautiful women always seem to infantilize men?” Leonard asked more to himself than as a serious question to the mermaid sitting on the beach waiting for him.

“Because you all like it that way,” Sandi said, laughing. “I should know. I used to be one myself. According to my sister-wife, Dawn, the men who aren’t easily transformed into little boys within the first ten seconds of meeting a girl aren’t worth spit. They tend to be arrogant assholes. What’s worse, when they finally get you in bed, they are littler little boys than the rest of them combined. They’re like two year olds, only worse. Two year olds grow up, eventually.” She laughed.

Len laughed too, remembering some of the bigger assholes he knew when he was young. That seemed to do the trick, and the tension he felt evaporated. He walked over to her and knelt down beside her.

“What should I do?” he asked, feeling awkward.

“Just turn around and put your head in my lap, that’s easiest,” she said.

“Won’t that put me in a subordinate position to you?” he asked.

“All that talk of hormones and submission got you worried?” she asked. He just blushed. “Well, that purple pill you swallowed will tell us more, but Pat’s pretty sure that bonded sets of mermaids are not able to inadvertently bond new mates. Now, if I happened to be part of a pod with one open slot for a mermaid, that would be a different story. You’re just going to go through stage one, nice and easy, just with the girls from our pod.”

“And then after that?” Len asked, trying to pump her for more information.

“You’ll have to wait and see,” She said.

“It’s part of the experiment,” they said in unison.

“Yeah, I know,” said Len. “You can’t blame a guy for trying.”

“No, I suppose not,” Sandi agreed. “Now will you flip over? This is my first time feeding and I’ve been looking forward to it. It’s supposed to be different from just making love to your pod-mates, but no one can seem to describe it for me.”

“I suppose that feeding me will be really different once you decide to have a mermaid of your own,” Len said, thinking about that possibility for himself.

“Well, I won’t be able to compare the experiences if I don’t have this one!” She said, smiling but insistent. “Now, will you please flip over?”

He began to turn, and then hesitated.

“What’s it like?” he asked, looking down her body.

“Mer or girl?” Sandi asked, her mer senses telling her what Len was feeling.

“Both,” Len asked. “I know how you and Tuo started, which is one reason for the experiments with Peter and I, but … I still wonder if I’m making …” he said.

“The right decision?” she finished. “Well, you’re going into this knowing you’ll end up female. I didn’t. But, I have to say that three months later, almost to the day, I can hardly remember being a guy.”

“So, it’s good?” Len asked.

“It’s more than good,” Sandi said, a shiver running through her body. “It’s amazing to feel someone else inside you, and I mean that both physically, like when Tuo has me speared like a tuna on a trident, and emotionally, when I can feel Eve and Dawn’s love inside my own body, my connection to them is glowing with energy.”

Sandi’s eyes seemed to become wider as she spoke, her passion and her love for her mates opening up her innermost self for viewing. Len labored to restrain himself, every fiber in his body wanting to take this beautiful creature into his arms, thrusting into her, making her his own. Sandi sensed his rising passion and took a few deep breaths of her own.

“You’ll get the love you desire, just not from me,” she said playfully. “So, just calm your jets, big boy, or we’re not going to get anywhere tonight.”

Len realized what he was thinking and shook his head.

“Sorry, I just couldn’t seem to help it,” he said. “Help me understand why I need to be a mermaid and not a merman.”

“You don’t need to be anything,” Sandi said. “But if you want to be a mermaid, I can tell you that it’s an incredible experience. Not only did I get to keep the love of a woman I adore and love, but also got to have the love and protection of a strong and powerful mate who can make me feel things that I never thought possible. I didn’t have a choice at first, but now I’m pretty sure that it’s the best of both worlds.”

“Would you choose to do it now, if you could go back?” he asked.

“Life never lets us do that, so it’s not a fair question,” Sandi said. “However, going forward I choose to stay as I am, which is saying something. I could change back, you know, if something happened to Tuo.”

“If something did, would you choose to do so, go back to being male?” Len asked.

“No,” Sandi said, looking over her own body. “I’d stay me, and Eve, Dawn and I would find a new mate, or maybe Eve would become a merman. I don’t know, but I know that Dawn and I would stay just the way we are, twin girls and mates.”

Len thought about that, and wondered what it would be like to be with a young and beautiful Liz or whatever Peter was going to turn out to be. If he was going to look like Kelly Brook, he bet that Liz was going to be more slender and long. She had an air of Lauren Bacall about her, handsome in her later years. Peter had never talked about it, and so Len didn’t know.

“So, shall we get started then?” Sandi asked.

Len nodded and turned his body perpendicular to her and lay back, resting his head on her lap. The texture of her mermaid skin was impossibly soft and smooth, a feature he could feel even with his neck. He looked away from her face and along her tail, feeling her incredibly smooth skin with his cheek. She flicked her flukes up so he could see them, her pale blue and pink tail with yellow highlights shot throughout sparkled in the rays of late evening sunset. He turned back as she reached forward to cradle his head in her arms.

Sandi’s sparkling green eyes smiled down at him, her thick, blond hair falling forward a little as she bent forward. Her large breasts loomed over his face, nearly blocking his view of her eyes, and as he watched, her left breast, the one she was aiming at his face, began to leak milk from the nipple. She brought his head towards her breast, and he instinctively opened his mouth as her stiff nipple touched his lips.

The milk tasted so sweet, so amazingly sweet. He thought it might taste like baby formula, and while mermaid milk was thicker than water, it was surprisingly smooth too, like a warm milkshake. He found himself sucking on this perfect breast before he even realized what he was doing. Sandi was making low, humming noises, almost like a sigh of contentment, and her bulging breast pressed into his face, her milk filling his mouth. He idly thought that “this was it; there was no turning back,” but the sensuousness of what he was doing instantly overwhelmed that small flicker of fear.

He was tempted to reach around her, to embrace her as he suckled, but the thought of Tuo kept his arms across his stomach. After several minutes of feeding, she lifted her left breast from his mouth and lowered the other onto his face.

“My, you’re a fast feeder,” she said.

Len was tempted to say something, but he couldn’t form the words around the right breast that was stuffed into his mouth. He sucked and drank for another five minutes, finally draining her.

“That was really nice,” she admitted. “I can see why the others like doing it. How do you feel?”

Len sat up reluctantly, wishing he could remain attached to those wondrous globes for eternity. He took stock of himself, gave his extremities a quick survey, and looked back at Sandi.

“Fine, I guess,” he said.

“Well, it’s quick but it’s not instantaneous,” she said. “Dawn will be back for your bedtime snack in a few hours, and we’ll see how you’re doing then. You take care, now, O.K.”

Len nodded.

“Good,” she said, swinging her tail away from Len and putting it behind her. She raised herself up on her fins and salamandered back into the water with a backward wave before she ducked under the surface.

Len looked down at his belly, knowing it was full of mermaid milk. It was also just plain full: big, full, and round. He patted his belly like an old friend and wondered how long before the mermaid milk would “heal” him back to his twenties. He looked forward to being in shape again, and he wondered, again, what it would be like to be as powerfully beautiful as his ideal, as Kelly Brook.

He shook his head. Right now, his body was a long, long, way from that ideal.

“Are your systems fully restored and functional?” Susan Perilli asked, as her emergency technical assistance team finished packing up their equipment.

Jackson Baker nodded, watching the last of the technicians get back onto the boat. They had spent most of the day sweeping the island and restoring his confiscated equipment. Now that everything was up and running, Jackson had activated a series of electronic curtains that restored his privacy, other than the technicians whom he didn’t know and didn’t trust. As the boat pulled away from the dock, he turned to his old boss.

“It’s safe now. We can talk freely,” he said. “Between your guys and my stuff the island is clean.”

“Good. I’m sorry you had to be put to all this trouble, Jack,” she said. “If they had just called me, we could have saved the government a lot of time and money.”

“I’m glad I still have your trust,” Jack said, smiling. “I’m about to see how much trust I can put into you.”

“Jack, you’re the most boring person I know,” Susan laughed. “I know everything about you from the time you were five, and there’s not a thing you could tell me that would require you to trust me.”

“It’s about time that I surprised you,” Jack said.

“It’s not going to make me unhappy, will it?” she asked, scanning the horizon. “You know how I hate to bend rules. I’ve never broken my oath, and I don’t plan on starting now. If I shouldn’t know what you’re about to tell me, don’t.”

“I’ve always admired your strength of character,” Jack said. “It’s the only reason those crazy hackers actually work for the government. They trust you. I trust you. Others will eventually know what I’m about to share with you, but it will have to be on a need-to-know basis. I wanted you to be the first, and besides Mac wanted you.”

“Mac?” she asked, the name tugging at her memory. Her brow furrowed as she tried to pull it up. “You don’t mean Admiral Mackenzie Bennett, do you?”

“You know him?” Jack asked, surprised.

“No, I never knew him. We got asked to do some checking a few months back,” she explained. “To make sure his sudden retirement wasn’t linked to any sensitive or problematic issues.”

“Mac?” Jackson asked, stunned. “Investigated? He’s a decorated veteran of three wars!”

“We check on anyone who has top secret clearance and radically changes their life,” she said. “He was fine, just smitten with one of our own alumni. That actually happens a lot.”

“What, admirals sneaking off with former field operatives?” Jack asked.

“No, people drastically changing their lives because they finally fall in love with someone,” Susan said wistfully.

“Oh,” Jack said, noticing her tone. He was in the same boat … never really fell in love with anyone, but that was about to change, he thought.

“Hey now, how did you know it was a field operative?” Susan asked.

“Joy Simpson is the field agent who he ran off with, right?” he said.

"And how do you know Ms. Simpson?” she asked.

“Well, you’re going to meet them,” Jack said. “Love has really changed both of them, quite a bit, so get yourself ready.” He started walking up towards the house where Kyle was waiting outside the door.

“They’re here?” Susan asked, suddenly suspicious. “On this island?”

“Relax,” Jack said, stopping. “The raid has nothing to do with them, per se. I think it was triggered because of my transfer of assets to the Marine Mammals Institute, incorporated in San Francisco but with a major holding in Kiribati. There’s a Blackgate protocol nearby in the South Pacific, and so a computer program, not an investigation initially triggered the raid. Some cowboy wanting to make a name for himself probably made it official.”

“Well, you’re right about the cowboy,” Susan said, thinking about the ass-chewing she helped deliver a few hours earlier. “But how did you know about the Blackgate?”

“Mac knew about it,” Jack said. “His daughter set it. Didn’t you also investigate her? She retired suddenly.”

“She was only a junior grade naval officer, wasn’t she?” Susan said, remembering the admiral’s file. “That’s not high enough for an automatic investigation and she probably didn’t have the same level of clearance as her father. How is she connected to all of this?”

“You’ll understand when you see Mac and Joy,” he said.

“You’re not about to show me something that puts me in an illegal or unethical position, are you?” she asked.

“No, I’m not,” Jack said. “There’s nothing illegal or unethical about this whole thing. It’s just unbelievable. Come on, I trusted you.”

Susan gave him her “look” and he held her gaze. Normally, that look wilted lesser men, but she decided to trust Jackson and besides, she was enormously curious to see the innermost sanctum of her notoriously private former employee. He turned and headed for the house, and she followed.

“Are you sure this is the right wavelength?” Alexis asked, hunched over the radio with her Russian former colleague.

“Da,” Galina answered.

“You know, you get more Russian when you think about your homeland,” Petra said. “I’ve noticed that your accent gets thicker sometimes.”

“That’s actually a common occurrence across many cultures,” Pat said. “Most people unconsciously adopt the vocal rhythms and inflections of the local language even if they can’t understand a single word. The same thing happens when we think of a place, especially if it’s where we grew up.”

“Everything is a lesson,” Phoebe said, rolling her eyes.

“Pipe down, you,” Pat said affectionately.

"????????????. ??? ??????? ????, ??????? ??????? ???????????????" a voice crackled over the radio.

“Hush now,” Galina said to her fellow mers.

Continuing in Russian, Galina said, “Hello Science Base One, this is Grisha Permyakov, survivor of number six six seven ??????? (Dolphin class sub). I am here with Alexander Kolomnikov.”

There was a long silence.

“Please identify the mission further,” the voice requested.

“D-667-S was lost near 3 20’ 2" south by 170 20’ 12" west thirteen months ago,” Galina continued. “We are the only surviving crew. We were in an extravehicular craft on a scientific mission when a hull breach destroyed the 667. We were saved by locals without access to telecommunications, but have finally secured this radio. We need to speak with Chief Scientist Desisov, Director of the Primorsky Scientific Center, Vladivostok.”

There was a pause, and fifteen minutes passed. The mers grew anxious.

“Comrades, you are alive!” a new voice answered, still in Russian. “We thought all hands had been lost on D-667-S. What is your status?”

“Whom am I speaking with?” Galina asked.

“This is Director Yelchukov!” the voice answered.

“Anatoly!” Galina said with a squeal. “You got promoted!”

“Is this Grisha? You don’t sound like Grisha Permyakov,” Anatoly said warily.

“Anatoly, I know I sound different, but such a thing would a year on a small atoll do to a man,” Galina said. “But what has happened to Sergei Desisov?”

“He became ill after your accident and died,” Anatoly said. “Cancer was the official diagnosis but heartbreak is mine.”

“I am so sorry for the Center, he was a good man,” Galina said.

“Is this really Grisha?” Anatoly said.

“You are still the proud papa of your Laika’s, Pavel and Nikoli?” she asked.

“Yes, Pavel still hunts with me,” Anatoly said. “Nikoli is too old now. He has retired.”

“Getting his belly scratched and being fed too much by your lovely wife, Yaroslava, eh?” Galina laughed, thinking of Anatoly’s dogs.

“You sound like you know me, but you do not sound like Grisha, my friend,” Anatoly said. “You sound like a girl.”

“It is hard to believe, but I am still me, but you are right; I have changed,” Galina admitted. “The transformation is remarkable, and you will hardly believe it when you see me.”

“Where are you? How will I see you?” Anatoly asked.

“Can you get access to such a thing as Skype?” Galina asked.

“Yes,” Anatoly answered. “You have access to the Internet on your atoll?”

“Just recently,” Galina admitted. “Give me your Skype name and an American working with the Marine Mammals Institute, an international scientific organization where I now work, will contact you shortly. When you are in a more secure location, we can tell you more.”

“You’re not going to get me in trouble, are you my strange sounding friend?” Anatoly asked.

“No, no,” Galina said. “I’m going to make you famous, the most famous Russian scientist the
world has known!”

“I have much patience and skepticism, my friend. My username is anatoly.yelchukov,” he said.

“How very much like a scientist,” Galina said. “So plain.”

“Who will be calling me?” Anatoly asked.

“His name is Kolbert,” she said. “He is the chief financial officer of the MMI.”

“But this is a miracle! You’re alive,” Anatoly said. “Should I contact your family? What of Alexander?”

“No, no,” Galina said. “There is still much to share with you, and we cannot yet share it with others. Please do not notify anyone. You will understand shortly. Can I have your promise?”

“I can promise you silence for a few days, but I cannot keep this to myself for long,” Anatoly explained. “I would place myself in a difficult position.”

“I understand,” Galina said. “A few days will have to do. More later, our conversation is unsecure.”

“????????? ??? ? ?? ????????,” came the final reply.

“Well, that’s done it,” Galina said, turning off the radio. “We have to get everything else going now.”

“Right,” Pat said. “Phoebe, see if you can raise Jackson Baker on Skype.” Phoebe scurried over to the main computer at the front of the lab to begin that process.

“Bart has the list of American and European scientists, and you think Anatoly can assemble the Russians?” Pat asked.

“Yes,” Galina answered. “He is both smart and unafraid, a great scientist. He will understand our schematics very well.”

“We’ve got them!” Phoebe said.

“Alexis, can you go switch with Sally so she can talk to her father?” Pat asked.

Alexis leapt from her spot several meters back from the pool and arced over Phoebe’s head into the water. Alexis shot down the tunnel like a bolt of lightning.

“I can’t believe she’s pregnant,” Pat said, awed by her physical display.

“Wait until Anatoly sees that,” Galina said with a smirk. “They used to play squash together.”

They both shambled in between tables and equipment until they reached Phoebe’s side. There on the computer screen was Jackson, looking fine.

“Mr. Baker, good to see you,” Pat said.

“Glad we don’t have to use the short wave?” he asked.

“Glad to put faces to names,” Pat said. “Neither medium was secure, but there’s more chatter on the internet, and so I think we’re better off here.”

“Train station security,” Jack said. “If you want a private conversation, go to a busy public space.”

“Exactly,” Pat said. “What’s the status of everyone?”

“Well, I’ve got a new laptop that I’ve taken down to my tank, so I’ll just show you,” he said, lifting up the computer and turning it around.

Pat watched as Mac, Joy, Annette and Bonnie waved to her from the top of the tank, and then they let go of the wall and slid into the water. Pat, Phoebe, and Galina all gasped when the four mers snapped out of view. A few seconds later, they reappeared at the top of the tank. Jack turned the computer back around.

“What the hell was that?” Pat demanded.

“It’s a long story,” Jack said. “But before I get started, I want to introduce you to a few others.”

He looked away from the camera and urged someone to come into the view. A male and female face both looked over his shoulder.

“This here is Kyle Johnson, an old family friend of mine since childhood,” Jack said, and Kyle nodded. “And this is my former boss at the CIA, Susan Perilli. That is Pat McDonnell, the mermaid who started everything.”

“CIA?” Pat squeaked.

“Don’t worry,” Jack said smiling.

“Yea, don’t worry,” Mac’s voice boomed from off camera. “She knows as much as we can tell her and she’s on board. Where’s my daughter?”

“Coming,” said Phoebe. “She’s helping … never mind, she’ll be here shortly and she can tell you all about it.”

“Mr. Baker?” Pat said. “Can you please let me know what’s going on there?”

“First, it’s just Jack, and second, where do you want me to start?” he asked.

“Start with carrying us both up the dock, unconscious, with Annette and Brent,” Mac said.

“It’s Bonnie, thank you very much,” her voice said from off camera.

“Wasn’t then,” Mac said. “Jack, are you going to get started or do we have to wait all day?”

“Right,” Jack said. “So, they got here two weeks ago,” he began.

“This is NOT fun,” Maja complained as she pressed down into the soft, brown material on the ground before her.

“Those sensors are expensive,” Antonia explained. “Be careful, don’t press too hard.”

“But it smells,” Maja whined. “Can’t you do this?”

“I’m already doing my own,” Antonia said with a sigh. “This is the last time you’ll have to do it.”

“I can’t believe that Harry and Val found theirs this morning,” Maja groused.

“Ah, found it,” Antonia exclaimed, holding aloft her finger, a small purple capsule sticking to the tip.

She took a small plastic bag and put the capsule inside, sealing it with a flourish. She walked over to where Maja was bending over a small brown pile on the jungle floor. She peered over her shoulder.

“It’s right there,” Antonia pointed.

“Oh, yes, there it is,” Maja said, pressing her own finger on to the small pill and lifting it up. She put it into another plastic bag, and Antonia sealed it for her.

“Let’s wash our hands and get to the pool,” Maja said. “Val and Harry have been there for twenty minutes already.”

“Are you jealous?” Antonia asked.

“No,” Maja said honestly. “Just horny.”

“You’re insatiable,” Antonia agreed, giving her a peck on the cheek. “But adorable. I’ll put these in the beach bag while you wash up first.”

They hurried back to the huts and washed up. Then they both dashed up the path towards the rocky pool, laughing as they raced along. When they got to the pool they both stopped at the edge of the jungle and took in the view before them.

Valencia stood in the pool facing the morning sun, her long hair flowing over her shoulders and back. Her hands were on the edge of the rocky pool, and her legs spread wide, braced against the bottom of the pool. Harold stood behind her, his hands on her hips, his hips slapping into hers as he drove himself into her. Val’s breasts shook back and forth and Harold grunted with each thrust. Both Maja and Antonia watched as Val reached her climax, her legs collapsing under her.

“That was sooooo good,” Val said as she turned around and leaned against the edge of the tub. “I can’t believe how you can just keep going and going and going,” she told him.

“Neither can I,” Harold admitted. “But I’m glad you like it.”

“I love it,” Valencia said, reaching out to stroke his still stiff penis.

“I can’t believe that I came seven times last night,” Harold said, admiring Val’s jostling breasts as she stroked his cock with one hand.

“Hey lovers,” Val called out, seeing her pod-mates at the edge of the jungle. “Come on in, the water is amazing.”

“Everything come out O.K.?” Harold asked, over his shoulder.

“Men are such little boys,” Maja said. “Girls do not speak of such things.”

“Everything is fine and everybody’s ready to go,” Antonia said, smiling.

“How soon do we have to be down to the beach?” Val asked.

Harold looked up at the sun, “Not for at least another hour or so. Do you want to go down early?”

Valencia held up her hand, showing off her webbing. “I don’t want to start changing by accident.”

“Don’t worry, there has to be at least one other person with mer organs to trigger the siren cells into Stage III,” Antonia said. “Didn’t you listen yesterday to Pat’s explanations?”

“She got so technical,” Valencia said. “And besides, I was nervous about changing into a girl.”

“Well, you can relax,” Antonia said, stepping into the pool. “You can’t change by accident. First you have to have a superabundance of siren cells, so you have to drink a lot of milk, and second, another person with mer organs needs to trigger the cascade.”

“Yea, besides, I want at least one more time with Harry before we change,” Maja said, sliding next to her new mate, taking his still stiff cock from Valencia’s hand. “Do me from behind, just like you did Val,” she said, positioning herself in front of Val, pressing her breasts into her sister wife’s.

Harold quickly positioned himself behind Maja and slipped his cock inside her. She cooed as it went in and leaned into Valencia, kissing her.

“Do … you … think … we’ll … miss … it … like … this?” Maja asked as Harold thrust in and out from her petite body.

“There are positions you can only do as a mermaid,” Antonia said. “I’m sure we’ll think of new positions to replace this one.”

“Liz?” Trixi called out as she salamandered towards her hut. “Are you alright?”

“I’m alive,” Liz’s voice came from within the hut.

“Homa, Binah, and I are here for your next feeding,” Trixi continued. “Can we come in?”

“No,” she said. “I’ll come out.”

Trixi raised her eyebrows at her sister-wife as they both settled onto the sand. After a few seconds, Liz Wainwright emerged from her hut, walking carefully on her own two legs.

“I’m walking,” she said, mostly to herself. “I’m finally, fucking walking!” she said, louder, celebrating.

“So, is it worth it?” Trixi asked.

“Last night?” Liz said. “Sorry I acted like such a baby, but I’ve never felt pain like that before. I know that Dawn explained how much healing her cancer had hurt, but I have to believe that regenerating spinal cords take the pain prize.”

“Actually, it might,” Trixi said. “Pat wished we had thought of some sort of pain medicine for you. And don’t apologize; you were very brave, and everyone could see how much pain you were in.”

“Yea,” Liz said. “You guys really called in the entire ambulance squad last night. Who saw me like that? I can hardly remember anything but the pain.”

“James and his pod all tried to help,” Trixi said. “And all the scientists also had a look at you. It was quite a crowd.”

“God, I’m going to have to crawl in a hole,” Liz said, shaking her long hair in front of her face.

“No you won’t,” Homa said firmly. “You were brave, you were allowed to scream. It was terrible to hear, but it was the scream of victory.”

“I am sorry for your pain,” Binah said, shifting on her fins. “Trixi explained to me that I did not hurt you.”

“No, you were just the mermaid I was feeding from when the healing on my spine started,” Liz said. “I’m sorry I embarrassed you.”

“You did not embarrass me,” Binah said, squaring her shoulders. “You frightened me. I was scared I had hurt you. It was my first time feeding.”

“Well, we can put it all behind us now,” Trixi said. “Liz, don’t hide your face, honey, it’s alright and you’re looking beautiful.”

“Well, thank you, Trixi,” Liz said, straightening up, pulling her more youthful hair back from her face. “The good news is that I feel tons better this morning. How do I look?”

“You look amazing,” Trixi said. “I don’t think you’ll need to spend much time in the hot tub for further cooking. You’re nearly there already. In fact, you remind me of a movie star I saw once, but I can’t remember her name.”

“Catherine Deneuve?” Liz asked, brushing her now blond hair back from her face.

“Yes, that’s her!” Trixi said.

“Yea, I got that a lot forty years ago,” she admitted. “I used to hate it, but if I had to resemble someone, she’s a classy actress. I could do worse.”

“So, last feeding?” Trixi asked.

“Sure,” Liz said. “And then you’re ferrying me over to Leonard?”

“Right, along with your purple pill,” Trixi said, as Liz positioned herself under her breast.

“I’ll bet you got Dian Parkinson when you were growing up,” Liz said, looking up at Trixi.

“Actually, I never did,” Trixi said, smiling gently. “I was a boy growing up, remember?”

“Oh, right! Sorry,” she said. “I just keep thinking most of you are like me, an old lady who now looks young.”

“We concentrate on who we are now,” Trixi said. “Now, don’t worry, I’m not embarrassed. Drink up,” she said as she lowered her breast into Liz’s mouth.

Peter stood at the edge of the rocky pool, looking out at the magnificent view. The late morning sun had burned off the dew from the jungle, but the air nearly two hundred meters above sea level was cooler and less humid than what Peter had encountered on his way up to the mountainside huts. Far beyond the gently curving arms of the lagoon below, a front was coming in from the east, a dark bank of clouds slowly approaching. They were about at least thirty miles out, and rain looked certain for the afternoon.

Peter stretched, enjoying the vitality he now felt after several feedings from Alexis, Liga, and Sally. His body thrummed with energy, but he wanted to enjoy the next steps he hoped to take in his journey towards becoming a mermaid. He kicked off the sandals he wore to protect his feet, an old habit for which Eric had teased him. He didn’t like not wearing shoes, and even though most everyone else had adopted the habit of wearing as little as possible, and the mers needed no protective wear on their fins and flukes, he still wore his sandals.

He reached down and picked them up, knowing that this was the last time he would wear them. Once he changed, they would no longer fit, and it would be only the next day or so before he was a mermaid himself and would have no further need of them. He walked over to the edge of the jungle and placed them carefully along the path back to the huts, wondering if anyone else would wear them. He pulled a relay box from his pocket, slipped his swim trunks down his legs, and stepped out of them. He folded them carefully and laid them over the sandals. Naked, he turned back towards the tub.

He looked down at his body, which the siren cells had largely healed. He didn’t quite look twenty-five, but he no longer looked like an old man. His hair had darkened and lengthened, and his torso had toned and tightened. He was still a slender man, but soon he would change that. He smiled, confident in what he was about to do.

That morning, Sally had accidentally let slip that others were making bets on his chances of changing into a girl on his own. After Valencia’s failure, the odds had shifted against his success. Peter, however, did not share that pessimism, and he walked with confidence back to the pool. He took a deep breath, and concentrated on the air that filled his lungs. Pure air. In and out. Breathe in and out. He placed the relay box near one of the listening holes and prepared himself for the next step.

He pictured in his mind the woman he wanted to become. Cynthia Myers had occupied a special place in his heart for a long time. He closed his eyes as he remembered her enormous brown ones, with her thick brown hair, and those amazing breasts. He didn’t know if he could affect his own change, but he was going to try. If nothing else, he would end up looking like other women in his family. A picture of his mother crossed his imagination, and though his mother was never going to be confused with Ms. Myers, the two shared some features in common. Both were brunettes, and both were about five foot four inches tall, and both shared an hourglass figure, though his mother’s breasts were much more modest than the playmate’s.

He opened his eyes and looked down into the pool, trying to imagine the tiny, microscopic animals that now lived in the water. He raised his hands to his face and looked at his classic male hands a final time. He had graceful hands, long elegant fingers that many had mistook for a pianist’s hands, and his ring finger was nearly as long as his middle finger. He made a fist, and wondered what it would look like after he finished changing. He lowered his hand to his groin and pulled gently on his scrotum, peeling it away from his thighs. His penis was filling with blood in response to his sexual imaginings, but for the moment, he ignored it.

He took another deep breath and stepped into the warm water. He waded into the center of the pool and looked at the view another time. The water barely reached his crotch, and he wondered how much shorter he might get. If he succeeded, the water would cover his new hips and crotch easily. He lowered himself into the water, resting on his knees, and closed his eyes. He focused on the picture in his mind of the ravishing beauty that had been Miss December 1968. He felt his cock stiffen as he remembered her beauty, but he imagined the bubbles forming on his body, forming on his cock, and turning it inside out, thrusting his own flesh inside himself. He held himself in this position for several minutes, concentrating.

He opened his eyes to check for bubbles and saw that they were beginning to appear. His heart soared and taking a deep breath, he lowered himself into the water. He felt a slight tickling as the bubbles formed on his face, and he held his breath for as long as he could. The bubbles continued to flicker all over his body, slowly rising from all around him. His body was changing, but it was only becoming younger and his hair lengthened only a little bit more.

He rose to take a breath, and returned to the warm embrace of the water. The bubbles slackened off, just as they had for Valencia. Noooo! He would not be so easily discouraged. He rose back to the surface and breathed deeply, in and out, trying to relax. He held his face to the sky, thinking on how he could trick his body into releasing large amounts of prolactin. After a few minutes of breathing, trying to relax his body, he had an idea.

He twisted his arms behind his back and intertwined his hands together, palm to palm. He imagined that Cynthia Myers was behind him and was pulling on his arms, wrestling him towards submission. He closed his eyes, imagining her in a black, rubber swimsuit, looking a bit like a female, comic book superhero. She laughed in his ear, he imagined, and warned him not to struggle. It was too late; she was going to force him to become her! Peter struggled against his captor, feeling her pulling him to the bottom of the pool.

He fought with his imaginary opponent, struggling to reach the surface for air and then giving up, falling below, struggling against the black suited succubus seeking his male essence. Minutes passed as he continued the charade, keeping himself just below the surface except for desperate, gasps for air. Just as he was about to give up on giving up, he felt it. His struggle against his imaginary captor increased as the bubbles began to reform, tickling his skin in his crotch, armpits, and along the bottom of his feet.

A brief stab of real fear shot through him, both because the tipping point had been reached and because he both desired and feared it at the same moment. Immediately pain shot through his body as the transformation cascade struck like a tsunami, bubbles exploding all around him. Desperately, he focused on his imaginary captor, seeing her body shake as she held him down against his own pain-induced flailing. The pain was just as quickly soothed by the spike in siren cells as they jumped from Type I’s to Type II’s, flooding his body with endorphins and a host of other hormones.

He moaned into the water as the siren cells and microorganisms did their work. His body twisted and turned, jerking with spasms as the transformation roared through his body. His head and face at first felt like jelly, shifting, pulling, pushing like silly putty, but soon his entire body felt as if it was being pressed and pulled in all directions. His lungs began to burn, and he really and truly struggled to rise for another breath. Adrenaline pumped through his body, and he found an accidental purchase on the bottom of the pool with one foot and weakly pushed up, his leg barely responding to his need. He breached like a whale, gasping for air as he fell back into the water, his body racked with a dull, low pain as his bones, muscles, and organs seemed to melt and rebuild.

Cynthia Myers laughed at him, looking down at him struggling under water.

“Do you want this?” she asked, reaching to the top of her suit and exposing a zipper he hadn’t seen before. “Is this what you really want?”

Peter nodded back, silently saying “yes, yes I want that. Give it to me.” The bubbles roared around him, and no part of his body felt stable. Every part of him was under assault. He couldn’t feel any individual changes because they were all happening at once.

He watched as the imaginary Ms. Myers slowly pulled on her zipper, exposing her deep cleavage, then down her thin waist, all the way to her wide hips, the hint of dark pubic hair visible.

“Then you shall have it,” she said, pulling the sides of the suit away from her body, exposing herself to him. A jolt of pleasure ran through him, and her body started to solidify.

She felt both her body and her mind turn that corner, and it felt wonderful, satisfying. Ha! I did it, she thought to herself. After a few, agonizing long moments, the bubbles began to slacken, and soon they evaporated completely. It was over. The water was still, and the new girl floated about two feet below the surface. She could still see her captor standing over her, naked, but then she realized that she was looking at the pale, watery reflection of her own body.

The nerves in her body suddenly sprang back to life, feeling the water caressing her everywhere. Her long, thick brown hair floated like a halo around her face, and she let her hips drop and pushed herself up to the surface of the water. Her hair lay draped across her shoulders and over her breasts and back. Quickly, she dunked herself back under, lifted her chin, and took a step forward while rising, forcing her hair to run down her back.

She looked down at herself. It had worked! She wasn’t sure if she was an exact copy or not, but she was close enough that she wasn’t worried about it. She couldn’t see her face in the water very well, but she looked more like Cynthia Myers than she looked like her mother. Her breasts, which now jutted from her chest, were clearly closer to the playmate’s than her mother’s. She raised her hand to her face, looking at how her slender and delicate index finger was now longer than her ring finger.

She lowered that hand to her breast and ran it over the large, soft mound. Her nipples, at least from this new angle, didn’t look like the ones she remembered the playmate having. Hers seemed smaller, tighter, but they stuck out from the rounded surface of her areola more than she expected. She ran a finger across one of her nipples, feeling it bend, and let it snap back forward. A twinge ran through her body, and she felt a heat rising in her stomach.

She reached back along her head, feeling her breasts lift as she did, and smoothed her hair into a ponytail. She pulled it off her back and brought it over her shoulder, letting the wet strands slap against her breast and stomach. She flinched, feeling the same twinge run through her body. God, breasts are sensitive, or at least hers were, she thought. She looked down and saw that the ends of her hair reached her hipbone, and flipped it back over her shoulder. She shook her head, feeling her hair slither across her back, the ends of her hair brushing against her now rounded and full rear end.

She ran her hands down her body, tracing the slope inward at her waist, then back out at her hips. She ran her hands behind her back, feeling her new dimples above each ass cheek, and then the firm but soft flesh of her ass. She ran her hands back around her wide hips, across her jutting bones, and then down the V-shaped gully running towards her new sex. Her questing fingers found the soft tangle of pubic hair just below the waterline. Below that were her thick, pouting lips. Heat seemed to emanate from those lips, and she ran her fingernails down along each rounded bulge.

She gasped, hearing her own soprano voice for the first time. She smiled and walked over to the edge of the pool. She turned around, slid up onto the outward facing rock wall, and turned sideways to the pool. She struck a classic cheesecake pose, her arms behind her, propping herself up, her breasts thrust into the sky, her full rounded ass resting on the flat rock, her knees bent, and her legs crossed at the ankles. She turned a smokey glance back towards the jungle, challenging her imaginary captor to judge her now!

Oh, yes. She could feel the power within her new body. She knew that if Michael could see her now, he would be nearly helpless before her. Her new sex churned at the thought, throbbing between her legs. She turned to face her imagined lover as he hid in the jungle, watching her. She dropped her legs into the water and spread them, teasing her viewer, feeling her lower lips peel apart like a flower. She arched her back, and brought her hands up under her breasts, lifting them as an offering, feeling their weight in her hands. The heat in her abdomen increased, and she let one hand drop to her crotch as she slowly teased the top of her sex, finding--and then avoiding--her clitoris. Her nipples tightened further, her upper hand now pushing and pulling on each magnificent breast, while her lower hand pushed a finger into her new sex, making her gasp a second time.

“Ooooohhhhhhh, sooooo gooood,” she sighed, moving her finger within herself.

She imagined Michael’s eyes upon her, and she quickened the circles she was making. A squishy, sucking sound rose as she began to push her body towards orgasm. Her breasts started to tingle, and she added the other hand to her crotch, her breasts now pressed together between her arms. One hand moved a finger in and out while the other pressed gently on her clit, rubbing the small, stiff button of flesh.

“Ahhhhhh,” she cried out, her body convulsing.

She was close, and she pretended that Michael, Liz, and Len were all walking towards her, mesmerized by her sexuality. She convulsed again, closer still. Her breasts started leaking milk. She felt those eyes upon her, and she arched her back again, yielding up herself to her orgasm and their attention.

“Oh, god, oh god, Oh God!” she cried as her first orgasm ran through her body, shaking her to her core.

Her orgasm slowly subsided, her body twitching less and less, and her breathing slowed. She slipped back into the water, letting it caress her. She twisted her shoulders back and forth, loving how the water pulled at her breasts. She dunked her head under, and then walked up and out from the pool. She reached over, picked up the relay box, and headed down the path. She was supposed to meet Michael back down on the beach, and now she was really, really, looking forward to it.

Valencia dropped her chin to the top of Maja’s head as she cuddled her sister-wife in her arms, her legs wrapped around Maja’s waist. Her sister-wife was small enough that Valencia could completely enfold her. Harry, as the three girls had decided they should call him, sat next to her with Antonia similarly enfolded within his arms. Maja’s thick hair smelled like the ocean, which was unsurprising since they had just spent the better part of an hour playing together in the surf. The four of them sat together on the beach, waiting as the mers and other humans discussed the bombshell Valencia just dropped on them.

“I think you are doing the right thing,” Antonia said, smiling from within Harold’s arms.

“Thanks, Antonia. That means the world to me,” Valencia said.

“Shush,” Maja said. “I’m trying to figure out what Pat is saying.”

Valencia looked over to where most of the mers had gathered on the beach, where Rani Basra had been arguing against any leniency for her father. She had a sudden inspiration, gave Maja a kiss on the crown of her head, and stood up. She walked over to Pat and waited for her to notice her.

“Yes, Valencia?” Pat asked as the young woman loomed over her.

“I know that my father has hurt and killed a great many people,” she began. “But I think that if we are going to try to discover whatever it is that mer justice will be, we must wait until we are all mers before we make such a decision.”

Everyone was now looking at her.

“I mean no disrespect for anyone’s pain,” she continued, feeling everyone’s eyes upon her. “But I respectfully suggest that we postpone any further discussion or decision about what to do with my father until everyone has transitioned into mers. It is because of my own transformation that I ask this, with the greatest humility and respect for everyone’s loss and pain.”

“Some things can never be transformed,” Rani insisted. “We cannot transform Geeta back from the dead!”

“I do not ask that you agree with my request not to kill my father,” Valencia said patiently. “I only ask that we gather again to discuss this after we have all become mers. I will abide by whatever decision we all make, but I know that I have changed, and that I am now free from my rash vow. If we decide to kill my father, it will because it is just and right to do so, not because the pain of what he has done feeds our anger and our thirst for vengeance.”

“That was surprisingly well spoken,” Pat said. She looked at the Basras. “Will you agree to wait until after you transition?”

There was a long moment of silence as Rani, Vidya and Sudhish shared agonized looks and choked sobs. They leaned their heads together in a family huddle, and shared a quiet, but urgent, conversation. After a few more moments of terse exchanges and more sobs, Rani stood up.

“Honor demands that such a polite request be respected. We will wait,” Rani said.

“If we ever have politicians in mer society,” John said. “I’m going to keep my eye on you.”

“I just want to try to do what is right,” Valencia said, not sure if she was being teased.

“If only all politicians felt the same way,” John said.

“Well, if we’re in agreement to wait, then we really ought to be getting these four back to the Moon Pool,” Pat said. “I’d like for us to not get caught out here in a storm, and besides, the sensor capsules I gave them an hour ago won’t last all day. Are you guys ready to go?”

“Yes, we’re ready,” Harold said, rising and pulling up Antonia and Maja.

“Great,” Pat said. “Mark, are you and your girls ready?”

“Ready,” he answered, his girls already salamandering towards the surf.

“Michael, are you and your pod still on schedule?” Pat asked.

“Peter should be returning shortly, hopefully a different person, and Liz and Leonard are waiting for our signal to head up towards the mountainside huts,” Michael said, scanning the jungle. “Did you get any word from the mers in the lab?”

“Phoebe?” Pat asked her sister-wife who sat in the shallow surf with the rest of her pod.

“Just a second,” she said, turning to put her body under the water. They all watched as she swam out into the lagoon a few meters out, hovered for a second, and then turned back towards the beach. A second later she surfaced.

“He did it, and you owe me a million dollars,” Phoebe said with a smile. “Let us know what name she’s chosen for herself.”

“That’s great!” Michael said. “We actually talked about it earlier, and she is going to use Pearl.”

“Good for Pearl!” Pat said. “I can’t wait to see the data on her transformation.”

“You still owe me one million dollars,” Phoebe said, teasing.

“Whatever. Everyone else remember what their assignments are?” Pat asked, looking around at the assembled throng. Everyone nodded and or voiced their assent.

“Rose?” Pat asked.

Rose shuffled forward, handing each of them a beautiful headband, woven from the sea itself, and adorned with hearts along each of the temple lobes.

“Why the hearts?” Pat asked.

“Because this is the first pod formed by volunteers; they chose to be a pod,” Rose explained. “And Valencia has shown herself to possess a great and forgiving heart.”

“Thank you,” Valencia said, her heart beating with emotion as she took the beautiful headband and slipped it across her forehead, tucking the ends under her hair, behind her ears. “I will try to live up to this gift.”

“You will,” Rose said. “You’re going to be very special, I can tell.”

There was a moment of silence, and then Pat said, “Let’s go,” turning to where John, Danni, and Phoebe waited with the children.

Valencia watched in gratitude and shock as the great and colorful gathering of mers all turned and headed for the beach. Mark’s pod hung back, waiting for them in the shallow water. Harold turned to her and arched an eyebrow, and Valencia felt the connection they had been building for the past sixteen hours vibrate with energy. She smiled back at him and nodded. Both Antonia and Maja nodded too, and the four of them joined hands and walked into the surf.

Trixi caught Valencia’s eye, signaling that she should come to her. Valencia looked at the beautiful mermaid, one who had been a male like her at one time, now having beautiful blond tresses flowing down her body, her incredible breasts wobbling behind the veil of hair, her blue and yellow striped tail curled beneath her as readied herself to ferry Valencia to the Moon Pool. She walked towards the blond goddess, and eased onto her back as the mermaid extended her body horizontally towards the open ocean.

As Trixi started to swim, Valencia felt the rush of the cool seawater over her body, so unlike the hot tub or when she and her pod-mates had been playing in the shallow surf. The water got colder as they moved out into the open ocean, but Valencia knew it would only be cold for a short while. She saw Antonia riding along the back of Binah ahead to her left, and Maja riding Homa on her right. At the front of the diamond formation used by all pods, her darling Harry rode just off to one side of Mark’s center, making room for Mark’s dorsal fin that sliced through the water as he swam.

Harold looked like he was body surfing, holding onto Mark’s shoulder with only one hand, moving his body back and forth, as they were towed by the mers. Antonia, Maja, and herself all held onto their mermaids with two hands and generally just enjoyed the feelings of closeness and warmth emanating from the mermaids beneath them. Harold looked back at his girls, grinning like a little boy playing with a toy as he sluiced back and forth in Mark’s wake.

They moved along the southern edge of the island, heading for the sheer cliffs dominating the western face of the island. Below those cliffs, lay the entrance to the mer caves. Valencia looked up at the cliffs as they loomed over her, wondering what great cataclysmic force thrust up this island when it first burst forth from the sea. The mers slowed down as they approached the center of the cliffs, and then they stopped.

“If anyone needs to have fresh air, just tap us on the shoulder and we can give you a quick breath,” Mark explained. “Your baby gills may be enough, but don’t be embarrassed if you get light-headed or dizzy. Ask for air, don’t make us give it to you. Got it?”

Everyone nodded, took a few deep breaths just in case, and the mers all pulled their passengers under the surface of the water.

Valencia tried to see what was happening under water, but not only was it difficult to keep her eyes open at the speeds the mers were moving but also the cloudy sky made the water seem darker than normal. She kept her focus on just the four of them, and watched as Mark and Harold entered the softly glowing entrance to the large tunnel that would take them inside.

The water seemed warmer inside the tunnel, and maybe it was just the system of softly glowing seaweed that gave the tunnel a warmer feeling, but Valencia thought it looked like a fairy land. They passed by a maze of exits from the tunnel, and Valencia was glad she had was merely a passenger. It must take mer senses to keep from getting lost in here, she thought. She felt a moment of panic as the air in her lungs seemed to grow stale, but the feeling passed as the fronds along her back grew stiff in the water and started to function for the first time. Soon they entered the Moon Pool.

Mark and his pod swam for the surface and eased their passengers towards the large shelf that ran along one side of the cave.

“There’s food along the wall,” he said. “Eat your fill while we coordinate with the girls in the lab to get everything ready. We’ll be back in a few minutes.”

They all turned and flipped over as they swam back under the water. Harold hoisted himself out of the water, then turned and helped each one of his girls out of the water, easily lifting them up onto the shelf. They walked over to the pile of fish, dried fruits, and sea grasses laid out along the wall and began to eat, knowing they were about to gain a significant amount of body mass.

“What colors do you want your tails to be?” Maja asked. “I want bright red tail with blue highlights.”

“Why red?” Antonia asked.

“I had an aunt who told me when I was a very young girl that red was my color,” Maja explained. “Red is also the color of passion … and … well …”

“Say no more,” Antonia laughed. “Red is your color! Well, if that’s your color, then blue is mine. I’d like a blue tail with red highlights so that everyone knows we’re sister-wives.”

“I would like a red and blue tail, equal parts, with white highlights,” Valencia said.

“What about you, Harry?” Maja asked. “What kind of tail do you want.”

“A strong one,” he said. “So I can keep up with all of you.”

“We’re ready for you,” Mark said, his head popping up out of the pool along with the rest of his pod. “Now, remember, you’re all going to go at the same time. Harold, you start with Bill’s girls, alright? Valencia you start with MuSu’s girls, Antonia with Tuo’s pod, and Maja with Wong’s girls. Everybody got it?”

They all nodded.

“Hey, why isn’t Pat worried about all the mermen being present?” Trixi asked. “Remember how they had to get out for you?”

“I thought the same thing when she gave us our assignment this morning,” Mark admitted. “But she explained that these guys are already bonded, and so our presence won’t affect Harold at all.”

“I was just worried that I’d have to feed from my sister,” Harold said.

“Yea, we wouldn’t make you do that, experiment or not,” Trixi said.

“Right, so how do you all want to turn out?” Mark asked.

Harold explained the color schemes they had chosen, explaining that he would like a dark blue one, and Mark and his girls disappeared beneath the surface to relay the info to the rest of the mers below them.

“I’m so glad that my father isn’t here,” Valencia said. “I don’t want him or his energy to be part of this moment.”

“We should kill a chicken and splash it’s blood on the doorstep,” Maja said. “Gotta keep out the bad spirits when you say his name.”

“How about I kiss you instead, and fill this room with love,” Valencia said, walking over to her tiny, Filipina sister-wife. “After seeing what these mers can do, I’m done with the silly superstitions of my grandmother.”

“Yes, I have an idea on how. Let’s really fill this room with love,” Antonia agreed. She moved Maja to the edge of the pool facing away from the water, and then guided Valencia to a spot near her, while she took the middle spot and together they faced Harold.

“Harry, do you forswear all others and take we three to be your podmates and sister-wives for as long as we all shall live?” Antonia asked solemnly.

He looked at the three, beautiful, naked woman before him. There was a flash of lightening and then a roll of thunder. The storm was upon the island. He glanced up and saw the rain coming in through the chimney hole above. He turned back to the girls.

“I forswear all others and through sunshine and rain, through sunsets and storms, I shall remain true to you at the peril of my life,” he said.

Valencia felt her heart swell as he answered. She took Antonia’s hand in her own and squeezed it, knowing that she was doing the same to Maja. The three of them looked expectantly at Harold. After a moment he said, “Oh, right. Yes. Do you, Valencia, Antonia, and Maja forswear all others and take me to be your pod-mate and husband for as long as we all shall live?”

“We do,” answered the three girls in unison.

Valencia and Maja reached out with their outside hands and invited Harold into a group hug and kiss. As they were sharing the group kiss, Antonia leaned backwards and pulled them all into the pool. They splashed into the water giggling and kissing, staying together as they slowly let air out to sink into the pool. When they had leveled off at about five meters below the surface, they found themselves surrounded by most of the mers. The only ones missing were John’s, Gabriel’s, and Eric’s pods, the ones with the mermaid scientists.

Valencia marveled at the colors and beauty surrounding them. The thirty-six mers were grouped by pod, and she swam over to Emma with her beautiful blue and white tail. She thought that her tail might look a bit like that, except hers would be blue and red, a union of Antonia’s and Maja’s tails, a sign of their shared sisterhood.

“As one who--like me--started as a boy, will you help me complete my final transformation?” Valencia asked Emma.

“Yes,” Emma answered, the energy of the transformation ceremony starting to swirl in her own belly and breasts. “Drink from me and receive your tail.”

Valencia drank from Emma’s breasts, draining each one in turn. When she was done, she turned to Rikki, and asked for her tail again. As she suckled at Rikki’s breasts, Valencia could hear her pod-mates ask for their tails as well. She drained Rikki and then moved to Cleo, her body now vibrating with the energy of the siren cells as they careened towards the tipping point for Type III. She only made it through one of Cleo’s breasts when she felt her legs stiffen and her arms pulled from her sides.

MuSu moved her rigid body into the center of the pool, and Valencia watched each of her pod mates positioned similarly. She became aware of a rich, harmonic hum that filled the water, and she felt herself beginning to spin. Suddenly, the pool erupted with bubbles, beginning her final transformation.

The following few minutes were a blur of euphoria, pain, joy, fear, and ecstasy feeling her body pulled, stretched, and morphed into the magnificently powerful and beautiful body of a mermaid. She was suddenly aware of her red and blue flukes, vibrating above her head, and her glorious mass of hair, now reaching below her hips, floating all around her.

Her mer organs started to function, and she felt the bright prickling of energy that connected her to her pod-mates strengthen and grow. She barely noticed the frenzy of activity surrounding her as the transformational estrus overwhelmed the pods. She only had eyes for her pod. Antonia was even more lush and beautiful than she had been, and even Maja’s curves had grown. Valencia felt the heat from the gazes her mates were giving her, and she looked down to see that her curves had grown as well.

By unspoken agreement, Antonia took the lead and positioned herself in front of Harold, Maja and Valencia on either side. All three girls gasped when they saw Harold’s mer penis emerge for the first time, telescoping out from his dark, blue tail. Antonia thrust her light blue hips against his, taking him in with a single thrust, while Maja and Valencia experienced the magic of pelvic fins for the first time. Valencia clutched Harold’s arm, hunching her hips into his fin as it pushed her deliriously towards her first mer orgasm. Her breasts were spraying milk into the pool, and she felt her sister-wives begin to orgasm too.

Later, when Valencia discovered what it felt like to have Harold’s enormous cock buried within her, she was gratified to discover that Harold retained his ability to go on and on without stopping.
