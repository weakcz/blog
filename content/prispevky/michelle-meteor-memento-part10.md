James Thompson awoke from one of the strangest dreams he ever had and was immediately faced with the most likely reason for this. Michelle was still sound asleep, her lips curled to a smile that begged to be kissed. 
<!--more-->
As tempting as it was, James had woken up for a reason and was now left with the task of getting out of bed without disturbing his girlfriend that had decided to use him as a pillow. Slowly he began to slip away from under her - which turned out to be harder than expected. Even though Michelle was rather small and light, she seemed to subconsciously reach out for him, not letting him go.

"Oh come on, I'll be right back," he whispered more to himself than to her, but strangely she seemed to get the hint. Finally out of bed, he wasted no time as he searched for the way to the bathroom.

 

 

The white space was exactly like Michelle remembered it, and unsurprisingly her other self was hovering in front of her again.

"Welcome back," her doppelganger greeted her with a smile.

"Good to see you too," Michelle answered. "I had a feeling we would meet again."

"Of course, after all it is you who makes this possible. I'm just glad you came again." Her other self still sported an innocent smile.

"To be honest, so am I. After all, I have a few questions to you." Michelle cut straight to the chase.

Her other self just smiled in response.

Michelle began. "You are probably aware of my new boyfriend..."

"Oh yes," her other self interrupted.

"I have felt that I can somehow read his mind. But surprisingly I was able to do it even when I was not in my enhanced form."

"And?"

"So far, I was only able to use these abilities when I was in that form, when I had this super energy at my disposal." Michelle continued.

"No you didn't," her other self flatly answered. "It's true that it's easier for you to use the super energy as you call it, once your body stores large quantities of it, but that doesn't mean that you're absolutely powerless without it. Your body does have the capability to turn other forms of energy into super energy and thus manipulate it to use these abilities."

"But why wasn't I able to do so before?"

"You were. How do you think we are talking to each other right now? It's basically the same kind of connection you dubbed 'Reading his mind'."

Michelle looked at her other self, dumbfounded. "Does that mean I can read other peoples’ mind as well?"

"I don’t think it is the mind reading you think of," her other self answered. "It’s more like a mental bond that allows you to communicate with those close to you, like him and me. I don’t think it will work on anybody you don’t have a connection with – unless you really want that."

Michelle wasn't sure whether or not she liked that. She was glad that she wouldn't be peeking into everybody's mind as several pieces of fiction would suggest, but it seemed like this wasn't definite.

"What do you mean with 'unless I really want it'?"

Her other self seemed clearly surprised at the question, but quickly regained her smile as she began explaining.

"There are certain kinds of abilities you possess. For one there are the abilities that you gained through your initial transformation, abilities that were embedded into your genes along with your ability to use and manipulate this energy..." She rose a bit higher into the air to emphasize her point. "Then there are the abilities that were the results of enhancing your own natural abilities..." She flexed her arms that immediately took on ridiculously defined proportions. "And finally there are abilities that you create through your imagination." Suddenly her eyes glowed an even brighter blue and a blue beam shot straight onto the nearby floor, leaving a black mark onto the otherwise perfectly white floor.

"Created through my imagination?" Michelle repeated, remembering the time she had learned to use her heat-vision. This had been an ability that Amanda had discovered before she had.  In fact, she had tried if she had heat vision before Amanda had even transformed for the first time, but Amanda had still suddenly figured out how to do it. This could only mean... "The heat vision wasn't created through my imagination at all, it had been Amanda who did it!"

"Indeed, it seems like your friend had a better imagination about how this ability should work, so she was able to use it before you were. But being the good friend she is, she immediately gave you this information."

"Ah, now I get it. When I absorbed her heat vision back then, I must've subconsciously picked up how to manipulate the super energy to use heat vision. In a twisted kind of way, Amanda taught me how to do it." It made sense, Amanda had been more into comics than her and several characters there possessed heat vision as a super power. So it was obvious that Amanda had a clearer idea about how heat-vision would work, no matter how subconsciously.

Her doppelganger nodded affirmatively.

"Your imagination and your creativity allow you to reach heights that I would never be able to."

"That sounds a bit contradicting since you're the one hovering."

"Then why don't you join me?"

Michelle looked at her doppelganger as if the latter had just said something insane. But now that she thought about it, this was a dream - or at least close enough to being one. The fact that she had reverted to her normal self before getting to bed shouldn't mean anything here, right? She concentrated, normally flying was so easy, it was hard not to do it, but now it felt like actual work. A slight pain began forming in her body - a pain she was awfully familiar with. Only a few hours earlier she had felt it when she had used her flight powers to carry a whole plane - or at least slow down it's descend for a safe landing. This pain was similar, like using a sore muscle - except spread throughout her body. The comparison made sense since Michelle had overused her flight powers back then. Concentrating harder, she could finally feel herself becoming lighter, gravity slowly losing its hold on her. The pain grew, but eventually she felt herself becoming completely weightless. Michelle felt this inner happiness that had made flying her favorite power, despite the strain she felt along with it. Somehow this made things even easier for her, as Michelle felt a strange sense of accomplishment as she hovered inches, then feet into the air. Even though her mobility was nothing compared to what she was capable of when in her super form, Michelle couldn't help but return her doppelgängers smile.

 

 

James stared at the scene that was unfolding in front of him. He had only left the room for a few minutes, but the difference was unmistakable. Even in the darkness of the room it was obvious that Michelle was not lying in her bed anymore - but hovering a few feet above it. That wouldn't have surprised him had she been in her superpowered blonde form, but this wasn't the case.

James had actually barely noticed her return actually, being sound asleep at that time. Well at least he had dreamed about her.

Stepping closer to his hovering girlfriend, he could make out that she was smiling, a gesture he subconsciously mimicked. What's more she seemed to float into his direction as well. As if she was sensing him. Eventually they were only inches apart. James was tempted to touch her, but was afraid that his sudden touch would end her hovering. So he reached out from under her, to catch her in case she would indeed stop flying the moment he touched her. As he put his arms around her bare backside, she indeed seemed to stop flying, but her body remained ridiculously light as he held her in his embrace. A slight moan escaped her lips as her weight slowly increased.

James didn't waste any time and lowered Michelle down onto the bed right as she opened her eyes.

"Hey sweetheart," he whispered.

Michelle reached up and kissed him. It took James a second to realize that she seemed a bit exhausted as she did that. This was strange. James could understand if she was sleepy right after waking up, but it seemed more like her hovering just now had put a huge strain on her body.

"How do you feel?" He had to know for sure.

Michelle looked at him, her brown eyes barely recognizable in the darkness yet her expression was pretty clear.

"It feels like every cell in my body aches, but other than that I can't complain." She smiled.

"You do know what you did just now, right?"

Michelle nodded slightly. "It's a lot harder now than in my other form. But it is manageable." She sounded happy about this.

James couldn't really claim to feel the same seeing her like this.

"You seem concerned," Michelle whispered.

"I am. Seeing you this exhausted breaks my heart and I don't want that."

"Well, it's not that bad, you know. Compare it to a workout.You wouldn't be concerned if I was exhausted because of that, right?"

"A workout takes a bit longer than a minute to get you exhausted."

"I think I was still exhausted from the whole airplane thing. Lifting it really drove me to my limit and if you hadn't encouraged me to drink the extra doses, I would've failed."

"You carried an airplane?" James was surprised at how little it actually shocked him. After all he had earlier dreamt something along the lines of Michelle lifting an airplane. What if it hadn't really been a dream?

"Yeah pretty much. And it hurt like hell doing so, maybe I overexerted myself there. But if I hadn't things could've turned very ugl...mpf."

Michelle hadn't been able to finish her sentence because James had decided to kiss her. It took over a minute for them to break it.

"Hm," Michelle seemed a bit dizzy as she said that, lying back into her pillow.

"Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?" James asked his concern gaining the upper hand over the pride of Michelle's heroic feat.

"Hey, I'm just a bit exhausted. Nothing a good night’s sleep can't fix."

"It's 4am; there isn't much of a good night to sleep anymore. And besides, this might be a side-effect of taking too much of the potion."

Michelle shook her head. "No. It was definitely the strain when I carried the plane. Flying back here wasn't fun either since I was almost out of energy. As I said, compare it to a hard workout."

"How about taking a small sip from the potion then? Would it make things better or worse?"

"What do you mean?"

"The problem came with you running out of energy, right? Maybe this is some kind of withdrawal? Taking the potion now would help at first, but eventually it would make things even worse."

"The old addiction theory, huh? I've been wondering about that for some time now and came to the conclusion that this stuff isn't meant to be addictive. We already know that the actual changes come with the first transformation, the following ones have no effect per se."

"I wouldn't say that. After all you weren't able to fly before this, weren't you?"

"Actually, I was. It's just that in my current form, I'm not able to use as much energy at once. Flying was possible, but through last night I learned how to push myself further. To use this ability efficiently enough so that it's possible even when I'm not filled with super energy. Maybe that's why I was able to return home with almost no energy left."

"So you're saying that it was like an actual workout for you?"

Michelle nodded."I don't need the potion right now, but if you really want to make me feel better..." She smiled. Even in the darkness of the room, James could see that it was a wicked smile that didn't require her to finish the sentence.

He reached down to kiss her and her sweet scent filled his nose. Thanks to the recent revelations about Michelle's powers, he figured that her current scent was laden with pheromones much more potent than those of any other woman - not that he cared right now. Their lips met and what was originally intended to be a slight romantic gesture soon turned into passionate kissing.

As his hands traced her naked body, Michelle let out a slight moan. James couldn't tell whether she was moaning out of pleasure or pain. Most likely a mixture of both. Not too long ago this petite woman had carried a whole airplane. She had also looked very different while she did it. James remembered the differences as he felt her body in the darkness. Compared to the blonde goddess from last night, Michelle seemed rather frail right now, but there was no doubt in his mind that she was indeed the same person.

Michelle became more active, her legs wrapping around his waist as she kissed him again. Once they broke their kiss, she guided him downwards. He kissed her chin, her neck and moved downward her body as he heard her whisper "Here it comes," followed by an audible gulp.

It didn't take long for James to figure out what had happened. Michelle's body arced. as she let out a small yelp. James could feel her body turning warmer under him, and he looked up into the direction of her face. Finding her eyes turned out to be a lot easier than expected as he found them glowing as they stared into his own. She was transforming.

James could feel his girlfriend changing under him, the feeling of her skin stretching along his as her body grew was amazing - and her moans clearly showed that it was even better from her perspective. Those were unmistakably moans of pleasure. With his hands on her belly, James could feel her abs hardening, turning into the six-pack he had seen on her earlier.

Michelle took his hands and guided them back upwards, and James realized what she intended. Cupping her still A-cup breasts he could feel a slight rumble from them right before they started expanding.  It was unbelievable. Having seen her transformation before, James would've compared the growth of her breast to balloons filling with air, but the feeling of it happening with his hands was on a whole different level. He could feel a strange warmth emanating from them as they rose like loaves of bread under his hands, pushing them back. Instinctively, James tried to push back, squeezing Michelle's expanding breasts in the process.

"Oh my god!" she screamed as her body suddenly began shaking involuntarily, rising from the bed in the process. James quickly felt himself getting lifted up as well, clinging to Michelle's weightless body as the latter came in midair. He wondered if she simply wanted to prevent her superpowered orgasm to destroy her bed or whether it was her instincts taking over. As if to answer his question, Michelle suddenly hugged him with a force that should've killed him three times over - but only made it hard for him to breathe. She was ignorant of that fact as she was still lost in the extreme pleasure she was feeling right now - yet at the same time she subconsciously prevented herself from actually hurting James. Just as the desire for air became a critical part of his thought process, James felt the ridiculous strong grip on him weaken allowing him to restock on the precious oxygen all while Michelle's orgasm subsided.

He slid down her body. Now that he thought about it, Michelle had reached climax so fast, he had barely gotten started. Talk about being easy to please, he thought to himself, as he watched Michelle enjoying her afterglow in midair. Her sweet scent still completely filled the room and James didn't really want their lovemaking to be over already. He kissed his way down her body, starting at her now massive breasts which immediately caused Michelle to moan even more, working his way over her steel hard abs down to her neither region. Her hovering really came in handy here – Michelle just rose higher instead of James getting lower. Upon reaching her dripping sex, he wasted no time and immediately began eating her out.

 

 

Michelle’s orgasm had barely begun to subside as she felt James kisses travel down, along her body. The pain of her earlier overexertion seemed like a distant memory now. Just like she had expected, the super energy had washed it away during her transformation. She had activated her super senses immediately and with the added sensitivity the feeling of her changing body against his has been enough to drive her over the edge. And now that James was moving down her body she didn’t want to deactivate them. What reason would she have to decrease her pleasure anyway?

Everything felt just right to her now. Without a second thought, she had opened up a telepathic link to her lover, hearing whispers of his thoughts, feeling his emotions, his lust, his love. She could even tell how her own body tasted like for him as she rose further into the air. God this felt great. And here she had thought their previous lovemaking right before her patrol had been out of this world, but this was at a whole different level. Who would have thought that super senses had this kind of benefit? But that wasn't all there was to it. Michelle had assumed that the feeling of heat vision on her breasts had been the most pleasurable thing she had ever felt, but this was no longer true. No matter how great it felt for bullets to bounce off her invulnerable chest or pure energy be just as ineffective - actually making her more powerful in the process - nothing beat the warmth of the human touch that actually intended to pleasure her.

The pleasure between her legs was reaching a new high point and Michelle found herself mentally cheering James on as his tongue worked her most private parts. And sure enough he readily followed her mental wishes showing that their telepathic connection was indeed no one-way road. Once again Michelle began to feel her climax approaching, and the super energy inside her body seemed to intensify. She could feel a lot of it flowing into James, shielding him from the incredible forces her body was capable of. As a matter of fact, her legs were pressing against his head with more force than a scrap metal press, but she knew that it didn't feel like that for him. From his perspective it was more like the force any normal woman's thighs could muster. Just as she realized that he had absolutely no fear of accidentally being hurt by her, her second orgasm hit her like an atomic bomb.

"Ahhhh," she screamed as her body shook involuntarily. The super energy inside her was suddenly going through her like a series of electric shocks - extremely pleasurable electric shocks. It was such an incredible mixture. While her body was experiencing physical pleasure that she couldn't have dreamt of, Michelle’s mind reveled in the feelings she picked up from James. As trivial as it sounded, nothing felt better than to know for a fact that the man she was with right now genuinely loved her. Forcing her legs apart a bit, she released the grip she had on James' head. With a quick movement, she hauled James on top of her, kissing him deeply as a thanks for the pleasure that was still coursing through her body.

Michelle then put her legs around him again, slowly guiding his member into her still quivering sex. Even though she had come twice already, her lover still had yet to do so and Michelle wouldn't let that slide. Still engulfed in their kiss, Michelle opened her eyes to see a faint blue glow in James' eyes. For a second she wondered if she had somehow affected him in a way she hadn't expected, but then quickly realized that it was the glow from her own eyes that was reflected in his.

Entwining his fingers with her own, Michelle stretched their arms out as they were still locked in their kiss and their eyes locked into each other’s. She kept them both afloat with her flight powers as she began the next step in their lovemaking. All over her body, tiny threads appeared. Instead of forming her costume or any kind of clothing for that matter, these threads began to gently caress James' body while her vagina began massaging his member.

She had to keep herself from laughing out loud as she saw James' eyes widen at the sudden sensations he was experiencing now. Oh my god, how are you … this is incredible … I can't believe you can do that. James thoughts were pretty messed up, but Michelle knew what he was trying to convey. After all, like everything else, her control over her private parts was incredible which enabled her to massage him in ways he wouldn't have believed possible. She closed her eyes to fully concentrate on the task at hand.

The afterglow of her second orgasm was beginning to subside - only to be replaced by the buildup of her third one. Through her mental connection Michelle knew that this time she wouldn't be the only one to reach the climax. Opening her eyes again she noticed that the glow in her own eyes had intensified as she now illuminated his whole face. Once again the feeling of the super energy inside her seemed to intensify even though it hadn't grown weaker since the last time. Michelle didn't even have time to wonder about that as both she and James came together.

Like before, waves of super energy bolted through her body like electric shocks, but instead of spasming uncontrollably, Michelle was perfectly still - she didn't want to jeopardize the embrace she shared with James. The energy inside her on the other hand was going wild and she almost got lost in the sheer amount of pleasure. She instinctively concentrated on her mental connection with James and through his eyes noticed that it wasn't just her eyes that were glowing now. Her entire body was beginning to emit a faint glow as the super energy coursed through it. Michelle had no idea why this happened, but it felt far too good for her to care. The couple kissed again while their pleasure seemed to last forever.

Never before had Michelle felt so happy. As she enjoyed the afterglow, she could finally allow herself to land on the bed again. Together in total happiness. Through the mental connection she could tell for a fact that he loved her unconditionally. Sure there were doubts, fears and even concern about her condition, but that didn't change the simple fact that he had fallen for her - and she for him. And with this in mind, the still embracing couple entered the realm of dreams.

 

 

Amanda soared through the early morning sky. The city was still fast asleep but the redheaded supergirl felt more awake than ever. She had spent the whole night in her super form and - most importantly - with her boyfriend at the hospital. While it was a pain to hide whenever the nurse came to check his status, Amanda still considered it one of the best nights of her life so far. Unfortunately, she still had to work early, and was about to get home to change - in more ways than one.

As she flew over the park, she was still lost in thought. Now that Fred knew about her powers he clearly wouldn't keep the reason for his cheating concealed from her any longer. After what felt like eternity for her, things were finally looking up again.

Unfortunately for her, Amanda wasn't looking upwards right now, causing the attack to hit her without warning. A loud thud and a slight pain went through her back as she was propelled towards the ground. With a loud boom her body crashed into the ground, dirt flying everywhere.

It took Amanda a second to realize what had happened: Someone had punched her right out of the sky. And considering the fact that she actually felt the punch - not to mention that she had been flying quite high anyway - the attacker would need to have superpowers as well. As Amanda got back up and out of the crater she had created, she instinctively wished the attacker to be Michelle and the attack to be nothing more than a weird prank. Her heart dropped as she spotted her attacker.

It wasn't Michelle. The woman that hovered above had the same kind of physique that both Amanda and Michelle had gained along with their powers, but her jet black hair and matching black eyes made it clear that this was a totally different woman. Those eyes stared at her with a furious anger that drove away the last shreds of doubt that this beauty had indeed attacked her. The raven haired woman hovered a few inches above the ground with her arms crossed. She wore a red leather jacket that struggled to keep her enormous bust in check as well as a black skirt and matching black boots.

"Who are you?" Amanda tried to sound as calm and intimidating as she could. This was easier said than done since her improved eyesight was able to see the amount of super energy her attacker possessed. And it was quite a bit more than Amanda had at her disposal. After all Amanda had spent the whole night in this form and would soon run out of power.

"I could ask you the same," the other woman sneered. "But I doubt that you would answer honestly."

"What do you want?" Amanda knew that negotiations were her best bet here.

"How about I beat the crap out of you?" With this the other women shot straight at Amanda.

Amanda managed to dodge at the very last moment. As her attacker flew past her, she managed to launch a counterattack by punching her right into the stomach. Amanda felt her fist going through the relatively soft leather of her opponents jacked and then hitting the rock hard stomach.

The force of her punch shot her opponent onto the ground where she ripped a long scar into the park meadow. Sure enough, her opponent rose again, her expression even more angered than before. The black-haired woman didn't wait long before launching another attack. Once again she came straight at Amanda, who attempted to counter in a similar way. But her opponent had anticipated this, stopping in midair right before she would've passed Amanda - whose punch hit nothing but air this way.

"Take this," the raven haired beauty said as she spun around in midair to deliver a kick right into Amanda's stomach. It connected with a loud boom.

The redheaded woman felt how the air left her lungs and how the super energy concentrated in her stomach to prevent any damage to her. Still, the velocity of the kick caused her to fly several hundred feet backwards before she managed to stabilize herself.

Gasping for air, Amanda looked back at her enemy. She was almost out of super energy while her enemy was still as good as new. With such a huge difference in power, the battle was already over. Amanda's only chance was to get her opponent to somehow waste a lot of super energy. But how would she do it?

Her enemy was approaching again, this time slowly floating towards her with an arrogant smile on her face. Amanda noticed that the other woman's outfit had suffered quite a bit during the battle. The red leather jacket had been ripped open by the force of Amanda's punch, exposing her enemies toned midriff. The right boot had suffered even more and was nowhere to be found. It seemed like the kick earlier had utterly destroyed it.

A smirk appeared on Amanda's face, if she played her cards right, she might win after all. She concentrated the super energy in her eyes and shot two orange beams of heat vision at her opponent's remaining boot, cutting it open, and then proceeded to do the same with the left sleeve of the other woman's jacket.

"H-hey stop it," the other woman complained as she realized that Amanda's attack were more focused on her wardrobe than herself. "This isn't hurting me at all."

"You attack me out of nowhere and now you complain about cheap shots?" Amanda teased.

"Alright, two can play this game!"

Amanda could barely prevent herself from laughing. She had used her last bit of power to provoke her enemy to do just that. A few days ago when she had first used her heat vision, Amanda had learned that it was utterly ineffective against another superpowered person. Instead of being hurt, this person would absorb the blast and turn it into super energy. Amanda had carefully aimed at her opponent’s wardrobe mainly because the other woman's answer would replenish her supply of super energy a bit, evening the odds to actually give her a fighting chance.

"Argh, how do you do it?" The raven-haired women said in frustration.

Now that wasn't part of Amanda's plan. She had feared that the other woman knew about the way heat vision was absorbed, but hadn't anticipated the possibility that her opponent might not even know how to use this power. Damn, and Michelle had been able to use it right away...

The raven-haired beauty visibly tried to mimic her stunt, but with no success. The super energy concentrated in her eyes, but she didn't shoot anything out of it. Eventually she gave up and looked back at Amanda - surprised.

"You're not glowing the way you did before..." she exclaimed.

Amanda bit her lip. This girl had no idea of the powers she possessed, that she could see Amanda's lack of super energy. She didn't even know that she had pretty much won this battle already. It was so frustrating. In a fair battle, Amanda would have had the upper hand; her superior knowledge would have allowed her to defeat this woman. But this woman had attacked her when her energy was low to begin with - and to add insult to injury she hadn't even knowingly used this advantage! Amanda's thoughts raced. She remembered how Fred had mentioned that the cops were searching for another superwoman that had injured a man. Was this her?

"Is this your first time transforming?" Amanda asked. Continuing the fight was futile, so negotiating was all she had left. Maybe she could gain a vital piece of information and - hopefully - survive this whole ordeal. She shuddered at the realization that her life might actually end shortly - just because some random chick attacked her out of nowhere.

"Do you really think I want to chat with you?" the other woman retorted. Once again she flew straight into Amanda's direction crossing the distance in the blink of an eye.

After her failed attempt at a counter attack, Amanda decided it would be better to dodge. But her enemy had decided to go into close combat as well, throwing a series of punches that Amanda was barely able to dodge. In fact each punch was getting closer and closer to connecting and after a series of five misses, Amanda was hit straight into her face.

The force of the punch was not as big as the previous ones, but the effect was a lot more than before. Previously, her super energy had prevented any damage from happening, but with her supply running low this couldn't be prevented anymore. Amanda's nose broke under the punch and within a few microseconds healed itself with the remaining super energy she had left. Even though the injury lasted for such a short time, the pain of having her nose broken remained for much longer.

Stumbling backwards due to the punch, Amanda was too disoriented to pay attention to her enemy. The other woman was surprised that her punch had done any damage, so she didn't immediately land another one. Instead, she prepared a lashing kick aimed at her left knee.

Amanda didn't have the slightest chance at dodging. With no super energy left, all she managed was to look helplessly as the other woman's bare foot connected with her knee and a series of disgusting crunching sounds went through her body as she lost her balance. Only when she hit the ground, did the pain finally reach her brain.

"Ahhh," Amanda screamed out in pain. This was it, the fight was over - She had lost. There was no super energy left to heal this wound. What's more, with no super energy left, her body also reverted back to her normal self. The fact that her bones tried to shrink back to her usual position only multiplied her suffering.

Looking back up, Amanda barely saw her opponent anymore. Without her powers, she was almost unable to make out the other woman in the darkness, and the tears in her eyes didn't help either. She felt the other woman chowing her lightly, causing Amanda to lie on her back. Now Amanda realized that she was naked - her costume had disappeared along with her powers.

Next the black haired beauty put her bare foot onto Amanda's chest. For some reason Amanda didn't find this victory pose to be that inconvenient. Mostly because the other woman didn't apply too much pressure and her foot was a lot warmer than the cold floor she was lying on. Too bad it didn't help with the pain that was still throbbing through her leg.

"You... so this is who you really are?" the other woman sounded a bit surprised and even removed her foot. "But why did your clothes disappear?"

Amanda forced herself to chuckle, but the pain made it turned it into a gasp at best, leaving no doubt that it was fake. "Do you really think I want to chat with you right now?"

"You are aware that you're at my mercy right now, right? Can you imagine what happens if I apply a bit more pressure here?" she put her foot back on Amanda’s chest to empathize her point.

"My ribcage will break, puncture my lung and I will die," Amanda answered flatly. "If that's what you want I suggest you get it over with."

"You're talking about your own death as if it wouldn't mean anything. But with my foot so close to your heart I can literally feel your pulse and know that you lie. Who do you try to impress? It's only natural to be scared of death. Even if you have always been prepared for the case of your own death, this fear simply can't be prevented"

Amanda gritted her teeth; the other woman had a point here. The idea of dying here scared her to no end. What good would all the hardships of the last days have been if she died now?

"Just because I fear death doesn't mean I'll give you any kind of information. You came here to beat me up and reached your goal. There's absolutely no reason for me to help you in any way."

"Seems like you're not valuing your life enough. Aren't there people who'd miss you if you died? Do you really want to burden them with the sadness of losing you just because you don't want to tell me about your magically disappearing outfit?"

Amanda's eyes narrowed, an expression that failed to intimidate considering the tears that still lingered in them. "Are you threatening my friends?" she spat.

The other woman's eyes widened in return. "That's not what I said." She looked around nervously. "W-What kind of monster do you think I am?"

"Someone who kills over fashion advice." Amanda gritted her teeth to fight of the pain in her leg.

This seemed to reach the other woman as she looked around, obviously thinking about how to proceed. Sure enough the hypocrisy of asking a naked woman for clothes and threatening her despite her already being injured got to her.

"It’s not like I attacked you entirely without a reason, you know?"

Seconds passed until it seemed like the raven-haired beauty had come to a conclusion. But instead of saying something, she simply looked back down to Amanda. It took a while until Amanda realized what the other woman was doing. Through the pain in her legs, she had trouble noticing the increasing warmth in the other woman's foot on her chest. But now that she noticed, she quickly understood the reason behind it: The other woman had decided to share some of her super energy with her. All Amanda had to do was accept it and...

"Ahh.." Amanda moaned as the energy suddenly flooded into her, causing her to quickly transform back into the red-headed amazon she had been a few minutes earlier. Her breasts surged outward while her whole body gained in size. But what was most important to Amanda right now, was that her ruined knee settled back in position and healed within seconds as well. Soon enough the other woman halted the stream of power and waited until Amanda's transformation was over.

"Wow, it looks a lot more impressive on you than it felt for me," the raven-haired beauty exclaimed absentmindedly.

Amanda avoided a grin as she went back up – this statement proved that the other woman had only transformed once so far.

"So are you going to tell me about your outfit now? I fixed you, now tell me how to fix my wardrobe!"

Had she repowered Amanda just to ask this question? Amanda wondered if the other woman wasn’t as malevolent as she had originally expected or if she was simply nuts.

"Just imagine the clothes you want to wear and create them." While she said that, Amanda created a black bikini with red flames in the same vein as her costume had been. Amanda avoided mentioning the energy consumption. This woman could see the super energy and she had witnessed her using it right now, so she couldn’t blame Amanda if she overdid it.

The other woman nodded and looked down at her bare foot. Sure enough she summoned the strange material and willed it to form a perfect replica of the boot that had been destroyed during their fight. Amanda was rather impressed with that. While she knew herself that the creation process was rather intuitive, she had struggled with the creation of acceptable boots on her costume. The boots she had come up were basically socks with thicker soles. But this woman had managed to even create heels.If only she had figured out the heat vision just as easily as this, Amanda thought to herself.

"Ha! That sure beats the hell out of shopping for an outfit."

"Yeah, I gotta go." Amanda prepared to leave.

"What? Why?" The other woman pouted, but only for a second. "Don't tell me you have to go to work already?"

"As a matter of fact I do." Amanda didn't see any reason for her to hide that part as she rose into the air. The other woman had seen her true self, after all.

"Well then, I should let you go, I guess. After all I’ll remember your face." The other woman made no intention of stopping or following Amanda. In fact she waved her goodbye.

 

 

Half a minute later Amanda landed inside her apartment. She was still shaken up by the encounter with that strange woman. There were so many questions about her floating in her head. Why had she attacked her? And why had she stopped? Who was she? Where had she gotten her powers from? How much did she know? Why had she healed her in the first place? Remembering the fight and the humiliation that had come with it, Amanda involuntarily clenched her fists. Immediately her arms exploded in size, the dormant musculature sprang to life as she flexed her muscles and the effect began to spread over her shoulders, back and her entire body. Normally Amanda would've prevented such a hulk-out to happen because it used up a lot of super energy, but right now that was her intention. Her shift was going to begin soon and she had to use up her reserves in order to transform back.

The effect hadn't even covered her whole body when she finally ran out of super energy, causing her to transform back again. A few seconds later when Amanda looked into the mirror the titanic redhead had turned back into the usual blonde... that was still wearing the black bikini with red flames on it. Amanda looked down at herself, surprised. "Why the hell didn't you disappear?"

 

 

The first ray of sunlight was enough to wake Michelle up. She opened her eyes slowly and could barely believe how awake she felt. It took a second for her to remember that she was still in her super form, lying in bed entangled with James just like she had been when she fell asleep. How much time had passed since then? Couldn't be that long since her energy supply didn't feel any lower than before. In fact she still felt like she had the full dose worth of energy - maybe her sleep had halted her energy consumption.

"Hmm" she heard a slight moan coming from her chest. Unsurprisingly it came from James whose head rested on her breast and who was in the process of waking up as well. &quot M...morning," he yawned before reaching up to kiss her - a gesture that caused Michelle to become airborne right away.

"Hey there."

"How are you feeling?" James still seemed concerned.

"Super, as if I had slept for days."

"No more pain because of the plane?"

"Absolutely none, see I can barely keep myself grounded as it is."

James broke the kiss and looked down. Sure enough he saw that Michelle had lifted them a few feet above the bed by now.

"You really are amazing," he finally spoke out. His expression showed the surprise as he realized that up until now their whole conversation had been mental in nature. "You're reading my mind again?"

"If you want to call it that way." Michelle rolled her eyes. "But I prefer calling it our private channel."

"Now that has a nice ring to it." He kissed her again.

 

 

"Do they really think we'll believe this stuff?"

"There's no way that actually happened."

"Is that a sign that the end is near?"

Amanda was beginning to tire of the comments she had heard all morning long. They all regarded the news about a real-life angel preventing a plane-crash. The video footage confirmed Amanda's immediate suspicion that it was Michelle who had done that. This was it. The existence of super powers were becoming public knowledge and Michelle clearly had done a great job for a first official rescue. Now she was even compared to an angel while Amanda herself had decided for the codename 'Devil'. It couldn't get more ironic than that. When it came to Amanda, all seemed to go according to plan - if it weren't for some random chick showing up out of nowhere to first beat her up and then act as if they were best friends.

The gossip didn't include any other superwoman, though. Neither the black-haired newcomer nor her own alter ego had made the news so far, not to mention any other possible person with access to the plant potion. Still the idea that a woman had prevented a plane crash by carrying the plane to safety - sounded too strange for most patrons in the restaurant for them to believe it.

The only thing that distracted Amanda from the sudden fame that her best friend had achieved and the assault by this other superwoman was one text message from Erika in which she asked Amanda to come by after work. Amanda pondered the implications of that. Maybe Erika had decided to tell her whatever Fred was still hiding? That would be nice, although she was pretty sure that Fred would sooner or later come clean with her. After all, he knew about her powers now. For some reason this sounded only half as good as it had felt last night.

A small rumble in her stomach had been the only warning for Amanda before she realized that her feeling not so good wasn't entirely psychological in nature. Before she knew it, she was speeding towards the bathroom, barely opening up the toilet seat before throwing up. Amanda wondered why she suddenly felt this nauseous, but after a short while this feeling subsided. She probably had eaten something bad, or she was getting sick again.

With a chuckle she remembered how she had cut short her last cold by simply drinking the potion. If she really was getting sick, she should better ask Michelle for another dose to get herself back on track. Now that she thought about the healing capabilities of the potion, she also realized that this would probably heal Fred's ruined knee as well. Why hadn't she thought about that sooner? And what's more, why did it feel like a horrible idea right now? Some part of her was definitely against it, even though she couldn't imagine why. Amanda then decided it would be best to have a chat with Michelle about that. She somehow felt like it had been ages since they last talked with each other.

 

 

"Are you going to be alright?" James eventually asked as they watched the news.

"Of course I am," Michelle retorted. "It's just another day at work for me."

"Yes but this work happens to be the lion's den when it comes to people chasing you."

"I know how this goes, they won't even expect their newest scoop walking around in their middle. And the incident took place in a whole different city to boot."

"Unless you begin to fly again..." James joked.

"That's unlikely. I mean I can fly right now, but it's quite a strain and won't happen accidentally."

"The question is: For how long?" James sounded more serious now. "You said you took about an hour to fly around the world last night before you saved that plane. But just earlier when you did so again, you managed it in about half the time. In other words your little workout made you twice as fast as you were before. If you keep this trend up you might be able to fly with no problem eventually "

"I did have to use up all the energy to transform back, after all. But you have a point there. The more I use it, the more efficient I get. But there has to be a limit to that as well. I mean it's impossible to be more than 100% efficient, right?"

"Indeed. But I wonder what else you'll be capable of once you reach that level. You can already fly in your normal form, so it's entirely possible for you to be stronger and more resilient as well. We should try and measure things to be sure."

"You mean like some kind of fitness checkup? Sounds nice, but we have to be careful not to draw attention about that."

"That's a given. I'll see if I can arrange some place to test things out in private. It might be helpful to bring your friend too, after all she is the only comparison we have."

Michelle bit her lip as she heard that. She just realized that she had given away the fact that Amanda had drunk the potion too a bit too easily. Even though she trusted James on this, Amanda might see this differently."I'll see what I can do."

 

 

Even though Michelle had said that she would be fine, she still had a bad feeling when she arrived at work. Wherever she walked, people were talking about her nightly escapades.

"I'm telling you, this is a sign. First fire from the sky, now a real-life angel, trust me this is a sign that the end time is near!" came the voice of one of Michelle's more religious colleagues when she entered her department.

"Get a hold of yourself, this isn't the bible channel!" This voice belonged to Debbie Lynton a former reporter at the station. Debbie had moved out of town quite some time ago, so Michelle was visibly surprised when she saw her former colleague who looked at her with the same look of surprise. "Holy mother of god, Jenkins is that you?"

"Didn't you just say this is not the bible channel? And yes it is me." Michelle had to chuckle at the reaction. The whole company had quickly grown accustomed to her new improved looks but Debbie didn't know about that. "What brings you back here, Debbie?"

"Work, of course. I'm after a huge story, and as fate wants it, the story led me back to my old home."

"I see, well too bad you missed the current hot scoop by about a hundred miles," Michelle joked, hoping that the other woman wouldn't see through her lie. Debbie was good when it came to investigating after all.

"You've got no idea how many times I heard that joke today, Michelle. But speaking of which, what is your opinion about that incident last night?"

"It's quite hard to believe, if that's what you mean. But I'm not really a fan of the whole 'Angel' story they make of it. The video material clearly shows that the wings only served to carry the plane - as strange as it is - but nothing more."

Debbie nodded affirmatively. "Finally someone who stays logical when it comes to this." She then stepped closer to Michelle and lowered her voice. "I could use some help for my story. My information network here isn't what it used to be since I left. In fact I can be happy for this incident taking place in another city since this gives me a head start."

Michelle gulped as she realized the implication. "You mean your story is bigger than that?"

Debbie shook her head slowly. "One of my contacts at the police mentioned that a woman who sounded suspiciously like the one from last night has been flying around here lately."

"So that's what you mean with a head start. Since the incident happened hundreds of miles away people would expect her to be from around there. But if she get's spotted here, any witnesses will be quick to mention if it really is the same person." Michelle was surprised at how easily she managed to talk about herself in third person.

"Exactly. And if my contact is to be believed - upon which I have no doubt since last night - then there is at least one more woman with these kinds of powers out there. It's only a matter of time until that goes public and then we'll have another meteor scare going on here. I'd like to have a more funded base of information by the time this happens. So what do you say?"

Now Michelle was faced with a dilemma. Debbie was one of the few reporters that still held up Michelle's ideals, someone who wouldn't add fuel to the fire if there wasn't any valid reason for it. She wouldn't turn the story into a second meteor scare. On the other hand she was already a big part of this story. Cooperating with Debbie meant risking her finding out about Michelle’s alter ego. But then again, there were still other superwomen out there which required Michelle's attention. It would be easier to find them if she became part of the investigation.

She nodded slightly. "Just like the old times, huh?"

"Yeah, it's been a while hasn't it?"

 

 

Thanks to the big news about the plane incident, James had little to no time to get his own research going. He spent most of the morning brainstorming with other scientists about the new information brought by this incident. Thankfully it had been decided to compare the results while they were at it. James was understandably happy for the opportunity to get new input, since the information delivery had been sparse so far.

"As you can see, the subjects DNA consists of a hundred chromosomes as opposed to the usual 46. It's also been proven that the 46 original chromosomes remained unchanged. In short, the mutation basically consists of 54 additional chromosomes being added to the DNA via some kind of virus..." Prof. Harland was just reporting about things James was already aware off. "… that being said, I think it's important to quarantine every person who have come in contact with one of these individuals to prevent further spreading of this effect."

"I don't think a quarantine would be necessary. The sample of vaginal fluids I examined yesterday indicated that it isn't even sexually transferable. There was no sign of such a virus to be found although it was confirmed that the woman in question had this kind of mutation." James interrupted. He already knew that the virus in question must be part of the potion that gave Michelle her powers.

Harland's face darkened as he heard that. "That doesn't exclude the possibility of an infection through contact. What's more we can't afford to let possible infected run around freely "

"If the mutation was as infectious as you claim to be, we're already too late for quarantining them anyway. Ms. Riley works as a bank accountant, she has met hundreds of people by now that would've been infected as well."

"I agree with Dr. Thompson," Prof. Smith interrupted. "If we start quarantining people now, it will turn into a second meteor scare in no time. I don't want to mention what happens if people believe that these … superpowers could be contagious. We have to disprove this theory asap. Have everybody who gets in contact with these individuals get tested as a safety measure, but don't quarantine them. Now what can you tell us about the sample you examined yesterday, Dr. Thompson?"

James gulped. He knew that his report bore some shocking news even though it contained no information about Michelle or Amanda.

"Yesterday morning a man was found severely injured in a back alley. According to his injuries, it was theorized that they were due to a sexual encounter with a woman that was significantly stronger than him. The man is still in critical condition and the damage to his spine will probably leave him paralyzed. Since the police was already informed about the superpowered woman, they managed to secure a sample. Through this we found out that the woman in question had the same kind of mutation as Jane Doe."

"Wait a second," a female scientist that James didn't know interrupted. "If you say 'significantly stronger' are you implying that the woman was as strong as the … Angel?&quot

James nodded. "Yes, it seems there's a connection between the mutation and the superpowers." He waited a bit for the shock to travel through the entire room. James was actually surprised about how many of the scientists had not considered the possibility of a connection. "Furthermore, this morning I ran a test that confirmed that the culprit in this case is neither the 'Angel' nor the redhead that was mentioned earlier, in fact the culprit is at least partial ..."

 

 

"Asian, huh?" Detective Jacob Spencer commented on the email he had received from James Thompson earlier. "Well that kind of narrows it down." Unfortunately it wasn't half as much as he wanted it to be. He leaned back in his chair, trying to sort his thoughts. Last night’s events were all over the news, "An angel prevents a plane crash!" that's how they call it. Fortunately the crash had happened in another city, taking the media's attention along with it. But Jacob knew that this was only temporary. For several days now, this woman has been seen around town, helping people. Now these people would talk about how they had encountered this very woman. Damn, Jacob himself had a hard time not mentioning his encounter with her last night. It was only a matter of time till the media caught wind of it - if they hadn't already. The fact that there were more than one of these women out there won't stay a secret for much longer too. Jacob gulped at that thought. So far it had been possible that these women knew nothing about each other, but that wasn't the case anymore. Worst case scenario would be that this 'Angel' was the only one unaware of the other's. This was only speculation, though.

Looking back at the mail, Jacob tried to put the pieces together as best he could. So far he knew about four different individuals that were affected - as James had put it - by this kind of mutation: The blonde 'Angel', the redhead, the dead prostitute and the Asian who had fucked a man to the brink of death. Said man wasn't exactly a saint, so Jacob didn't feel that bad about it. It looked like the prostitute was the odd one here considering she died while the others showed various cases of invulnerability. Jacob shook his head as he recalled the bullet's bouncing of the 'Angel' without any effect - not to mention her simply catchin the shot he himself had fired at the wannabe rapist she had been facing. What was the reason behind the prostitute's death? Were these powers indeed temporary or was it because of her drug history? No, the drug history being cleared out of her system had caused her to overdose her drugs.

If you look at it from this way, this meant that whatever caused the mutation was the best chance for the woman to quit the drugs. Her diary even mentioned that she was on the verge of beginning a new life when she made the mistake of taking the drugs again... Maybe there was a reason behind it? Could someone have caused the mutation in order to give her this chance? The 'Angel' perhaps?

Jacob took out the prostitutes diary once again. Now that he had a valid reason to believe that this woman had super powers at one point, it was painfully obvious to spot it. The strange dream about having the best night of her life pretty much screamed as such, especially since she even mentioned 'feeling like she could fly' at one point. Jacob's heart dropped as he realized that there was no mentioning of the 'Angel' or any other woman in this passage. The only other person she described was a man - whom she described as simply unreal.

This wasn't exactly news to Jacob - he had read the last parts of the diary several times by now. But recent events made him look at this revelation in a new light. There was no doubt that the prostitute had sex with said man - that's what she did for a living - and that this man had been gone by the next day. Unharmed. Not like the man that had the misfortune of encountering the Asian on such a level. This could mean one of three things: The prostitute could be weaker than the others -unlikely- , have more control over these powers during sex -unlikely since she just got them- or the man could have been super as well - probably the one who caused her mutation in the first place.

With a loud *thud* Jacob closed the diary. So far these superpowered women had been rather attractive, bringing up the possibility that their beauty was part of their powers. The prostitute herself had looked a lot better than expected, and the Angel had been downright stunning even in the dim light of a dark back alley. By this logic, it could be assumed that a man with similar powers would stick out as well. He closed his eyes as the revelation hit him. Two nights ago - probably mere hours before the Asian had encountered her victim, he had noticed a man that did stick out in such a way. It had been when he had talked to Erika Riley in a bar. The fact that she had been connected to both the Angel and the redhead had distracted him from most of what happened there at that time, but this had been stuck in the back of his head.

Back then both Jacob and Erika had assumed that the awfully good-looking man was going for the paralyzed Asian girl instead of one of her friends because the others had probably hired him to do so. What if this guy had been this good-looking because he had superpowers? In that case it would be risky to have sex with a woman who wasn't super as well, and giving her super powers would fix that. What's more, if good looks were indeed part of the whole package, he wouldn't even need to have high standards for choosing his partner. In fact he could be deliberately choosing rather unappealing or even sick women - they would love him for the attention he gave them and eventually turn into women everybody would want to be with. Could it be that the frail, paralyzed Asian was the woman he was looking for?

Jacob cursed the fact that he hadn't seen her face. Back then he had been sitting facing the other way and it had been Erika who had seen most of it. Without a second thought, he rose from his table and made his way towards the exit. It was far-fetched but this Asian woman was probably the best lead he had. And the best way to find her was with the help of Erika Riley.

 

 

Amanda walked up the stairs of the apartment complex. She had rarely been to Erika's place before and she was once again surprised at how subpar Erika lived. Fred's sister clearly lived her life to its fullest. Considering that Amanda could afford a better place than this on her waitress' job alone, it became obvious that Erika had different priorities when it came to money. But Amanda had come to accept Erika's lifestyle - even though she herself wouldn't do it the same way. And right now, she wouldn't really be in the position to scold the other woman to begin with. After all she had hospitalized her own boyfriend. It was a downright miracle that their relationship somehow recovered through all this.

After knocking on the door, Amanda waited for a response - that didn't come. Two minutes of waiting later she began to wonder if Erika was elsewhere and took out her phone. The distinct ringtone of Erika's cellphone could be heard through the door – she was either at home or she had left the phone there. Amanda knocked the door again but there was no answer this time either. She then tried to open the door and was surprised that it hadn't been locked in the first place. Hesitantly, she entered the apartment.

Erika's flat was rather basic in appearance - just like the apartment complex it was part of. Not that it looked cheap or something, but the place really gave a more functional vibe than one would expect from a grown woman.

Looking around further, Amanda soon found Erika lying on the floor. Her heart dropped for several reasons. The way Erika lay in front of her full-length mirror didn't suggest that she had voluntarily chosen this position. What's more was Erika's outfit: A red jacked, a black skirt and matching black boots - the same outfit that the raven-haired attacker from last night had worn. The only difference was that the outfit Erika wore showed no sign of their battle. But as if to drive the point home, Amanda now spotted the original outfit scattered across the floor.Obviously it had been discarded to make room for the new outfit.

Slowly, Amanda bent down, hoping to wake up the other woman, but an even bigger shock awaited her. Erika's skin felt so cold, that Amanda's immediate reaction of checking her pulse was merely wishful thinking. She realized that Erika had been clutching her chest in her last moments. A heart-attack? Why would someone of Erika's age have a heart attack? Tears filled her eyes as she thought about it. Amanda didn't have much time to cry, though. Suddenly she noticed a movement behind her, and when she turned around, all she could see through teary eyes was the barrel of a gun. Then she heard a man's voice order her to "Freeze!"
