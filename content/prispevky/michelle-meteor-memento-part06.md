The blonde woman hovered above the city trying to find an opportunity to put her superpowers to good use. It had been just over ten minutes since she left the parking block. 
<!--more-->
Michelle sighed. She was trying to get the hostage situation behind her by finding something else to do, but once again the young woman was reminded of the fact that such an opportunity wouldn’t arise just because she wanted to.

Even though she could see the entire city from her vantage point, Michelle couldn't see all the minute details at once. If she focused on a certain place with her super vision, she naturally ignored pretty much everything else... a bit disappointing, really. Then again her super eyesight was much more than any human could dream of – not to mention that she was near-sighted in her normal form. When her gaze fell on Amanda’s apartment, Michelle remembered that she had an appointment with her best friend and decided that this was as good a time as any to drop by.  

One second was all it took to reach her best friend’s apartment. Nobody in the neighborhood was able to spot the blonde goddess who had just descended. Amanda herself was no exception, and she all but screamed in surprise as Michelle suddenly appeared in her living room. 

“Don’t startle me like that!" she said as she overcame the shock. 

“The window was open, so I figured you were expecting me.” Michelle said, crossing the arms in front of her chest, which only showcased the increased bust size she sported in her super form. “By the way, nice hair!” 

Amanda’s hair had indeed changed since the last time they met. Earlier - in her super form - she had sported flaming red hair (and a matching set of orange eyes to boot) while now it was blonde, similar to Michelle’s own. This wouldn’t be too much of a surprise considering that before Amanda had drunk the strange liquid and transformed into a super powered goddess just like Michelle herself was right now, she had been blonde too. The difference was that Amanda had been a natural brunette who had only dyed her hair blonde. For some reason her natural hair color had changed.

"Just trying a new color" was Amanda’s answer – obviously her excuse for whoever would recognize the changes. The tone of her voice made it also clear that she liked the outcome of her first transformation. 

Michelle also noticed some other smaller changes on Amanda’s body. Her best friend had slimmed down a bit, while her muscles seemed slightly more defined and her breasts a tiny bit bigger. Michelle was surprised at how well she recognized these changes as they were almost invisible. And here she had been disappointed in the limits of her superior eyesight before. The more she looked at her friend, the more Michelle became aware just how deep-rooted the changes made by that super serum had been. Originally Michelle had considered these changes to her ‘normal’ self to be purely cosmetic in nature, but her second transformation had already made it obvious that this wasn’t the case. Unlike the first transformation this one – and every transformation thereafter – had been entirely pleasurable, without any sign of dizziness or pain.  

“How do you feel?” 

“Huh?” Amanda was clearly surprised by this question. “I feel fine… I guess. Compared to this morning, I feel absolutely terrific, but compared an hour ago it sure is a downgrade. Then again I also had this habit of not keeping my feet on the ground whenever I could.”  

Michelle smiled. Earlier Amanda had been quite depressed and barely used her powers when she had them. This had been because of her confrontation with her ex-boyfriend which didn’t end too well. It seemed like somewhere along the way, Amanda had started to enjoy the upsides of having superpowers. Michelle knew firsthand that being able to fly was definitely one of them. She had no intention of touching the floor of Amanda’s apartment for now. 

“I assume that things went well with Fred?” asked Michelle. 

“Something like that. Of course he wasn’t exactly happy to see ‘super me’ again, but eventually accepted my apology. And then he told ‘super me’ that he loves ‘normal me’. Can you believe it? He didn’t even manage the slightest apology for cheating on me but then talked like he made the biggest mistake of his life to what he thought was a complete stranger.” Amanda looked sideways, clearly irritated. “The worst part is that with all his lies, I absolutely know he was telling the truth.” 

“Are you sure?” Michelle secretly wondered how Amanda could be sure that his love for her was no lie. 

“Well, he tried to. He claimed he wanted to sell his car, but I know him well enough to say that he wouldn’t do that. No, my guess is that he needs the money. Now the question is: Why didn’t he tell me about his financial problems?”  

“Maybe there was something illegal going on and he didn’t want you to get caught up in it?” 

Amanda chuckled. “That’s so cliché that it was the first thing that came to my mind as well. It sure makes sense but only for ‘normal me’. If you’re somehow threatened by criminals and have a superwoman asking for a way to repay you, you simply send her after the criminals instead of trying to get the money, right?” 

Michelle nodded affirmatively.  

“So that means he needs money for something not illegal. But why didn’t he tell me about it? I mean I was his girlfriend, why wouldn’t he trust me with his problems?” 

The situation was getting uncomfortable for Michelle. It seemed like Amanda was more offended by the fact that her ex-boyfriend had lied to her than the fact that he had cheated on her. Maybe this was her guilt speaking: it was Amanda’s fault that he was hospitalized after all.  

“Maybe that other woman knows…” Amanda was more thinking aloud than talking to Michelle right now. “But then, why would he try to make up with me now?”  

“Wait! When did that happen?” Michelle was clearly surprised. 

“I had barely transformed back when he called. He said he wants to talk to me once I feel better. He still thinks I’m sick and didn’t mention that he was hospitalized. When I’m going to meet him tomorrow, he better have a good explanation for all this. Otherwise he won’t get a second chance.” 

Michelle felt a wave of relief. Normally Amanda wouldn’t even consider giving him a second chance, something that she had been quite proud of. It would be strange for her to simply forgive Fred his faults, even though Amanda had made a mistake of her own. No, this mistake was most likely the reason he was – possibly – the exception to Amanda’s rule.

“So what are your plans for him now?” 

“Well first, I’m going to meet him tomorrow and then I’ll demand an explanation for his cheating. Hopefully he’ll somehow mention his financial problems. If he doesn’t I’ll have to rely on ‘super me’ to get this bit of information. Having a secret identity has its advantages after all.” 

“Sounds like a plan.”  

Amanda simply nodded – seemingly waiting for Michelle’s next question. A question that didn’t come. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Amanda asked a question of her own. 

“Now that we talked about my problems, what exactly was on your mind when I we met earlier?” 

“Um…” Michelle hesitated, embarrassed at how small her biggest problem seemed compared to what Amanda was going through. “Well… there’s this guy…” 




James hadn’t expected much of the dead prostitute's place and was actually surprised when he actually saw it. It was basically just one room with a tiny bathroom, and the only noteworthy thing was its relative cleanliness. Even though the whole place was a bit filthy, it was apparent that its sole inhabitant had tried to keep the place as clean as possible. If her diary was to be believed, she had only started to do so the day before she died. For the whole ride here, James had read through this woman's diary trying to find a clue about what had happened to her. The diary had been one of the few things the police had confiscated in order to solve this case. James couldn't blame them. The cause of death had been obvious, and the only mystery was the healthy look the woman sported. This raised the idea of her being a similar looking woman taking over the former's identity, but a DNA test only confused the issue further. Now James and Detective Jacob Spencer were looking for a clue as to why the dead woman somehow possessed many more chromosomes than any other human. 

The diary itself hadn't been of too much help, though. This poor woman's life had been a mess, and the diary made it clear that she had been aware of that. Whenever she was sober enough, her entries were simply depressing, trying to describe the vicious cycle her life had been. There were also entries that described her various drug trips. If the answer to her strange mutation was hidden in there, James was maybe literally searching for a needle in a stack of needles. That's why he hoped to find a clue at her place. 

"Ok, tell me. What exactly are we looking for?" Detective Spencer finally asked. "What could cause this strange mutation you've described?" 

"That's the million dollar question. I have no idea what could cause it and the only effect we've seen so far might be her significantly healthier state – which ironically killed her." 

"If that's the only effect of – whatever this is – then I'm sure everybody would want to get some of that." 

"I seriously doubt it. Too bad we won't be able to see any other effects with patient zero being dead." 

"Speaking of weird effects, do you think this is connected to the flying woman rumors I told you about earlier today?" 

"Beats me. I don't want to consider such rumors until I see at least some proof. Something like a convincing photo or something." 

Detective Spencer's cell phone suddenly started to ring, abruptly pausing their conversation. James used the opportunity to give the place another once-over. Why did this woman start to clean up at such an inconvenient moment? The original idea was that there were different women involved and the new one wanted to settle in accordingly, but this wasn't necessarily the case. Wait, maybe this cleaning session had also been caused by her improved health? The diary downright stated, that she felt great and wanted to start fresh. This would at least narrow down the moment when exactly the first effects were visible. Maybe the autopsy would give a bit more insight... 

"Really? You're not kidding?" Jacob sounded really excited about whatever was the topic of his phone call. "Alright, we'll be over there in a minute." 

"Something interesting?" It didn't look like this place contained any further clue anyway. 

"You could say that. I call your convincing photo and raise you security footage." 

"What? You mean..." 

"Yes, seems like there is a flying woman out there." 




"I can't believe this!" Amanda exclaimed. "And here I thought the strangest thing that happened today would be me going against my plan and drinking that super potion. Now I hear that you've got yourself a date!" 

"When you put it that way, it really sounds embarrassing," Michelle answered. She was sitting cross-legged on Amanda's couch since the latter had gotten irritated by her constant hovering. 

"Well your private life wasn't much to speak of, so it's hard to believe you flirted at all, not to mention successfully and with a cute guy on top of that. I just can't imagine you taking the initiative." Amanda paused for a second. "Not in your normal form at least. You sure you weren't super?" 

"Absolutely, I transformed back just half an hour earlier. But the real problem is his occupation. This guy tracked me down by the pajama pants I wore during my first transformation. He might actually figure out about my powers. What am I going to do about that?" 

"Just be yourself and determine whether or not you love him. If you do, and he loves you too, then you should tell him asap." 

"Why asap? Shouldn't I wait until I'm absolutely sure that he won't put me into some government lab to be experimented on?"  

"The longer you wait to come clean, the higher the chance he'll see through it and the more he'll be pissed off when he does. Trust me, I speak out of experience." 

"So not only do I have to correctly judge his character, but I'm also operating on a deadline? Great, now I'm really anxious about the whole deal." Still, a part of her couldn't wait for the date. 

"Isn't that exactly what dating is about?" said Amanda. "By the way, you're doing it again."

Michelle looked down and realized that she subconsciously had begun to float again, now hovering a few inches above the couch. 

"What's the matter with you? Yesterday you had no problem with me flying, but now you're all 'keep your feet on the ground!'" 

"Um... well," Amanda started to stammer. Yesterday she had been clearly intimidated as well as fascinated by Michelle's display of power. Right now things were different with Amanda being annoyed about it, but Michelle had a feeling, she already knew why. After all, she hadn't been as intimidated by Amanda's super form when she had shown up at Michelle's place earlier, though Amanda's lack of confidence had helped as well. 

"Ok, I admit it," Amanda finally blurted out. "When you made me fly yesterday it didn't feel that good. But now that I know how great it feels to fly under my own power, I can't help but want to be super, too." 

"And what's keeping you?" Michelle asked. "You do have a few doses of the potion here, after all." 

“I don’t know. It kind of feels weird to transform again after what happened the first time.” Amanda’s head sunk lower.  

The sight of her friend being trapped between her desire and her guilt somehow reminded Michelle of the hostage situation from before.  

“Hey, let me tell you a bit about what happened before I got here...” 



Neither James nor Jacob believed their eyes, as they watched the security camera footage. Just as the rumors said it was a blonde woman in a black leotard, and she was clearly flying as she approached the bank robbers who had just abandoned their hostage. James cursed the low quality of the footage. In times of high definition and 3D, he was watching one of the most important discoveries with neither sound nor color. Now the first one was knocked out and the other two would use their guns to deal with her - only to find out that she's bulletproof. Then one of them would try to punch her and break his hand in the process... This wasn't their first time watching the footage, and James had already memorized what would happen next. It still was hard to believe that this really happened. 

This blonde woman could fly, was bulletproof if not downright invulnerable and the way she one-punched most of her enemies as well as squashed the hand of her current enemy left little doubt that she was far stronger than she looked. James remembered the strange findings he had been confronted with in the mountains yesterday. Had she been the one who had moved that boulder? Was that crater her doing as well? It sounded all too plausible. This woman clearly could do all of that, so James was tempted to close this case merely assuming it was her. After all, this woman was a big enough mystery on her own, so he didn't need some small fry like a moved boulder on his mind. How could this woman do the things she did? What else could she do? Who was she? What are her plans? So many questions, and he didn't even know what the hell she said to the last criminal before openly demonstrating her flight powers... 

Since they couldn't figure out anything new from the video, they quickly left the room before the other policemen in the room would start watching from the beginning. It had only been a rumor before, but the fact that there was something like a real-life superheroine out there attracted the attention of the whole department. 

"We managed to shoo off the media this time, but it's only a matter of time until this goes public." Jacob didn't seem too happy about it as they walked towards his desk. "So, do you think she's connected to the prostitute?"  

James couldn't dismiss the question this time. Both the prostitute and this blonde goddess were definitely remarkable in their own light, but this didn't necessarily mean they were connected. 

"I don't know," he began. "It's a bit strange that the one woman dies of something she would've shrugged off and another only gives a weird wicked smile after being shot." 

"Maybe it's a temporary thing? Like a drug trip but with super powers instead?" Jacob made a good point here.  

"This sounds plausible. If I remember correctly one of last drug trips in the diary describes her 'feeling like she could fly' or something." 

"Yeah, it was the last drug trip she wrote about, then she got her cleaning fit and then she died..." Det. Spencer lit a cigarette before he continued. "I don't like the idea." 

"What do you mean?" 

"If you were at the very bottom of society and suddenly had superpowers, would you really continue to do what you were doing? No, you'd do whatever the hell you want. So, in case there really is a superpower-granting drug out there, things will get ugly. Junkies are violent enough as they are, give them superpowers and you've got yourself a nightmare." 

It was now that James became aware of how different their jobs were. While before his cooperation with the police had been of purely investigative matter, he now saw that as a police detective Jacob had a very different view on these outrageous things. Where James was curious to know how these super powers worked in the first place, Jacob was more concerned about what could be done with them. Now that he thought about it, the fact that this woman used her extraordinary abilities to help others made her all the more sympathetic.  

"We need to find her," James concluded. The problem was that he had absolutely no idea how. 




Amanda had listened intently to Michelle’s report concerning the hostage situation. She had become really excited at the part, where the last criminal had brought the hostage back into the game, catching Michelle completely off-guard. Her friend had managed to intimidate herself out of this mess, saving the hostage’s life in the process.  

“What was your Plan B?” Amanda finally asked, both amazed that her friend had come up with not one, but two plans in this situation and concerned why Michelle seemed to avoid explaining this Plan B. 

“It’s quite simple actually,” Michelle answered. “Try to guess it first.” 

"Easier said than done", Amanda thought, as she tried to think of a way how to clear a hostage situation with the powers she knew of. So far they hadn't discovered anything that could be used to cover the distance and their super speed didn't work the way it did in the comics, making it impossible to catch a bullet after covering this distance. Well, technically she wouldn't even need to catch the bullet if she could only establish skin contact before that bullet hit...  

"Whoa," Amanda's trail of thoughts was disturbed by a strange tingling sensation above her right ankle. First she thought some kind of insect was trying to crawl up her leg, but then she recognized the sensation as the super energy that had coursed through her own body not too long ago. She looked at her leg to spot … nothing. She took a closer look, and felt the spot and there it was: I tiny, almost invisible thread stuck to her leg and connected it - unsurprisingly - to Michelle's own.  

"You friggin' genius," Amanda exclaimed. "You used your costume to establish the necessary skin contact to share your invulnerability with the hostage!"  

Michelle nodded affirmatively. "Too bad we don't know just how invulnerable we can make others. After all I couldn't give you the same level of strength I have, so it may be possible that a bullet could still be fatal. But I'm surprised that you found this tiny thread right away."  

"It's more like I felt the super energy than the thread itself."  

"Really? I didn't even share any of it with you. Funny, yesterday you wouldn't even recognize it, when I did. Now the whole power sharing thing seems to work completely different on you."  

"What kind of differences are we talking about?"  

"Before, I could just give you whatever power I wanted, but I had to choose it beforehand. It wasn't possible to just give you the energy for yourself to choose - you just couldn't handle it. Right now, it feels like things are inverted. I can't just give you a certain ability since you somehow deny it. And I have the feeling that if I gave you the raw super energy, you could use it to your own liking." 

"And probably transform into my super form along the way," Amanda added. She was sure Michelle had considered this possibility as well and refrained from just testing it out because of that. Amanda also considered the possibility to simply deny any kind of energy Michelle wanted to share with her. But right now she doubted she could bring herself to deny anything her friend would offer her and was glad that Michelle didn't tempt her. Still, the fact remained that Amanda had much more say in the manner compared to yesterday. Drinking the potion had caused more permanent changes than just her appearance. Amanda remembered Michelle's transformation and compared it to her own. Her own transformation was much more painful... 

"Say Michelle. Do these transformations differ from time to time?" 

"They're happening faster. And more parallel instead of having one wave after another." 

"And the pain? You didn't seem to be in half as much pain as I when I first transformed." 

"Because I wasn't. The first transformation was the only one that was painful at all... I kind of regret that I didn't watch your transformation."

 

"Why's that? Did you think I couldn't handle a bit more pain?" 

"To be honest, I'm curious to see the transformation happening to someone else, especially since I can see the super energy itself. And since the first transformation seems to be the most important one..." 

Michelle had a point; her improved senses could have given her a new insight on what this stuff actually did to them. And since she had transformed alone, this insight couldn't be gained anymore. Well, technically all it would take was another person to drink the potion, but Amanda didn't like the idea of causing permanent changes in anyone else as long as they didn't know the complete scale of those changes. Not to mention the fact that whoever took the potion might cause much more harm than she herself had caused. It was a good thing that Michelle and not someone else had found that seed. But what if there was someone else?  

"We need to find out as much about this stuff as possible," Amanda exclaimed, rising from her chair. "I may have thrown away the chance for you to see my first transformation, but I sure as hell can show you my second one." 

"So you want me to try to give you enough super energy to cause a transformation?" 

"No, we'll try that one later. For now I'll just drink the potion while you concentrate on what's happening there." 




Michelle silently watched as her friend left the room and wasn't surprised that Amanda returned holding only the two vials of super serum in her hands. It also wasn't much of a surprise that Amanda had used the opportunity to undress completely as her clothes would be as unable to contain her super form as Michelle's pajama's had been when she transformed two nights earlier. What did surprise her was her friend’s sudden decision to transform. Amanda’s determination could only mean that she had a plan. She always liked to plan ahead as she had proved yesterday when she had tried to plan Michelle’s superhero career as well as earlier when she had talked about her plans as to how to deal with Fred. 

The downside was that Amanda was bad when it came to changing her plans on short notice. There was one time in college where she failed a certain exam because of the professor’s warning to be prepared for everything. Naturally Amanda had tried to learn as many genetic sicknesses as possible while the exam concentrated on one specific sickness that happened to be the one the professor specialized in. While Amanda did know the basic parts about this sickness, the exam required much deeper and – in Amanda’s opinion – useless knowledge, so she failed it. Amanda had called him out on that, but he only retorted that in order to be successful one had to specialize. Even though he had a point, Amanda couldn't accept the fact that he specialized in a sickness that only applied to a very low number of people with an even lower chance of actual healing. Then again, the most blatant example of Amanda struggling with her plans not coming together would be everything that happened since yesterday. 

"So, um ready for the show?" Amanda's voice was determined, yet still showed hints of insecurity. While it sounded simple and logical that Amanda transformed so that Michelle might actually get some insight about the transformation, it didn't lessen the awkwardness or the embarrassment of standing naked in front of her best friend with the clear intention of being ogled at.  

Nodding slightly, Michelle concentrated on her friend. Once again she was mesmerized by the many tiny changes in her 'normal' appearance. Michelle activated her X-Ray vision and tried to get the best possible view on her friend. This was easier said than done, as she didn't know what layer and part of her body to focus on. Sure she knew what to expect during the transformation, she had felt it happen to herself several times, after all. But she didn't want to miss a thing, not when her best friend seemed to transform just for her benefit. Michelle directed more super energy into her eyes and suddenly her perception changed in a dramatic, yet favorable way. Suddenly she could see every part and every cell of her best friends body at once. Normally her X-Ray vision showed her only a certain layer, ignoring everything before and after this. Now it was like watching every layer at once, while at the same time not seeing anything besides Amanda and the vial of super potion she held in her hand.  

"My second transformation was my favorite so far, so you better enjoy yours too." Since she could practically see her best friend's nervousness in form of her fiercely beating heart. Michelle couldn't help but try to calm her friend down a bit. 

It seemed to work as Amanda's heart rate slowed down a bit. Amanda also closed her eyes and took long and deep breaths before slowly bringing the vial to her mouth. This calmed Amanda even further but Michelle, on the other hand, became more and more excited as the potion – glowing with super energy – came closer and closer to Amanda's mouth. From Michelle's perspective everything happened slower and slower, and for a fraction of a second she had wondered why. Then Michelle noticed that she had subconsciously directed more of her super energy into her brain and her whole neural system, just as she had done with her eyes. It wasn't that anything was actually moving slower, but in fact her own perception had increased to the point that everything seemed to move in slow motion.  

Finally the liquid entered Amanda’s mouth and Michelle witnessed the effects it had on her. The first thing to be transformed was Amanda’s tongue. It didn’t change shape, but it was clearly filled with the super energy. Soon her whole mouth followed suit, then her whole head. Michelle noticed that the energy spread faster than the actual transformation. From her own transformations she remembered how she could foresee the next stage of her transformation because of it. First the whole organ would be filled with super energy, then part of the energy was used to transform it into its perfected form. As Michelle watched the changes to Amanda’s brain unfold, she was surprised how simple, yet effective they were. Instead of being somehow redesigned, Amanda’s neural cells simply worked much faster than before. If there had been any structural changes, then these had happened during Amanda’s first transformation.  

Since Michelle already knew the outcome of this transformation, she was aware that the next part of her best friend would change in a much more outstanding manner. Filled with super energy, Amanda's pearl black eyes took an unnatural orange color, but Michelle saw that there were more changes than just the eye color itself. This was to be expected as they shifted into the most perceptive eyes on the planet, rivaled only by Michelle's own that casually ignored the fact that Amanda's eyes were still closed. Next was her hair. Michelle remembered how surprised she was to actually feel the changes coursing through her hair during her own transformation. Now she saw this happening to Amanda and couldn’t find any nerves inside her best friends’ hair as it transitioned from golden blonde to fiery red and lengthened down her back. Since Michelle’s eyes were able to see the otherwise invisible super energy, Amanda's orange eyes and red hair really looked as if they were on fire. This was complimented by the fact that her face had shifted as well, turning from merely beautiful to downright gorgeous. Michelle wondered why she, despite the clear differences between Amanda's normal and super faces, still could see her best friend in this exotic goddess. Well at least Amanda seemed to take Michelle's suggestion seriously as her pleasant smile showed that she was really enjoying what was happening to her.  

As Amanda's transformation moved from her head downwards her whole torso, Michelle saw, that the actual transformation didn't involve creating new body cells. Instead, there were miniature cells that simply sprang to life as they were filled – no, activated – by the super energy. It became really blatant when this happened to Amanda's breasts that started to expand almost immediately as they were flooded with super energy. They weren't actually transforming, but shifting into a more fitting form. All in all, most of Amanda's organs merely adapted to the increased size of her body and seemed to work more efficiently. This was odd. Except for the super energy that was now coursing through them, there was no hint of the powers Amanda now doubtlessly possessed. Her muscles as well, they grew to a size that would qualify as fit and toned, but otherwise there was nothing indicating the super strength they possessed. What's worse, unlike all other organs, Michelle saw that several of these miniature or inactive muscle cells didn't transform at all even when they were flooded with super energy. It was really strange, her eyes were the only part that clearly showed that the changes weren't only cosmetic in nature. But why?  

Still watching her best friend transform in slow-motion, Michelle noticed that the super energy in Amanda's body seemed to take on a slightly different tone. She couldn't really put her finger on it, but a small part of the super energy just … changed. Wait, she had seen this before. Whenever Michelle used her powers, she somehow changed the super energy into a form fitting for its purpose. And this form, tone, whatever meant that Amanda was about to fly. Sure enough, Michelle could watch her best friend slowly – really slowly from her perspective – rising on her tip-toes. Of course! This was it! The actual powers were the combination of the super energy (in a certain form) and the necessary body part, but they could be shared with others as well. So their own organs didn't actually need to be much different than normal humans as it was the energy that was important. And the muscle cells that were still inactive? Michelle remembered when she had flexed her arms after her first transformation and they suddenly swelled to body builder size. Obviously these cells would remain inactive unless Amanda needed the extra strength. The only part of the potion that affected them at all was the super energy contained within, the actual liquid did absolutely nothing. Not anymore at least, the crucial first transformation was another story. This also meant that Amanda would have transformed into her super form if Michelle had shared her super energy with her, just like they suspected.  

While Amanda's naked form slowly rose from the ground, Michelle decided to do the same and became airborne as well. She knew that her now red-headed friend was using this power subconsciously, but she also knew that she could have avoided it. The transformation was over and Amanda finally opened her eyes again. While the two floating women looked into each others' eyes, Michelle decided to bring her own vision and perception back to normal. Still, she couldn't help but notice that Amanda looked at her with a sense of awe that looked similar to when Michelle had transformed yesterday. Shouldn't things be the other way around now? After all it had been Amanda that had turned from what seemed to be a normal woman into a goddess of power right now and not Michelle. Then it dawned her: as Amanda had closed her eyes the whole time, this was the first time she could see Michelle's improved form and the super energy she possessed.  

"Wow, this was something else," Amanda eventually exclaimed. "I feel even more powerful than during my initial transformation." 

"That was to be expected. I think the first transformation itself uses up quite a bit of energy while this almost used nothing." 

"So this isn't some kind of trend where every transformation leaves you more powerful than the last?" Amanda eyed Michelle once more. 

"Doesn't seem this way." 

"Then why do you have much more of this super energy than I have?" 

"What?" Michelle had totally forgotten about that. "Well, I drank a double dose earlier."

 

"Three guesses where this excess energy is stored," Amanda said as she nonchalantly stared at Michelle's breasts. "I can't believe yours are actually a tiny bit bigger than mine..." 

"So this was your true concern?" Michelle teasingly complained. But she had to admit that Amanda demonstrated a supernatural perception here. Not only were their breasts of near-identical size and shape, Michelle had failed to notice the distribution of super energy inside her own body until now. It really seemed as if her body would house a certain level of energy and everything above this point would be stored in her breasts.

"Maybe that's because those are the only fat cells we have on our bodies," Amanda suggested, ignoring Michelle's comment. "So, did you learn anything interesting through watching my transformation?" 

Michelle began to explain her discoveries to Amanda as the latter started to create a costume of her own. It was basically a blue version of Michelle's black leotard and ballerinas. Michelle was surprised that Amanda didn't even comment on their 'costumes' simplicity but seemed more concerned on the matter at hand. She also created a pocket specifically to contain her last vial of super potion. 



"Hm, so the main difference between normal humans and us is that we can now store and use this super energy?" concluded Amanda after Michelle had finished her little report. "Well it's not a big surprise, but it's good to know. Unfortunately that also means we have no clue about what other powers we might possess. So we can only try out as many possibilities as possible." 

"Didn't we already try that? I clearly remember making a fool out of myself for an hour with zero success." Michelle recalled their trip to the mountains yesterday. 

"It's still worth a try. Now we know more about the powers and at the very least we can train the ones we already know about. And since we're both super we can even help each other with that." 

With this Amanda flew out of the still open window, in a similar blink-and-you'll-miss-it fashion she had used with Fred before. A second later she hovered over the city and looked to see whether Michelle was following her. 

"Ahem," came a voice from right behind her. Amanda turned around to see that Michelle obviously had no trouble keeping up with the empowered redhead. This gave her an idea. 

"Catch me if you can," said Amanda as she darted away from her blonde friend. She aimed at the mountain range outside the city - not only was it better to train their powers in an uninhabited area, a few obstacles would also spice things up a bit. For a split-second Amanda wondered if it was even possible for them to train their flight powers, as the control had come pretty instinctively. But as she saw Michelle closing up to her, it became clear that practice did indeed help a bit. Soon enough Amanda felt her friends arm catch her leg above her ankle. Great, now Amanda was 'it'. 

It took Amanda a while to catch Michelle in return. Even though neither of them was flying at top speed, Amanda was sure this was due to Michelle having more experience flying. After all Michelle had found out about their invulnerability by crash landing into a mountain and creating a crater while she herself had not even a scratch. It was only natural that Michelle allowed herself to fly a bit faster than her friend. Still, in order to catch Michelle, Amanda had to fly faster than even that, and eventually she succeeded. The idea of two women in their mid-twenties playing a game of tag may sound silly, and even with super powers added to the mix, Amanda wouldn't have thought of this as an interesting past-time. But that had been before she learned how great it felt to fly, to try out more complicated maneuvers while they tried to catch each other. 

The game went on for over an hour before they decided to do something else. 



"So tell me, how did you do this strange 3D-model-vision-thing you told me about?" asked Amanda as they had landed near an abandoned mine. They had chosen this place because of the many rocks and boulders lying around.

Michelle was a bit surprised by that. She had expected Amanda to just try it out, as she hadn't needed any hints from Michelle so far.

"It's a bit hard to explain. I channeled more and more super energy to my eyes and somehow it happened." 

"Ok, may I try it on you then?" Amanda asked.

Now Michelle understood why her friend seemed so reserved about this. After all Amanda would practically see everything of her. This was also the reason why Michelle hadn't mentioned how she couldn't decide on which layer of Amanda's body to focus on. It had been weird enough to mention it once. 

Michelle nodded and watched as her friend started to channel more super energy into her eyes. Something was strange about it, though. The energy was still in its original form, so Amanda didn't use her X-Ray vision. This reminded Michelle more of her earlier attempts to get a clearer view on the whole city from above which wounded up to nothing. Michelle was about to mention that Amanda should activate her X-Ray vision first, when she saw that the energy in Amanda's eyes changed. But not in the way it would change for X-Ray vision. This was something new, something that even Michelle hadn't done so far. Getting excited, she super-charged her neural system again, and watched Amanda's new discovery in slow motion.

Two beams of light came out of Amanda's eyes. Just like her eyes, these beams were orange in color, and came closer towards Michelle at an incredible speed. Even though she didn't really know how much faster her perception was at this point, the blonde woman had no doubt that they moved faster than a human eye could perceive. Michelle remembered how yesterday during her training run, Amanda had asked if she had heat vision. After several attempts, they had concluded that this was not part of the powers she possessed. Why was Amanda using a power, she herself had specifically tried and failed to use before? And what's more, why wasn't she the least bit scared that it was aimed at her? Was she really that confident in her own invulnerability, that not even another superpower could hurt her? 

She got her answers as the beams hit her straight in her chest.

The first thing she realized was that there wasn't any pain. Instead it felt good. Really good. Michelle was reminded of the burning house yesterday. The heat back then had felt nice and comforting. And now these rays were even hotter, but they also felt better. Unlike her clothes yesterday, her costume wasn't impressed by Amanda's heat vision, either. Still, it relayed the feelings of pleasure towards the breasts it covered. Having her clothes burn off her body had felt good. Being shot in her chest had felt disturbingly great. And now she was receiving a combination of both while her whole neural system was super-charged, making her breasts more sensitive than before. Caught off-guard by the intense pleasure in her chest, Michelle came almost instantly. 

Michelle dropped an one knee in utter pleasure. As her perception returned to normal, Amanda had already stopped her heat vision and was running towards her.

"Oh my god, are you alright? ... Please say something... I didn't mean to hurt you!" Amanda downright panicked.

"I'm fine," Michelle half-moaned, trying to hide the pleasure she felt right now. 

"You sure? Damn, leave it to me to screw up. First Fred and now you."

"I told you I'm fine."

Now Amanda seemed to get that Michelle wasn't moaning out of pain. Her face turned as red as her hair while she looked away in shame. 

"Ok... that's a bit too awkward." 

Thankfully it only took a few more seconds for Michelle to regain her composure.

"I didn't think heat vision meant this kind of heat," she joked, trying to make it less embarrassing.

Amanda didn't answer but instead looked at a nearby boulder. Once again two orange beams came out of her eyes, but this time Michelle didn't see them in slow motion as they cut through the boulder in question like a hot knife through butter.

"Nope, seems like the problem lies with you," Amanda exclaimed, causing both women to start laughing. At least the awkwardness was gone now.

Once they calmed down, Amanda continued. "Could it be that you've got more super energy now than before I hit you?"

Michelle gasped. "You're right."

"How did this happen?"

"Maybe I absorbed your heat vision and turned it into super energy. Come to think of it, this would also explain why I had more energy after the fire rescue yesterday."

"So you mean we can absorb heat and turn it into super energy?" Amanda asked excitedly. 

"Sounds like a convenient way to replenish our power."

"Speaking of which, do you want the power shot me with back or do you plan on drinking your second dose?"

Amanda didn't answer with words. She took out the vial, opened it and drank its content.

"Still tasty, but otherwise underwhelming," she commented as her body absorbed the energy inside the super potion. Unsurprisingly she didn't transform in any way, but stared at Michelle.

"What?" Michelle asked, realizing too late that Amanda was X-Raying her, no she was already using this 3D-Model-Vision, she had originally intended.

"You're … impressive," was all that Amanda said before letting her vision return to normal. 

"Sorry, I just needed to know if I can do it too. Now you, try to use heat vision."

Michelle did as she was told. She was sure that she had tried something extremely similar yesterday, but failed to do so nonetheless. Maybe she just wasn't able to use heat vision at all? Still, watching Amanda do it had made it really easy to grasp the concept behind it. This gave her confidence. Her blue eyes focused on the same boulder Amanda had used as target practice as she concentrated the energy in her eyes and... it worked. She could feel her vision turn into heat, and the exact spot she was looking at being disintegrated immediately.

"Cool!" said Amanda after Michelle was done.

"I think the proper term is hot," Michelle corrected her.

"Both fit for blue heat vision."

"Point taken." Seems like the heat vision always has the same color as their eyes. 

They spent a few minutes trying out their new super power. Since all they had to do to properly aim their heat vision was look at the intended target, this part was almost ridiculously easy. The challenge lay more in the intensity of the ray, as a too strong blast would not only cut through one rock, but also whatever was behind it. When they were sure that they could control their heat vision well enough to only lightly scorch the rock they used as target practice, both women agreed that there was little use in further training.

“When you look at it, this ability isn’t that useful,” Amanda began. “Best I can think of is this heating-the-gun-till-it’s-too-hot-to-hold-routine. It wouldn’t even be helpful against another person with superpowers.”

Michelle hadn’t actually considered this possibility. “Do you really think there are others with these powers?” 

“Well you found the seed of your precious plant on the sidewalk, right? Chances are that there are more seeds somewhere. So it can’t hurt to prepare for the worst case scenario.”

"People getting super powers and immediately deciding to go on a rampage because of it? I think that's a bit too pessimistic," Michelle sighed. "But then again it is the worst case scenario."

"My thoughts exactly. That's why I think it's crucial to master these powers as quickly as possible. So that you have the necessary experience to deal with any aspiring super villain." 

"That I have the necessary experience? What about you? Didn't we plan on becoming superheroines together?" 

"I did say that, yes. But what I meant was that you would become the heroine and I the sidekick that eventually emerges. This didn't change just because I drank the potion earlier than anticipated." 

Michelle was dumbfounded by this revelation. Earlier she had dismissed Amanda's belittling herself as caused by her guilt about her encounter with Fred, now she heard that Amanda had planned this even before that. But why? For years it had been Amanda who had been the more confident one, with Michelle more or less hiding behind her friend. Still, Michelle had always considered themselves to be on the same level. 

"Why does this sound like you are putting yourself below me?" Michelle sounded more offended that she intended to. 

Amanda sighed. "That's not how I mean it. I just don't think it's good for two 'super chicks' to appear at the same time. People would just get us confused with each other. So it's better for me to wait you're famous enough as a superheroine." 

"I don't even intend to become famous!" 

"Do you really think you can keep a low profile? How many people have seen you use super powers yet? You of all people should know how the media are going to react once word of a real life superheroine reaches them." 

"You have been seen as well, Fred even got a clearer view on you than anybody who saw me! You could just as well be the heroine and I the sidekick!" 

"Not when you consider what you've done so far compared to me. You went around saving people while my only action comes across as bullying at best. Even if Fred doesn't go around badmouthing me, you already have the better reputation to become the hero." 

"As I said, I'm not in it for the reputation or to be called a hero. I just want to help people and that's all." 

"My point exactly." Amanda sported a big smile as she said that. "You are aware that you sounded like the big blue boy-scout himself just now?" 

"The who?" 

"I take that as a no. That just settles that you're the optimal choice for being the hero." 

Michelle wanted to retort something, but instead, she let her head drop. Amanda had seemingly given it more than just a fleeting thought, so Michelle wouldn't be able to win this argument. 

"Do I really have to go public?" she asked. "You know I'm not good when it comes to being in the spotlight." 

"I'm not asking you to go public right now. Actually it would be stupid to do so. Eventually people will start asking about the new superheroine in town, and that will be your cue. And don't be concerned about your shyness. You literally stood naked in front of a crowd of clothed people and pulled it off really well." 

Michelle's face turned red as she remembered the incident with the burning house. She had been utterly terrified when she found out she was naked but once her strange costume powers had taken care of that, all had worked out. It had felt great to be cheered on by these people. She could get used to that. Damn, she even had used this as an argument in her strange dream last night. 

"You win," Michelle exclaimed faintly. "But as the sidekick you have to be my moral support."

"Tch, please," Amanda snorted. "This isn't the job of the sidekick. It's the job of the best friend!"

Amanda walked over to a bunch of rocks that were lying on the floor. She picked one up - it was only a bit bigger than a basketball - and held it in one hand. Michelle spotted that her best friend seemed to struggle a bit with her balance. While she was definitely strong enough to lift it, her body wasn't heavy enough for her hold the boulder as she pleased. After a few seconds of testing, Amanda threw the rock in Michelle's direction. But what was supposed to be a basketball pass with a rock in place of a ball looked unintended funny as Amanda hadn't accounted for the recoil her own throw would cause. The rock missed Michelle by several feet while Amanda fell backwards and had to use her flight powers in order not to fall over. This gave Michelle an idea.

Picking the 'ball' back up, Michelle also took her time to get accustomed to its weight. Then she used her own flight powers to steady herself while throwing the rock to Amanda. Her friend had paid attention, though and was able to catch the rock almost perfectly. The process repeated several times, with the rock being thrown faster and faster, then replaced with a bigger rock. After about half an hour, the two superwomen decided to stop this little game. Not because playing ball with rocks that could easily kill everybody due to size and speed of the projectiles wasn't fun, but the super energy they consumed was pretty high. Interestingly, they used up more energy for their flight powers than for the super strength.

As their energy began to fade, they decided it would be better to return home instead of risking an early transformation back to normal right in the middle of nowhere. Arriving at her apartment, Michelle wanted to use the opportunity to refill the vials she had given Amanda yesterday, but her best friend was adamant that one dose would be all she needed for now. While she would have preferred to have Amanda transform as many times as herself, Michelle accepted her best friends’ decision. She wouldn't have had any chance in an argument either, as Michelle didn't even know for sure why she wanted Amanda to transform more often - or at all for that matter. Still, Michelle knew that when it came to it, Amanda would support her in any possible way. Once her redheaded friend had left to return to her own apartment, Michelle began to think of all the troublesome things the future might hold for them. She couldn't really describe it, but for some reason - maybe it was the trust and support from her best friend - instead of being terrified, she couldn't wait for tomorrow.
