A lone figure rested on the pure white sand of a pristine tropical beach. She was a nautical goddess, a creature of that heretofore only existed in fantasy, a mermaid. Her long, red hair cascaded over her shoulders - the bottom of her tresses spread themselves over the damp sand of the beach. She arched her back, pushing her breasts toward the setting sun and dipped the pink fringes that dangled from the flukes of her shimmering sea-green fish-tail into the water as another wave rushed toward her.

Pat shuddered in delight as the water rose along her tail. The water felt warm and refreshing, but that had little to do with her joy. It was the way the water enhanced the unseen (to her at least) connections between her and her fellow pod mates who were swimming around in the lagoon a few meters away. She could feel the receptors embedded in her fringes along her flukes, mid-tail fins, and dorsal ridge tingle with energy as the water carried the bioelectrical signals from her pod mates to her. She was most thrilled with the connection she felt to her daughter, Maureen, who was playing with her pod sisters, Freya and Cynthia in the shallow waters. A child of her own womb, Maureen's signal nearly overwhelmed the others, sparkling with energy and color. Danni, Pat's own sister-wife, was the next strongest as she was watching the children, again, while Pat's other sister-wife, Phoebe and the trio's husband and pod leader, John, caught fish below. At least that's what they were supposed to be doing; the faint pulsing of their connections suggested that they were engaged in another activity. Pat's breathing quickened as she remembered her own love making with John earlier that morning.

Pat was relaxing for a bit. She and her more scientifically inclined counterparts had spent most of the day studying the newest behavior of their nautical sanctum - the Moon Pool. Their own presence there had apparently made the pool a change agent. The effects of their "siren cells" the mers released during their sexual encounters had altered the biology of several different species of bacteria and micro-organisms that inhabited the system of underwater caves they called home, causing these organisms to exert their own effects on any creature that entered the pool. Even as her own pod relaxed, other mers were trying to get a message to Mac Bennett and Joy Simpson to warn them that they may have been unintentionally exposed to the metamorphic powers that the Moon Pool now held on its own.

Things were changing on this little island that was, quite literally, in the middle of nowhere. But that was really nothing new. Pat scanned the beach and remembered landing there with John nearly two and a half years ago. When she first set foot on this very beach, "she" was a "he." Now, she thought as she sprayed water across her torso and face with a flip of her tailfin, she didn't even have feet to set anywhere. Not that she minded, of course, like all of her fellow creatures, she was thrilled to be a mer, and couldn't remember anything about her life before that was nearly as appealing as the life she had now.

Pat looked into the water and smiled. A school of painted shellfish swam by. It was the secretions of these gender-changing fish that Pat had first synthesized into a healing salve. She (he) and John used it to heal their wounds when they first arrived on this island. Eventually, the gender changing influences of the fish DNA made Pat into a woman, John's fantasy woman no less, and John into a specimen of ravishing masculinity. Pat's womb clenched as she remembered how the newly created couple had relished the opportunity to experience this paradise together. It was really her (or his) first romantically satisfying sexual experience.

They weren't alone for very long though. Daniel Sherman literally washed up on their beach. He was hobbled and left to drown by the henchmen of a drug lord, Malaki, who eventually became the group's unknown nemesis. To heal Daniel, they gave him the goop Pat had created, and he became Danni. Pat nearly laughed out loud as she watched Danni and their three daughters surface as they played a game of follow the leader. Yes, their small group was growing, but her smile faded as she remembered their early days on the island, before they were mers.

Refugees from the drug gang kept coming. All of them found new lives with Pat's group, and several found new genders. Michelle became Michael while Peter became Petra. They also discovered that the fish goop exacted some sacrifices from the humans it helped. The changes they experienced caused them to bond tightly into "pods" of several females to one male. If two males were alone in the company of a single female, they were overwhelmed by feelings of aggression. But if one bonded female accompanied each male, harmony was easily maintained. The new pods formed around Michael, with his former sister Gail and Petra, while Petra's niece, Phoebe, joined Pat and Danni as sister-wives to John.

When the thug Alberto and his men took over the island, things got really interesting. Confined to the water, the group noticed that they were subject to the continuing effects of the goop that each produced in their own sexual fluids. Unknown to them at the time, their bodies were already internally changing, developing new sets of organs that shaped the external changes they were noticing. Taking the fish by the fins, so to speak, it was Phoebe who thought to use the mental focus of the group to direct her changes into a mermaid. The combination of their proto-mer-organs, Phoebe's intense desire, and blind luck resulted in a miracle, a one in a billion shot that paid off in a multitude of ways. Within days, everyone had transformed themselves into the beautiful creatures they now were.

Exploiting their command of the seas, the newly created mers rescued Alberto's hostages. Their freedom came with consequences as the mermaid milk that healed them from the abuse they had suffered at the hands of their captors also set them on the road to life as mers. Of the two Chinese girls they rescued, Shou Lin took a new name, Xing, to go with her new form as she completed Michael's pod while Mai Lin transitioned to a merman, Mu Su, to lead a new pod of mermaids, identical (finally) triplets, Rikki, Cleo and Emma (who had been Martin when he walked with a pair of legs.)

Pat shuddered at the memory of the final battle. Taking back the island from the thugs had taken a terrible toll. They lost Michael to Alberto's hidden gun. The attack was too swift and devastating to give him a chance to recover with their amazing, siren-cell enriched, mermaid milk. So, he was lost, and Gail became Gabriel to lead their pod - which was soon to grow with the daughter Michael had created with Petra.

Saka and Angra, lesbian lovers held in service to Alberto, had been the key to their victory. So they were allowed to join the mers as well. Saka could not bear to be with a man, so she became one instead as the merman, Agba. To fill out their pod, they took the young man, Laken, and forcibly made him into the beautiful mermaid, Liga.

Exploring their surroundings bought more than the mers could have imagined. They discovered a sunken secret Russian submarine filled with research equipment. Far more valuable than any equipment, they located the only survivors from the sub. The pair of castaways, Russian scientists Grishna and Alexander, were at death's door from exposure and starvation. Faced with the option of certain death as humans or life as mermaids, they opted for life and took on their new forms as Galina and Alexis.

It was around this time that the visitors to the island became less victims of circumstance or people in dire peril. Sally Bennett and Eric Edwards, recently of the U.S Navy, arrived to fulfill life long dreams of becoming mers. They achieved it, but only after Agba and Angara were lost to yet another servant to the Drug King Pin. They joined with Liga and Alexis who were carrying the daughters of the now dead Agba.

Next to visit the island were the Connors family - who sought to rescue Pat(rick) and John. When they got there, they quickly found that the pair hardly needed rescuing. Hank and his wife, Janice, left the island with their daughters, Kate and Ann, but Pat knew they would be returning soon. They left their son, Robbie, and a former intern, Trevor. Neither of them would voluntarily submit to a gender change, but each wagered their masculinity on their desire to become mers. Robbie (or Rose) lost the battle, but it would be impossible to convince the mermaid that she had not won the war.

More would be rescuers arrived in the form of Bill and Mae Williams, Mae's sister, Eve, and her friends Sandy and Dawn Halbst. Dawn's cure from cancer by the mermaid milk was one of Pat's most triumphant accomplishments, although, again, fate intervened and aligned the pods in a way no one had imagined. Turi, a merciless killer, bought Tuo, Tiki and Rangi to the island in search of the drug lord's money. When Turi nearly killed the three of them as well as Sandy and Dawn, the milk's influence over Sandy and Tuo dictated that Tuo become a pod leader to the mermaids, Sandi, Dawn and Eve. Meanwhile, Bill added the honorable mermaids, the transformed Timi and Ragi, to his union with Mae. In spite of all of the changing of genders and forms, Turi experienced the most profound change yet - as the mers changed him into Tutu, a female dolphin.

Finally, with Tuo's help, Shen Chin was able to free her sister, Lin, and several others from forced prostitution at the hands of Shen's, former boss, the drug kingpin, Maliki. Shen and Lin formed yet another pod with Tuo's formerly disabled brother, Wong, and the French beauty, Esmee. At nearly the same time, Joy called an old friend, a former Navy SEAL, Mark, to lead another pod populated by African beauty Binah, the nearly transsexual Trixi, and (perhaps the most damaged of all the proto-mermaids) Homa. Pat hoped that the love of her pod mates would heal those parts of Homa's being that the mermaid milk couldn't quite reach. Shen also delivered Maliki's misogamist son, Manalo, to the island. He would not be allowed to experience the joy of becoming a mer. Instead, he paid for his past transgressions by joining Tutu as another female dolphin, Mumu.

Pat sighed as she recounted everything that had transpired over the last two and a half years. There was never a dull moment on this island; that was certain. Danni surfaced again a few meters off shore, giggling loudly. It seemed her constant tickling and playing with the girls had come back to haunt her as she was now being assaulted in a tickling frenzy by a trio of young mermaids.

"I could use a little help here," she cried out between fits of laughter.

Pat giggled and twisted her body back into the water, feeling the warm sea enfold her with its warmth. She concentrated on her swim bladder and sank beneath the surface, and then she flipped her shimmering seagreen tail to propel herself into the group. With her arms stretched wide, she pushed herself between her nieces and wrapped Maureen, Freya, and Cynthia in a warm hug.

Then, extending her fingers to her sister-wife's ribs, she said, "I think they could use some help instead," as she grinned and began to tickle Danni too.

Joy Simpson, former CIA field agent and now an emissary for the mers, stretched in the hotel bed, reveling in the softness that surrounded her. Even as she enjoyed the luxurious bed, her heart skipped a beat as she thought of returning to the sandy beaches of Mermaid Island. Well, six-hundred-thread-count linen was softer than the sandy floor of a tropical beach hut she decided, but it wasn't as exciting. She couldn't wait to return to the island, but there was lots of work to get done before that could happen. She sighed, and then looked over to the French doors, admiring the bright and bustling city below their penthouse room. A snort from behind her brought a smile to her lips. Mac Bennett, soon-to-be-retired Navy Admiral and father to one of the new mermaids, was still asleep.

That old plane really ought to be junked, she thought to herself, feeling her bones snap and crack as she stretched again. Well, if they were lucky and good, it would only have to make one more trip back to Mermaid Island, but not for a bit yet. She rose to a sitting position, feeling her breasts swing on her chest. She looked down, and saw that they seemed perkier this morning than they had for a while. She pushed her long, gray-white hair away from her face and stretched again, finally getting her right shoulder to pop.

"Ah, at last," she groaned softly.

She worked her shoulder for a few minutes, flexing it and trying to get it loose. She had dislocated it several times in her line of work, and it was one of the reasons she retired. It was not a good idea to have a slow gun arm if you were a secret agent. She rose from the bed to admire the view from their hotel. Beyond their private balcony, the morning sun was still only a half-circle of orange in the east, but the busy Hong Kong harbor was already filled with the sounds of birds, boats, and bustling people. Joy leaned her slender frame against the door and let the cool, morning breeze wash over her.

"Now that's what I call a great view," Mac said as he rose, groaning, from the bed. "Oh, my back," he said as he awkwardly rubbed his spine.

"Not too bad for an old woman, eh?" Joy asked.

"Not too bad for any woman, I'd say," Mac said as he tried to twist his back into a position of relief.

"Here, let me help you, old man," Joy teased as she walked behind him and took his arms into her own. She put her knee in the small of his back, and pulled back on his arms, popping his spine.

"Ahhh," he said as the cracks echoed through the room. "How do you do that?"

"Practice," she said. "Now, get in the shower, we have a lot of work to do before we radio back to the Island at noon."

"Slave driver," he said, turning for the bathroom. "You know, I'm still officially on vacation."

"From the Navy, but not from me," Joy said. "Besides, the Navy doesn't pay as well as I do."

"It's Hank and Janice's money, not yours," Mac said as he stepped into the shower. "And we are using it, not getting it."

"I wasn't talking about money," Joy said, opening the shower door and slipping in with him.

The large, luxury shower could hold at least four adults, and a built in bench could seat two or three people comfortably. Joy brushed past Mac and stood under one of the four shower heads that were all going at once.

"I was talking about this," she said as she grabbed his slowly stiffening cock in one hand.

"Easy, you're going to wear me out," he said, stepping close to her.

"Two days of flying! One in a heap of bolts and metal that shouldn't be able to fly, and then the long flight from Port Moresby to Hong Kong in an overcrowded Chinese jet," Joy said, slowly stoking Mac's cock. "That is what wore you out, not my feeble efforts."

"Your efforts are anything but feeble," Mac sighed, giving into her ministrations. "What work is it that we have to do today?" he asked yawning.

"We are supposed to meet with my Chinese scientist contact, some government officials, then find a short wave radio to talk to the mers, and then visit an old friend of mine," she said.

"Old friend?" Mac asked.

"You'll meet him soon enough, and he will be most disappointed to meet you," she answered, smiling as she tugged on his slowly stiffening cock.

"How do you manage to stay so good looking and horny?" he asked.

"Trade secret," Joy whispered as she licked his neck.

"Is this old friend part of how you stay good looking and horny?" he asked, leaning back against the shower wall, letting his cock fully rise. "God, Joy ... you make me feel ten years younger."

"Getting old is not for sissies," she answered. "So, I have refused to age. As far as horny goes, I've always had an active sex life. It goes with the territory of being a field agent. But Mike is just an old friend, seriously."

"Don't tell me any more than I need to know," Mac said. "I'm just glad we finally got together, forty years late."

"Don't worry about the past," Joy said, sliding down to her knees, rubbing his cock on her cheek. "Soon we won't have to worry about time."

"What do you mean?" Mac asked, as he felt her soft cheek caress his cock.

"When we finish settling up with Uncle Sam, and return to Mermaid Island," she said, as she kissed his cock head, watching it twitch.

"What will we do when we become mers?" Mack asked, as he looked down at his old friend of the past forty years.

"A lot more of this," she said as her mouth enfolded the head of his cock, her tongue swirling around the tip.

Pat watched Maureen carefully as her two week-old daughter swam with her sisters Cynthia and Freya. The little mermaid was already an accomplished swimmer, and she was making nonsense noises as she played with her sisters. Her Kelly-green tail flashed as she twirled around Freya, bumping into her pale blue sister in her excitement.

"They're just playing," Pat assured Danni. "Freya is fine, and she's giggling too."

"It's so crowded," Danni said, frowning. "Why does everyone have to be in the Nursery Cave today?"

"First," Pat reminded her sister-wife, "not everyone is here. Trevor and Rose are surveying the two islands south of here and won't be back until tomorrow. Second, all the other boys are out with Mark and MuSu experimenting with some tactical formations and hand-to-hand fighting, and so none of the mermaids can be near them, or all havoc will break loose."

Both Danni and Pat shared a giggle as they remembered the look on John's face after he got back from Mark's first attempt to organize a mer-navy the previous day. Mark hadn't expected the chaos that erupted when his girls arrived unannounced in the lagoon as he and the other mermen practiced hand-to-hand combat and stealth swimming. The practice became all too real after Homa shouted her encouragement to Mark as he grappled with MuSu. Eric had tried to calm down the combatants but soon found himself just as aggressively entangled with Mark and MuSu as they were with each other. John saved the day by ordering Mark's girls to leave double quick, and once the mermaids were far enough away, the fracas between Mark, MuSu, and Eric melted away. It was a comparatively painless reminder that mer-bonding and merman-physiology were powerful forces that no mer could ignore.

"Finally," Pat continued, "we are trying to calibrate the sensors in the Moon Pool so we can establish benchmarks of transgenic activity in the pool when we aren't there. That process should take another hour or so, right Galina?"

"Yes," she answered, checking a small transceiver she had on a silver chain around her neck. "We should have something to tell Joy and Mac when they radio later today."

"Excellent," Pat said.

"Transgenic?" asked Binah.

"Oh, sorry," Pat continued. "It means morphing or moving genetic characteristics from one species, such as the painted shell fish from which I distilled the original healing salve, to another, such as ours when we became mermaids."

"Or moving genetic characteristics across kingdoms, like bioluminescence in fish that we changed into bioluminescence in the sea grasses to illuminate our caves," Galina added, as she helped corral Michelle so Petra could examine a dark spot that had developed on her daughter's left pelvic fin. "Those sub-routines on new sensors we made will take most of another hour to cycle through."

"Is that what Mark and John were working on?" asked Trixi, remembering the strange system of pulleys, wires, and cages that they had rigged up the day before.

"Yes," Pat answered. "Each one of those tiny cages has different tissue samples from several different species, some skin from both John and myself, and even some human samples."

"Where did we get human tissue?" Trixi asked.

"Some of Homa's hair that was in a brush on the boat," Pat explained with a smile towards the beautiful Iranian mermaid. "She had an awful lot of hair."

"Has," Homa said, shaking her long, thick, tresses, the tight curls shinning in the dim light of the cave.

"We will see what the micro organisms do to each of the samples, and try to predict what the Moon Pool might do to anyone who wandered in," Phoebe explained. "In the absence of any influence from our mer-organs, which is why we are all crowded in here."

"I'm just worried that in the crush of all these mermaids our little ones will get hurt," Danni worried.

"I would be more worried about the adults than the children," Petra said as her daughter thrashed her multi-colored tail, determined to return to the pool with the other babies to play. "Will you hold still, please?" she asked her uncooperative child.

Galina and Petra held Michelle gently as Petra stroked the dark spot on Michelle's lavender and black fin. "I think it's just another mottle, like the rest of her tail," Galina said, examining the fin closely.

"Our daughter's tails are changing their coloring?" Petra asked.

"Probably," Galina said. "Human children are born with hair one color and it changes as they get older."

"Eye color changes," Pat said. "And freckles, all kinds of things change as humans mature, actually. There isn't any change in the texture of her fin, is there?"

"No," Galina answered, stroking it lightly, which caused Michelle to erupt in a fit of giggles. "Does tickle?" she asked rhetorically as Michelle squirmed and laughed.

Petra released her wriggling daughter, and Michelle slithered back down her mother's long tail into the water. She raced to join the younger children who were all swimming in various patterns and circles in the wide pool. All six tiny mermaids slowly swooped in front of Esmée, Lin, and Shen who floated at the exit tunnel, guarding against a baby breakout. They were all swimming together; Mari was in the lead now, keeping a slow enough pace for the newest mermaids. Other than Wong's girls, all the other mermaids were lounging along the edge of the pool, enjoying the soft blue-green glow of the bio-lights, and some were braiding one another's hair.

"They don't seem like infants to me," Homa observed. "They act more like children. Are you sure they are only a few weeks old?" Homa teased.

"Only three of them are that young. Ours," Pat said sweeping her hand past Danni and Phoebe, "are only two weeks old, Mari, Liga's daughter, is six weeks old, and Michelle, the oldest, is nearly four months old."

"I know that to be true, but it still seems impossible," Binah said. "They all move like one or two year old children."

"Mermaids are born with greater physical maturity than humans," Phoebe explained, smiling at her sister-wife Pat remembering their bet. "Human babies start crawling between six to eight months, and walking anywhere between their 12th and 24th month. Mermaids are born able to control all their limbs, which makes them much more developmentally advanced, compared to their human counterparts. They were also in the womb two months longer, which is actually a huge difference. We expect that all aspects of development will be quicker in mermaids as compared to humans."

"How much quicker?" Binah continued.

"We don't know for sure," Pat answered. "But we suspect that adolescence will commence in their seventh year, which is about double the speed of human children."

"Oh," Binah said, pondering this new information. "But we will all have very long lives? That doesn't make much sense. Usually species that develop quicker have shorter lives."

"You're right," Pat agreed. "But there are several reasons for those differences, the most important of which is the siren cell's ability to change, rebuild, or destroy cells."

"What's it like?" Trixi asked, interrupting, as she wove another set of seashells into Binah's hair. "Having a baby?"

"Which part?" Petra asked with a smile. "The making of or the delivery of?"

"I think I've already got the making of down," Trixi said, blushing and studiously focusing on the next shell she was weaving into Binah's shiny black hair.

"No, you don't," Petra told her, her particularly large chest swaying impressively as she shook her head. "You have no idea."

"Conception is something more than the sex we've already been having?" Trixi asked.

"Oh, yea," Pat agreed. "It's everything you've already experienced and a bag of chips."

"No one says that anymore," Cleo chided, working her own set of shells into Emma's long, chocolate hair.

"Whatever," Pat said with only the slightest trace of annoyance. "You get the picture."

"How do you do it ... um ... conceive?" Homa asked.

"You have to be careful, because it's something that is very easy to do," Pat warned. "While you're making love with Mark, you have to look deeply into his eyes and imagine the eye color of your child."

"You just picture their eyes, that's all?" Trixi asked.

"Yes," Petra answered. "But the orgasm is unlike anything you've ever experienced.

"What?" Homa protested. "Better than we've had so far?"

"Yes," Xing added. "You will pass out from the pleasure."

"Seriously?" asked Trixi, her own chest heaving as she imagined Mark drilling into her, making a child within her newly formed womb.

"Definitely," Pat said. "When you set the trigger, as we like to call it, your birth canal will trap your pod-mate's cock within your body, insuring a pregnancy."

"Oh my," Homa said, looking at her own belly.

"How does the eye thing work?" Trixi asked.

"You have noticed how the patterns of refraction in mer eyes is much more complex and reflective than normal human eyes?" Galina asked.

"Yes, our eyes changed when we became mers," Homa said, turning to gaze into Trixi's brilliantly blue eyes. "I think yours are the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."

"Thanks, Homa," Trixi said, her own eyes misting with emotion as she gazed at Homa's equally bright, intense, hazel-gold eyes. "I love you."

"Well, our new eyes have six different receptor cones instead of the human three, so we see color in greater detail. We also have a higher concentration of rods, which gives us excellent night vision, and a larger ciliary muscle around the lens that greatly improves how far we can focus," Galina continued. "We also have our new mer-bioelectrical network that reaches into our eyes. When we gaze into our merman's eyes with the intent to conceive, our pupils dilate and the same bioluminescence we can see in our tails is generated in our retinas, only it's a very small pulse of energy. His eyes then respond with a slightly bigger flash of light, and that flash of light in his eyes triggers a hormonal release in our brain which then triggers the conception contraction."

"Conception contraction?" Trix asked.

"Remember how intense your orgasm was when you first became a girl?" Pat asked.

"Oh, yes," Trixi said, the blood rushing to her face and chest as she remembered the first time Mark made love to her while Homa and Binah held her upper body in their laps. "It was the most wonderful thing that I've ever felt."

"And then the first time as a mer?" Pat repeated.

"Yes, I was so surprised that Emma was right," Trixi nodded, her passion rising as she relived that pleasant memory. "My first mer orgasm was bigger, longer, harder, and better than the best human orgasm, and I had had several before becoming a mer."

"That's because your mer womb is bigger, longer, and stronger than human reproductive organs," Pat explained. "The hormonal trigger makes a mer muscle in your birth canal, one that normally exists in human anatomy but ours is larger, clamp down on Mark's cock, creating something like a vacuum seal."

Pat stopped for a second and savored the memory, closing her eyes, and let her body respond to the memory of those feelings. The other mothers in the room also relived their moment of conception, and the sexual tension in the room swirled around them like a rich, thick blanket.

"Um, that sounds kinda clinical, and you all are acting anything but clinical," Binah said.

"Yea, I can feel sex just radiate from your body," Homa said. "It's getting me really ... um ...."

"Horny," Trixi answered for her, weaving the last shell into Binah's hair. "God, you're beautiful," she said to her dark-skinned sisterwife.

"You think so?" Binah asked, shaking her head so that the complex hair weave that both Homa and Trixi had created, thousands of tiny braids each weighted down with a few tiny shells, slithered over her shoulders and tinkled along her back. "Keep going," she urged Pat. "I like the way this talk is making me feel."

"Mermaid physiology insures our high sex drive," Pat said, sharing a look with her pod-mates. "But it helps when your sister-wives are such wonderful creatures that you would make love to them anyway."

"We love you too," Phoebe said. "Now finish, because the children are already responding to our pheromones, and that means we need to work through this arousal." Phoebe pointed to the pool where all six baby mermaids were now curled together in a corner of the pool, asleep.

"What's wrong with the little ones?" Esmée asked as she and her sister wives surfaced. "They all just went to sleep."

"Pheromones," Pat explained, stroking her own body as she talked. "When mermaids have a strong sexual response, like feeding for transition or even just regular sex fantasies, we release very powerful pheromones, and immature mermaids respond by falling asleep. Mermen, on the other hand, can barely contain themselves."

"Us adult mermaids feel it too," Danni said, pulling on her own breasts as she stroked her golden flukes along Pat's sea-green tail. "Finish explaining, damn it, so we can get going."

"Sorry," Pat said. "Anyway, because the vaginal contractions trap the male's penis inside you, neither one of you can move, and so your conception contractions start. Normally the muscles around your birth canal, in both humans and mermaids, contract during orgasm. Those contractions can be larger in some women than others, and some women barely feel it at all. As far as we can tell, all mermaids are very conscious of their G-spot and vaginal muscles."

"G-Spot?" Homa asked, her chest starting to tighten as her horniness increased.

"A cluster of nerves on top of the vaginal canal a few inches inside your labia," Pat continued, pulling on her own breasts as everyone's arousal continued to grow. "The hormonal release caused by the eye flash triggers these nerves, which also triggers our ovaries to release one egg, which is why we don't menstruate. The conception contractions are a result of signals from our bottom bioelectrical mer-organ that cause those muscles to rapidly and repeatedly contract in a pattern that mimics the stroking that your merman would be doing if he could."

"If his cock wasn't trapped inside you," Phoebe added, pushing and pulling on her own breasts, forcing her mermaid milk to arc through her fingers, spraying Pat and Danni with her sweet, warm, milk.

"Ah," Pat moaned softly as one Phoebe's multiple streams of milk crossed her face. "Feels nice."

"What happens after he cums?" asked Trixi, as she watched Mae, Tumi and Ragi fall into a tangle on the other side of the pool.

"None of us remained conscious after our pod-mate ejaculated into our womb," Danni said, her own long nipples fully erect, pointing out into the cool air of the nursery cave like javelins, Phoebe's milk oozing down along her shoulders and breasts. "And it takes a while for your vagina to relax enough so that your mate can withdraw. When I woke up, John was still trapped inside me," she finished, her face and chest flushed with the memory of her conception of Freya.

"Wow," Trixi said, noticing that Sandi, Dawn, and Eve had stopped listening and slid into the water together.

"So, why isn't everyone pregnant?" Binah asked, her own ebony chest rising and falling as she struggled to contain her passion.

"I don't know," Pat said. "You'll have to ask the ones who are not yet mothers."

Trixi turned to where Emma had been sitting behind her, to ask, but saw that the triplets were locked in a jumble of arms, hair, and blue & white tails as they squirmed against one another.

"That answer will have to wait," Trixi said as she pulled Binah into a kiss, pressing her body against the length of Binah's dark torso, her bright blue and yellow stripped tail entwining with her sister wife's dark red, orange, and black one. "We seem to be the only ones left not having sex," she panted as she looked around the room.

Homa looked around the room and saw that everyone was now entwined in groups of three, and the room was filled with moaning, giggling, and the wet sounds of vents being opened and pumped by mermaid fingers and tongues. She looked down at her pod-mates and stroked her sister-wives' hair and hips as they writhed against each other, watching them as they brought one another to a shattering shared climax. Then she giggled as they both pounced on her, pushing her back into the soft sand of the Nursery Cave floor, showering her body with kisses and caresses. One of the wonderful things about her thicker head of hair, she thought to herself as Trixi and Binah stroked and kissed her torso and tail, was that she felt like she was laying on a thick, luxurious, silken blanket. Around her she could hear the other pods moaning, squealing, and yelping in pleasure as the mermaids satisfied their extraordinarily high sex drives. She gasped as Binah slipped her hand inside her own wet vent, twisting its way up her now longer birth canal, causing her fiery red and orange tail to vibrate against floor. She started to moan, but was cut short by Trixi's breast which had been shoved into her mouth.

Homa drew a sharp breath of air through her nose, and then formed a tight suction around Trixi's swollen nipple. She could taste the sweet mermaid milk as it sprayed into her mouth. Binah's hand twisted inside her belly, and she gave into the mounting waves of her orgasm, letting her body ripple and twitch in pleasure. When she was finished, Binah withdrew her hand, and the three of them shared a kiss.

"You're always so easy to set off," Binah teased, her own ebony skin splattered with droplets of her own and her sister-wives' mermaid milk.

"I'm just glad that I can enjoy sex again," Homa sighed, stroking Trixi's face. "I didn't think I would ever have another orgasm when I was back ... "

"Don't!" Trixi interrupted. "That life is over."

"Yes," Binah agreed. "This life is our life now."

"Our life," Homa said softly, still quivering from her orgasm. "Life ... our new mer-life."

Abao Dimaunahan, the second son of Malaki Dimaunahan, leaned forward in his chair, looking across the table at Michael Thomson, the owner of Thomson Marine. Thomson watched Aboa's left eye twitch as he waited for the small Malaysian man to make his next move.

"Are you sure you have no more information?" Abao asked as he pushed a thick envelop across the table. "My father is most anxious to find his beloved first son, and the people who kidnapped him. I am sure my father does not want to believe that you had anything to do with helping them."

Abao leaned back and straightened the silverware around the faceplate that had the now anachronistic Hong Kong Royal Yacht Club insignia in the center. He was trying to imitate the disinterest he had watched his father feign in so many previous meetings. Malaki Dimaunahan was an impressive man, not large or tall, but everyone who saw him immediately knew that Malaki was dangerous. Abao, on the other hand, was rarely successful in his attempts to imitate his father, and was unaware of his failure to do so.

Michael Thomson brushed his graying hair off his forehead, and took another sip of wine. He knew who Malaki Dimaunahan was, and had sold him at least ten yachts in the last fifteen years. He also remembered Manalo and Abao from when they were little boys. Abao looked and acted less like his father than Manalo did, though there was something obviously wrong with Manalo when he saw him a little over three weeks ago. He was especially annoyed because Abao had interrupted his lunch and was going to make him late for his highly anticipated meeting with an old friend.

"Keep your envelope," he said firmly. "You have all the information that I do, and I do not appreciate your implied accusation. Give your father my best; I will certainly be sharing my thoughts with him concerning this meeting. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must return to the marina."

"I visited your marina this morning," Abao said, stopping Michael midrise. "It is such a beautiful marina. So clean," he said sweeping his hand over the view.

"Yes, it is," Michael said evenly.

"It would be a tragedy if anything happened that made a mess of it," Abao said sweetly, pushing the envelope towards Michael one last time.

"Yes, it would be a tragedy," Michael agreed. "But you see, I have highly trained sanitation workers," he continued with only a touch of menace in his voice, "and you should see what they did to the last people who brought trash into my marina. Have a nice day."

Abao watched Michael leave and then looked out over the harbor. Something was missing. He needed to find out more about the cripple they had loaded onto the boat. He believed that Mr. Thomson, the owner of the marina where Shen Chin, his father's former secretary, had traded boats, was holding something back, but he couldn't guess what. He saw Mr. Thomson below him on the docks, and watched him as he returned to his boat. He greeted a stunning older woman with long gray hair and another man, also with white hair, who looked like a tycoon, and the three of them went onto a very large yacht that quickly eased away from the dock and headed out across the bay towards Aberdeen.

Rich Western playboy, Abao thought to himself, not an honest, workingman like his father and himself.

The sunlight filtered down through the clear tropical water, flickering across the eight mermen floating in their favorite sand bowl, the same one in which John had first discovered Pat and Danni using their gills for the first time. This time, however, the mood was very different.

"I just don't understand why that move can't be adapted," Mark complained. He looked across the circle at Tuo, who shrugged his shoulders. All the mermen except for Trevor, who was off on a surveillance mission with Rose, floated in the clear water about three meters below the surface. They had been practicing various moves and "throws" as part of developing an underwater version of martial arts combat.

"Perhaps our tails are not feet," Tuo offered.

"Actually, they are." John said with a smile. "And that could be why you're having difficulty imagining how to use your tail in this move."

"What you mean?" Tuo challenged, his hand pointing down at his greatly changed legs, watching his silver and gray scales sparkle in the dappling sunlight filtering down from above. "I have one limb, and it ends in a fin. This is a tail."

"Not technically," John continued, flexing his own steel blue tail for emphasis. "We didn't grow tails, as Pat keeps reminding me, we changed our legs. If we had tails, they would be connected to our spine, and then we would have great difficulty adapting any martial arts moves to mer combat. But we didn't grow tails, we changed our legs."

"Why didn't we grow tails?" Mark asked. "I mean, that's what whales and dolphins did. They used to be land mammals. Why wouldn't our genes alter us in similar ways?"

"Well, Pat's the real scientist on this topic," John answered. "But from what I understand of the whole idea, the key fact is that we didn't evolve. We might have, if we had let time take its course, but when Phoebe realized that the siren cell could be directed or influenced by our own enhanced bioelectrical activity, we went from evolutionary biology to revolutionary biology."

"No one has ever explained this to me," Mark said. "Tell me more, maybe after I understand what happened to my legs, I can make the mechanical adaptation to my tail, " he mused as he flexed his own black and purple tail, watching his green fringes flutter in the water as he tried to imagine his toes still under all that color and sparkle.

"Well, first off, you're right. Whales and dolphins did evolve from land mammals, and they lost their rear limbs," John said, watching as the other "new" mers drifted closer in the circle in which they had been practicing hand-to-hand underwater combat. "While they still have vestigial pelvic bones, we kept ours intact. In fact, we kept most of our skeletal components of legs, knees, and feet. We just changed them to serve marine propulsion."

"Could we really have evolved real tails, like dolphins, if Phoebe didn't force the change?" asked Gabriel, remembering back to their first transformations into mers.

"Maybe in thousands of successive generations," John answered. "But we skipped the normal workings of evolution because the siren cell is part virus and part stem cell; it allowed us to both destroy and rebuild current cells in our own bodies rather than having to create new genetic traits in our children."

"No wonder the Admiral was so impressed with the power of the mers," Eric realized. "We could create monsters."

"We could," John nodded. "But we won't."

"How can you say that?" Eric challenged. "I mean, not that I want to or anything."

"Think for a nanosecond about your mates," MuSu said, joining the conversation for the first time. "Would you do anything to harm them?"

All the mers grew grave and stiff. Eric slowly shook his head from side to side.

"Right," John said evenly. "Each of us would rather die than see harm come to our girls. Soon, we will be able to easily protect them from thugs like Malaki and his sons, but how would we stop Russia or the USA if they thought mers were dangerous?"

"Or China ... oh, shit," Eric said. "You're right, I can't imagine doing anything that would bring harm to my girls. Wow, mer-bonding is really powerful. I don't know if I could even "think" these thoughts when I was a human."

"We're still human enough," John said. "According to Pat and the others. We can probably interbreed with land-based humans, though any union is overwhelmingly likely to produce a mer because our siren cell "modifies" any cell that it touches, and they would insure that mer DNA dominated."

"Even if we had sex with a human girl?" MuSu asked. "Not that I'm thinking of it for myself."

"Of course you're not," John said gently. "But we don't know. The siren cell is in our semen, and so it would probably thrive in a normal human womb and influence both mother and child. There is also a strong possibility that any sexual contact would start that human on an inevitable journey towards becoming a mer themselves."

"So, other than not creating genetic monsters to threaten humanity, how do we protect our mates from a hydrogen bomb," asked Bill.

"M.A.D." Mark offered.

"MAD?" asked Bill.

"Mutually Assured Destruction," answered Eric.

"How would that work?" Bill asked, twitching nervously. "I'm not a military man, and this talk is making me edgy."

"Most people fear things that are different from themselves, and we have become very different," John continued.

"I'd say we've improved ourselves greatly," MuSu countered.

"I agree," John nodded. "But Pat assures me that people like her own brother will likely lead the blood pack of religious crazies that will seek our deaths because we are Satan's spawn or some similar label."

"Talk about monsters," Eric said grimly.

"MAD?" asked Bill.

"Mac and Joy are contacting each of the major powers, and providing them with proof of our power to create things for good, like those anemone that eat pollution, and things for ill," John explained.

"Like what," asked Bill, growing even more nervous.

"I don't even know," John said. "Pat, Galina, Alexis, Phoebe, and Emma have all sworn sallekhana, and they have forbidden anyone else to do so for this particular reason. The only thing Pat will tell me is that they are close to perfecting the ultimate bomb, a biological time bomb that could wipe out all life on earth."

"A carrot and a stick," Eric mused. "A really, really, big stick. So, as long as we can protect ourselves from thugs and religious nuts, the major powers will likely leave us alone. We can save the world, or we can kill it."

"Why wouldn't one of the major powers try to capture us to use this power for themselves?" asked Bill.

"Sallenkhana and MAD," John explained. "Mac and Joy are going to make it clear that if anything happens to us, the entire world will pay the price."

"Sallenkhana?" asked Bill.

"Suicide caused by will or meditation," John explained. "We can shut down our own mer organs if we concentrate hard enough. The girls have tested it, and thus if they are captured against their will, they have sworn to die rather than endanger the other mers."

"I'm not sure which is crazier, Sallenkhana or MAD," Bill wondered. "We can kill the world or kill ourselves."

"But we have no weapon that will stop a bomb from wiping us all out," Mark said darkly. "Only one that will wipe out all life as a retaliation threat. That's not very many options."

"The girls are working on several lesser bio-weapons that wouldn't cause environmental collapse, but would make specific areas of the world very unpleasant," John said. "The hope is that the world will just leave us alone."

"History shows that humans have been really bad at that," Eric said.

A few moments passed in silence the mermen all pondered the difficulties they faced.

"While we wait to die, we still have our leg bones under this tail?" Tuo interjected. "Sorry to say, we must worry about Malaki and nutty Pat's brother."

"Yes, we do," Mark laughed, breaking the tension. "So, we have legs still?"

"More or less," John concluded. "We can stand on our flukes, actually. We can't walk, of course; our legs have been fused together by two new sets of bones at our knees and ankles, not to mention the scales that now cover our joined leg bones, but we can still balance and twist on those two sets of bones in much the same way we used to when we had two legs."

"And we can do things with our tails that we could never do with our legs," Eric chimed in, flexing his in the water, causing him to twirl in place.

"I can't think of what I see below my waist as my legs," Bill said. "Besides, I never knew any martial arts when I was human, so I'm not having to relearn anything. I just think of my tail as ... my tail."

"I think I understand," Mark said, a gleam growing in his eyes. "Let's go up on the beach and try a few throws, and I think I'll be able to work out the new hydro-mechanics needed once I figure out how our own bio-mechanics work on dry land."

He gave a quick hand signal, and everyone nodded. The eight mermen quickly fell into their now practiced formation, moving like underwater lightening towards the beach in a tight "V" formation, their pelvic fins nearly touching. As they neared the beach, their dorsal fins sliced up through the surface of the water as the rising bottom forced them to swim closer to the surface. Then suddenly the mermen erupted from the shallow water, arching towards the beach about five feet above the water. In perfect formation, they all hit the damp sand and tucked into a tight ball, rolling up onto the sand. Each merman's tail was wrapped over his head, stretching over and around his head, with his flukes laying flat against the small of his back, nearly even with his waist. Two or three summersaults latter, they all unrolled together, each facing a different section of the jungle, their bodies stretched out horizontally onto the sand on their bellies, presenting the smallest possible target to anyone hidden in the jungle.

Mark gave a short whistle, and everyone relaxed and rolled over to sit up. "That was the best yet," he praised his comrades. "Bill in particular; you are finally getting the hang of that tuck and roll."

"Thanks," Bill said, brushing sand from his chest. "I never thought I'd be back in the army."

"Navy," Eric corrected.

"Marines, whatever," Bill continued, "but it sure feels great to be young and healthy again."

"Well, when there are only nine mermen in the whole world, every merman gets to be in the Mer-Navy," John said.

"Now, you did this standing thing once before?" Mark asked.

"Yes, when Michael died," John said with a look at Gabriel. "We sort of felt like we had to give him some sort of tribute. MuSu and I were the only ones who actually stood all the way, the girls sort of made it to their knees."

Mark looked down at his tail, and then rocked backwards, gathering momentum. He pushed himself forward with his hands and rose up on his undulating tail. He wobbled for a second, but straightened out his tail, making it stiff, and "stood" on his flukes.

"I can feel my muscles wanting to do things they no longer can do," he said, his voice straining with the effort.

"Relax a bit," John said. "Let you body re-learn how to balance itself. You're working too hard at balancing."

John curled his own tail underneath him, and then using it like a coiled spring, rose up suddenly. Unlike Mark, John's tail was still slightly curved, but everyone could see that the muscles beneath his scales were moving less frequently than Mark's. MuSu rose up too and hopped over to John.

"The hopping thing isn't advisable on anything other than sand," MuSu said. "It really hurts on anything harder."

"Our best locomotion over dry land is still salamandaring," John added. "But who knows, it might be useful to be able to stand up in a fight."

Bill tried to rock himself up, but he kept falling over. "Damn it, what the hell am I doing wrong?" he demanded.

"Over adjusting," Mark suggested. "Like I was doing at first," he finished looking down at his now more relaxed tail, slowly flexing himself up and down and side to side, seeing where the limits of his strength and balance were. "Although we have a very narrow range of stability," he said, nearly losing his balance, "it takes surprisingly little effort to stay in our new center of gravity."

"Do it slower," MuSu advised.

Bill shot a skeptical look at MuSu, and re-curled his tail underneath him. He flexed slowly, his arms outstretched, and slowly rose straight up. "Hey, I did it," he shouted.

"Then get ready for this," Mark said with a grin, and launched himself at Bill.

"Are you asleep?" Kate Connor asked the darkness that surrounded her.

"No," came the disembodied reply from across the room that, tonight, she shared with her sister.

Kate sat up and turned on the bedside lamp, and looked across her dormroom at her twin. Kate's roommate was away visiting her boyfriend, and Ann had come up from UCLA to visit her for the weekend. They had originally thought that going to different schools might be good for them, to develop on their own, but now, over halfway through their first semester of freshman year, both regretted their decision.

Ann shared Kate's own blonde hair and hazel-green eyes, and both girls were tall and slender. They had their father's strong chin and their mother's generous smile, and the total effect was devastating, though neither girl paid much attention to the attention that they attracted. They were both wearing their standard bedclothes, a light tank top with boyshorts panties. Ann sat up too, and crossed her long, lean legs into a lotus position.

"I keep on thinking about our talk this afternoon," Ann said.

"It's amazing," Kate said. "Don't you think?"

"Yea, crazy is more like it," muttered Ann. "We've both been fighting over Trevor since we were twelve years old, and now our own brother steals him away from us."

"Not really," Kate corrected. "He just got to him first. Remember, there's three to a pod."

"Yea, I know," Ann said sleepily. "Still, it makes me crazy that Rose is out there and we're stuck here in California."

"Yea," Kate agreed. "I can't believe Dad wants us to actually go to all four years of college when he and Mom are probably going back to the island next summer."

"We could learn more from Emma and her sisters in one week than we could from four years at college," Ann said. "And none of the boys at UCLA are nearly as beautiful as Trevor."

"Same for here at Stanford," Kate agreed.

"And now Rose has him all to herself," Ann sighed.

They both looked out of the dorm window and watched the night sky twinkle.

"Remember how beautiful the Milky Way was on Mermaid Island?" Kate asked.

"Yea," Ann agreed. "It was so big, so clear. I can't wait to go back. This is nuts."

"Do you really think all three of us can be sister-wives?" asked Kate.

"Emma, Rikki, and Cleo can do it," Ann said. "We can do it."

"Yea, but they are triplets," Kate noted. "Wouldn't that make a difference?"

"Nah," Ann said. "We're twins, that's good enough."

"What about Rose?" asked Kate, crinkling her nose. "We're talkin' about our brother, ya know?"

"Yea, I know," Ann repeated. "What? You didn't like him?"

"No, I love my brother," Kate protested. "It's just, like, you know ... he's Rose now, and, I mean, who is that?"

"According to Mom, she looks like Mom and acts like Dad, just like we look like Dad and act like Mom," Ann said as she pulled her long, blonde hair forward over her shoulder as she reached for a brush.

"When did she tell you that?" Kate asked.

"Just before I came up here to visit," Ann explained. "But can you imagine a person who looks like Mom but acts like Dad?"

"Like short, dark hair, slender build, super-intense eyes, but more laid back, quiet and shy?" Kate mused. "Wow, that's weird. Hey, let me do that," she finished as she rose from her bed and crossed the room.

"Yea, weird," Ann confirmed as she handed her sister the brush and turned to face the window, looking out over the beautiful Stanford campus. She relaxed for a few minutes as she let her sister groom her.

"The mermaids do this all the time," Ann said, enjoying tug of the brush against her hair.

"Yea, but they do lots of other things too," Kate said, looking at her sister's long, vibrant hair as it flowed through her fingers.

"Yea, I know," Ann said. "I've been thinking about that."

"And," Kate said, barely breathing.

"And I don't know," Ann said lightly. "I think I'm cool with that."

"Cool with what?" Kate asked, dropping the brush to her own lap.

"With you being my sister-wife," Ann said, turning to face her sister in the bed.

They sat across from one another, cross-legged, their knees touching. They searched each other's faces to see all the swirling emotions that glimmered in their eyes, tugged at their smiles, and encumbered their breathing.

"Serious?" Kate said, her breath rising in her chest.

"Totally," Ann reassured her as she leaned forward and parted her lips, hesitation a few millimeters from her sister's mouth.

"Me too," Kate whispered as she moved her lips across the small space that separated them, and gently pressed her lips to her sister's.

They held their lips gently together, moving them slightly as they slowly deepened their kiss. Although they had kissed one another countless times in the past, this was their first kiss since they were twelve in which their sexuality was being tested. Ann moved her left arm up to Kate's face as Kate moved her left arm as well. They each cradled one another's soft face as they began to move their lips together, kissing again and again. After a few moments, they both leaned back and smiled at one another, their eyes shinning with love and affection, the smell of their shared arousal wafting upward.

"That was way better than when we were younger," Ann said, her face flushed.

"Yea," Kate agreed. "It makes me feel stronger."

"Stronger?" Ann asked.

"It felt right, you know?" Kate said. "Like we're supposed to be kissing, and supposed to become mermaids."

"Oh," Ann said. "Yea, I see that too. Can you imagine what Elena would say if she saw us kissing?"

"Don't remind me," Kate said, her mood darkening.

"What's wrong?" Ann asked.

"These walls are thin, and there is the smallest chance my roommate could come back," Kate said sadly.

"Elena is still fighting with her boyfriend?" Ann asked, familiar with the trials and tribulations of her sister's roommate.

"Yea," Kate agreed. "Tonight is supposed to be a make up, but she might come back. Even though she knows that you're here."

"I guess we can't sleep in the same bed without anyone freaking," Ann said.

"We could do that, and no one would care," Kate said, puller her sister up and leading her back to her own bed. "But cuddling only. Elena can be a real bitch sometimes, and I'd rather she didn't have anything to hold over me."

"Too bad," Ann sighed. "I have been thinking about you a lot lately, when I ... "

"Me too," Kate admitted, knowing exactly what her sister was talking about. "God, I wish Elena would just fuck him and get it over with, then you and I could really spend tonight together."

"Yea," Ann agreed wistfully. They sat for a moment, relaxed in one another's presence. "Why is it that we are still technically virgins?" Ann asked impulsively.

"Ha," Kate said ruefully. "Sometimes, when I hear Elena screaming while I'm trying to study out in the suite, I wonder if we made the right decision about waiting. She always sounds like she's having a great time."

"I'm glad we waited," Ann argued. "Think how wonderful it will be when Trevor finally makes love to us! We both can lose our virginity to him, and neither one of us will be jealous. I wonder what he looks like as a merman?"

"I bet he is even better looking than he was," Kate said, her breathing indicating her growing arousal. "God! Do you care if I masturbate?"

"What about your other suite mates?" Ann asked, as she snuggled down next to her sister. "Wouldn't they hear us? You're real loud," she giggled, remembering the many times they had masturbated together.

"Who, me?" Kate protested. "You're way louder than I am! Besides, my suite mates would only get made if they could hear us over their own screams," Kate said giggling. "They have sex with someone almost every night, and it's not with just boys."

Both girls giggled, softly at first, and then louder.

"Shuuuusch," Ann warned. "We don't want to wake your roommates up! They might want to join in," she said, choking back her laughter.

"O.K., O.K.," Kate giggled. "We both scream too loud," she whispered. "So, we wait until we're mermaids?"

"We wait until we're with Trevor and Rose," Ann said with a smile. "It still takes a day or two to actually become a mermaid, you know."

"Yea, I know," Kate said, imitating the way her sister always said that phrase. "So, our Thanksgiving break is coming up, and we have to get Mom to help us change Dad's mind."

"Yea, we do," Ann agreed. "The sooner, the better."

"Are there any volunteers?" Pat asked, as she looked around the Moon Pool. All the mermaids except for Danni, Xing, and the children had left the nursery cave and gathered in here. All of the mermaids were flushed with the after-effects of their recent sexual romp in the Nursery Cave, their eyes shinning and their tails still pulsing faintly with the lights of their recent passion. Pat, Phoebe, Emma, Galina, and Alexis had convinced the other mermaids to attempt some experiments in the presence of their sensors so that their mer-connections could be measured. They had measured their bioelectrical signals at rest, then while having sex, and now Pat wanted two mermaids from different pods to have sex so that those signals could be measured.

"I know it goes against the mer-bonds we have developed," Pat continued carefully. "But surely one of us finds someone else here attractive enough to cause that person to orgasm?"

There was silence as each of the sister-wives in the pool thought about what it would cost them to violate the deep bonds they could feel that they shared with their own pod-mates. Even those who could imagine breaking that bond had trouble imagining who they ought to pick to violate that bond with, even if it was in the name of science.

"I'll go," Phoebe said softly. "I have a debt to pay to my uncle."

Several of the newer mermaids looked up with puzzled looks.

"Oh, my niece," Petra sighed. "You owe me nothing."

"Besides you have to man your station," Pat warned.

"My station is easy," Phoebe argued. "In fact, only my station is easy, yours, Alexis', Galina's, and Emma's are in Cyrillic, and all I have to do is make sure the energy converter doesn't overheat. Anyone can do it."

"That's true," Galina agreed. "But you're related, aren't you?"

"That may be a factor, which is all the more reason for Petra and I to be one pair," Phoebe said.

"I would be with Trixi," Esmée said haltingly. "If she would have me. She did me many kindnesses back ... back ... "

"Don't speak of it," Trixi said quickly. "We do not speak of that past."

"There would be no objection," Shen said, putting a hand on her sisterwife' s shoulder. "We know of your love for us, and we know you will return."

"Homa?" Trixi asked.

"I am much healed," Homa said with a smile. "If Esmée can offer, and you can accept, we can accept." Binah nodded her agreement.

"Well, that seems to solve the problems of matched and mismatched pairs," Pat observed. "Do you want some privacy, except for the sensors, of course?"

"No!" all four mermaids shouted at once.

"I ... I ... mean," Trixi stuttered. "I want my sister-wives here, with me. It will make it safer, easier."

"Mer-bonds are most impressive," Galina observed, ever the scientist.

"They are," Pat agreed, reaching out to Phoebe and squeezing her hand. "I love you, and we all love Petra. This is for science, after all."

"I wonder how many guys would love to have THAT for a pick up line," Petra said, breaking the tension as all the mermaids laughed.

"Do you want me to send for Danni?" Pat asked Phoebe.

"No, I'll be fine," Phoebe sighed. "It will actually be easier knowing that she is taking care of both Cynthia and Michelle, right Petra?"

Petra nodded, thinking of both of their daughters playing with Danni. "Yes, it will be just you and I for our pods. Our sister wives will all be in other caves."

"We will be here for all of you," Sandi said.

"All of us," Dawn added. "This is for science, really. I want to understand why we feel the way that we do about each other."

"So, um, what do we do?" Esmée asked.

"Wait until we get back to the lab and start the sub-routines," Pat explained. "We will whistle when you should begin."

"We will need everyone but Phoebe, Petra, Trixi, and Esmée along the outer edge of the pool," Galina said. "Just like we did when we were recording everyone's individual signals. Sally, you've had plenty of experience with technical equipment, can you take Phoebe's place?"

"Sure," she said, giving a quick peck on the cheek to Liga. "If that's alright with you?" she asked.

Liga nodded and smiled, looking back and forth between Alexis and Sally. "I will be fine. I can help here."

"Good. Everyone set?" Pat asked.

Everyone nodded, and five mermaids headed down the tunnel that led to the lab cave, four mermaids moved to the center of the Moon Pool, illuminated by the late afternoon sun that trickled down from above, and the twelve remaining mermaids arranged themselves around the edges of the pool.

Mae looked to her right and smiled at Ragi, whose dark brown eyes glistened with worry. Just beyond her was her other sister-wife, Timi, who looked nearly as worried as Ragi. Mae tried to project as much love and reassurance as she could as she smiled at her sister wives. She knew that the former Polynesian men/turned mermaids were very insecure about their status, and that they depended upon their American sisterwife to explain many of the things that the other "Euro-American mermaids" said and did. Science was a particular area of insecurity, and Mae often found herself trying to explain concepts and ideas that were completely new to her naïve sister wives.

Ragi straightened her chin, knowing what Mae was thinking, and tried to put her best face forward. Inside, her guts were gripped with fear. How could anyone break the mer-bonds, she worried. If someone tried to take Mae or Timi away from her, she would go crazy, she feared. Her heart swelled with love and affection for the larger, blonde and blueeyed mermaid who looked so very different from herself and her fellow Polynesian sister-wife. Mae's yellow and blue tail still pulsed with the echo's of their shared passion, and that made Ragi feel stronger. She turned her attention to the four mermaids in the center and tried to understand, again, what sensors were, and how they worked.

Phoebe and Petra slowly pushed themselves towards one another with their pelvic and mid-tail fins, their bodies slowly swaying in the water as they sashayed back and forth. Phoebe could feel the tug of her merbonds loosen as she sensed Pat rise up from the water into the air of the lab cave. She could still feel the strong connection to Danni and their three children, who must still be in the water of the Nursery cave. There was also the faintest, but clear connection to John, who was on the other side of the island, probably in the lagoon, she imagined based on the strength of the signal. She knew that the other mermen were with him, but she could not sense any of them. She could sense all the other mermaids in the room, however, and she catalogued all these feelings and sensations for later discussion.

She heard Sally's whistle echo down the tunnel, indicating that they could start at any time, and she turned her full attention to Petra, her former uncle. Despite the strength of her mer-bonds, she was nevertheless moved by the beauty and sensuality of the beautiful mermaid she saw floating before her. Petra was one of the tallest mermaids, nearly three meters in length. Her long brown hair flowed like rich molasses down her shoulders and along her sides. Her wide set eyes, a piercing green, sparkled above her wide and generous smile. Her strong shoulders supported the largest breasts of any of the mermaids, matched only by Galina, who had modeled her own transformation on Petra. Beautifully buoyant in the water, Petra's breasts gently swayed and bobbed in the water as she drew closer to her niece, her large, dark nipples stiff and straight in the afternoon sunlight. Her waist tapered down dramatically and then flared out to generous hips, now decorated with dark lavender scales that sparkled in the golden light.

They weren't really scales, Phoebe reminded herself; it was simply the illusion of scales created by the greatly changed texture and coloration of the skin that now covered their tails. Phoebe reached down and brushed the curving line of her own sea-blue tail as it rose along her hip bones and then dipped down under her belly only to rise up on the other hip. She marveled again at how soft their mermaid-nano-structured skin actually felt. Petra's beautiful tail, nearly two meters long, shimmered with the beginnings of luminescence, light green flickers of light that sparkled throughout her dark lavender and black tail, dancing along the edges of her dark green fins and fringes that fluttered at the ends of her flukes and down along her dorsal ridge. Phoebe felt her own bioluminescence quicken within her and knew that her own light blue tail was now shimmering with pale white light, a color that matched her own nearly white blonde hair. Mer-bonding or not, Petra was a voluptuous and beautiful creature with whom anyone might fall hopelessly in love.

For her own part, Petra had always felt more generous with her sexual affections than many of her fellow mermaids. She had never actually seduced any other mermaid—there was no need when your own pod mates were nearly always equally horny and equally available. But this was special; it was for science. And the Nordic queen that floated before her was as beautiful and desirable as either Galina or Xing, though she loved them both. Petra drank in the look of lust she saw reflected in Phoebe's shimmering, icy-blue eyes, and while not as rewarding as the love she saw in her sister-wives, it was a powerful and satisfying look nevertheless.

Wordlessly they reached out for one another, forgetting Trixi and Esmée who similarly moved together a few feet from them. Phoebe gasped as she felt Petra's stiff nipple press into her own, and then she lost herself in Petra's generous lips as they moved over her open mouth and drove her tongue in between her teeth. Petra moved her body slightly, causing the most delightful friction to erupt all along their bodies: their warm bellies pushing against each other's, their breasts sliding through and around one another's, their tails caressing the other's. Phoebe wrapped her arms around Petra and pulled against her small waist, crushing their chests together. She stuck her own tongue into Petra's mouth and dueled back and forth for sovereignty over that tender territory.

For many minutes, they kissed and nibbled at each other's mouths, rubbing their long, sinuous bodies together, clutching at one another's waist, hips, arms, shoulders, and pelvic fins. As their passion built, Phoebe was aware of John, Danni, and their three children's bond to her, the faint connections still pulsing with energy, but she lost all sense of the other mermaids around her. Petra's bioelectrical signals were overwhelming, washing over her mer-senses even as her passion built to a near crescendo. Too soon, thought Phoebe, too soon!

She pulled back from the kiss, and twisted herself away from Petra's surprised grip, but she kept her body in contact with Petra's as she started to rub herself against her former uncle. She pushed her sensitive gills against Petra's breasts, causing the latter to moan with appreciation. She twisted over Petra's shoulders, snaking her way over and around her body, keeping as much contact as possible. Phoebe pressed her own breasts into Petra's gills, and glided down over her hips and down along her dorsal ridge, trailing her own flukes over Petra's face and shoulders. She tickled the fringes along the ends of Petra's quivering flukes, sparking with luminescence, and then rose up along Petra's front with her face nuzzling and caressing the length of her tail. As Phoebe passed Petra's engorged vent, she kissed, nibbled, and licked her labia and clitoris as she passed by. She then traced a series of kisses up Petra's belly, through the enormous valley of her breasts, up along her collarbone, along her graceful neck, and back to her luscious lips. She shared the lingering taste of Petra's own juices with a deep, and passionate kiss.

Petra arched a single eyebrow and then imitated her niece. She pushed her stiff nipples into the velvety softness of Phoebe's gills, traced her dorsal ridge down to her flukes. Phoebe tried to give some of her senses over to the remaining mermaids in the Moon Pool, but she could not sense any of them, even Trixi and Esmee who were writhing together in a jumble of tails and torsos a mere meter from where she and Petra lavished their attentions on one another. Her own pod that was in the water, and Petra; that was it—no other signals came through. She gave up concentrating on science as Petra worked her way back up Phoebe's front side, stopping for many minutes at her own vent, and then sharing with Phoebe the taste of her own sex. That kiss grew in intensity, until they were both grinding themselves against one another again.

They broke their kiss, grabbed one another's pelvic fins, entwined their long tails around each other's, and pressed their vents together, mashing their swollen vaginal lips against the others'. The both moved their hips in quick, small circles, pushing their clitorises across and over the other's. Phoebe watched as Petra's enormous breasts swelled even larger, and the first drops of milk appeared along the top and sides of her stiff, thumb-like nipples.

Petra began moaning. Petra was more excited than she thought that she would be; her mer-bonds were still there, she could feel them, but making love to Phoebe was dangerous, exciting, and her body was responding. Phoebe could feel the shift in Petra's energy, and her body responded as well. Her own breasts began to leak mermaid milk as she felt that delicious tightening in her womb that signaled her impending orgasm.

"Yes, yes, yes," Phoebe moaned as she ground her hips into Petra's.

"Oh, oh, oh," Petra responded, her own breasts tingling with heaviness, swelling with milk.

Phoebe watched as Petra's breasts began to sprout streams of milk: first one, than two, than three, than five, six, ten! Petra was moaning constantly, her body building sexual tension as her orgasm approached. Phoebe quickened her pace and sharpened the circles she made with her hips, thrusting into Petra. As the water filled with Petra's milk, Phoebe felt her own orgasm hurtle towards her, but she held it back, determined to wait for Petra to go first. Both mermaids fought a losing battle with their on coming orgasms, their bodies locked together, their abdomens tight and twitching as they pushed themselves into one another. Suddenly, Petra froze, except for her still spouting breasts, which now poured milk from multiple streams from each nipple, filling the water with a white haze. Then she shuddered forward, collapsing onto Phoebe's shoulder, groaning and convulsing with each wave of pressure that rolled out from her hips across her body. Phoebe let loose the tension she had gathered into her womb, and felt her breasts match Petra's as she joined her former uncle in the wondrous throes of a female orgasm. Together, they shuddered and moaned for many minutes, until finally they were still.

After a moment, Phoebe noticed that Trixi and Esmée were staring at them with looks that could only be described as admiration, apparently having already finished a few moments before them. The other mermaids around the room share similar looks as they drifted towards the center of the pool.

"Well," Phoebe said happily. "That ought to give them something to measure."

"Mermaids?" Michael Thomson asked again, his eyes scanning the horizon before he turned around to face his two passengers lounging on the deck of his personal yacht, a Benetti Super that he had dubbed "Johanna" in honor of his deceased wife. "You're telling me that Manalo was controlled by mermaids? And you expect me to believe you?!"

"Michael," Joy said soothingly, "when have I ever lied to you?"

"There's always a first time," he said warily. "Let's just say that I believe you, just for a moment. What other capabilities do these creatures have, besides paralyzing Manalo, breathing underwater, and living for a very long time?"

"Creatures?" Mac asked, sitting forward in his chair. "You remember that you are talking about my daughter, right?"

"Relax, Mac," Joy admonished, "He didn't mean anything by that."

"No, I didn't," Michael said with a boyish grin, looking twenty years younger than his real age of sixty. "Mean anything, I mean. But I do keep forgetting that your daughter is someone who has changed. That makes your story harder to ignore."

"Tell me about it," Mac grumped as he relaxed back into his seat, looking out over the bustle of Hong Kong harbor.

"There are too many capabilities to list," Joy answered, "but to answer your first question, Shen Chin was able to keep Manalo under control with mermaid venom, which a mermaid actually provided. They can paralyze their victims, if necessary, and if they drag you underwater after you have been paralyzed, you will drown. Diluted, it can keep a person immobile but alive and alert indefinitely. There were no mermaids on that boat, although everyone you met that day has now become a mermaid."

"Except for Tuo's brother, Wong," Mac added. "He became a merman."

"Speaking of brothers, Manalo's brother visited me this morning," Michael said. "A smaller and nastier version, I'm afraid, but he doesn't worry me."

"You need not worry about Manalo, now either," Joy said. "He's now a female dolphin."

"What?" Michael protested. "These mermaids can change people into animals; Manalo is a female dolphin? I just can't believe it."

"You should come see for yourself," Joy offered. "But you should be careful, you could ... "

"What, me become a merman?" Michael scoffed.

"No, you could become a mermaid," Mac said with a grin as Joy punched him in the shoulder, scowling.

"Mac, you're not helping," Joy said with mock sternness. "You could become a mermaid or a merman if you wanted, but we've learned just today that the "Moon Pool," which is mermaid ground zero, affects any one or any thing that enters its waters. The mers' so-called "siren cell" not only changed them but also changed the bacteria and other microorganisms native to those caves. The Moon Pool is now itself a change agent; a person doesn't need to drink mermaid milk to be affected. We're just not sure how much any one can be affected."

"You've been in the Moon Pool?" Michael asked.

"Yes," Joy answered. "I've been several times, and Mac was there just a few days ago. We thought that we felt so great because we finally became lovers, but we now know that Mac and I have been getting slightly younger over the last few days, and we may have to get back to the island very soon because we've been exposed to its effects, and they aren't sure how it will affect us."

"You mean that you might start changing into mermaids?" Michael asked.

"No," Joy said, laughing at his look of surprise. "The mer-scientists theorize that we will follow a similar progression as did the original pair that landed on the island, except that we are already a heterosexual pair."

"What progression is that?" Mac asked warily.

"I thought you were paying attention," Joy teased.

"I was, but I'm asking for Michael's benefit," Mac shot back.

"The original pair were two men," Joy explained. "Over time, they both got younger and the smaller one turned female. Gills developed after a period of several months, and secondary marine characteristics, like webbed feet and hands, took several more months."

"So you have a few months?" Michael asked.

"Maybe," Joy answered. "We didn't actually drink or use any of the original goop or mermaid milk, and the mers believe that we may have weeks, months, or even years, but if we start to see gill development along our backs, we are heading back right then."

"Mermaids," Michael mused. "No kidding, straight up mermaids? What happens when they dry out?

"Nothing special," Joy said. "They can get too dry, and they start to dehydrate, but these are not magical creatures, they are biological sea mammals."

"You know something about mermaids?" Mac asked.

"No, not really," Michael said, thinking. "You can't work in the yachting industry and not learn a thing or two about why people love the water. You'd be surprised how many boat owners have some sort of thing for mermaids."

"Just boat owners?" Mac challenged. "My daughter Sally and her mate Eric had been dreaming of mermaids since they were kids, separately of course, but just the same. I bet there are a lot of people out there who might jump at the chance to become a mermaid."

"Or a merman," Michael corrected. "Yes, I know several people who I could recruit, if what you are saying is all true."

"It's all true, Michael," Joy insisted. "I swear."

"So, what do you want from me," Michael asked.

"Thanks, Michael, the list is long," Joy said with a shy smile. "But this time, it shouldn't be as dangerous as some of my other requests."

"Well, that's a relief," Michael said.

Hank Connor loved his wife. He also knew his wife, and he knew that was losing this argument. He could not, however, stop himself from continuing.

"I just want them to have some sort of normal life before they make such a big change," he repeated.

"Normal?" Janice challenged, her dark eyes flashing. "Their brother is now a mermaid who speaks four languages. The mers have several Ph.D.'s among them, and mer-learning is a hundred times more effective than Stanford could ever hope to achieve. What is so good about normal?"

Janice began to pace, her small slim body circling the kitchen table in their San Francisco home. "The best education they could receive, in terms of sheer learning, would be to become mers and take advantage of Pat's, Galina's, Alexis', and the other's educations. Besides, do you think they will become more obedient over the next three and a half years or less, especially if we transition and they do not?"

"I ... I," Hank stammered.

"How are we going to keep them in college and on track from the middle of the South Pacific, or are you giving up our own plans to return next summer?" she continued.

"Maybe they don't want to return?" Hank protested feebly.

"Yes, we do," the girls shouted as they burst into the room, revealing that they had been listening for some time.

"Dad," Kate protested. "You can't be serious! We've been wanting to go back since forever!"

"Seriously," Ann added. "Do you even pay attention? School is boring, and the last thing we want to do is go back. Besides, our roommates are stuck up bitches."

"We think was should have Christmas in the tropics," Kat said hopefully.

"You do?" Hank asked. "And who will become your podmates?"

"Rose and Trevor," they said in unison.

"Your brother?" Hank asked, incredulous.

"Our sister," Kate said with a giggle.

"But you would become lovers," Hank continued. "Not just sisters. I cannot approve of such an arrangement."

"Emma, Rikki, and Cleo have a wonderful pod," Ann protested, as she took her sister's hand in her own. "And Kate and I have been talking about this a lot, and we think it will work out just fine. Besides, who are you going to add to your pod with Mom?"

"That's none of your business," he argued.

"Of course its their business," Janice said. "No matter what happens, we will still be a family. Nothing will ever change that. Rose is still our child, even if she isn't our son any longer. Girls are less hung up about these sorts of things than guys are; too bad you're not more like us."

"That's not fair," Hank said, a blush rising from his neck. "I know how close you are with Julie, but Brian is about as likely to agree to become a mermaid as I am!"

"Aunt Julie and Uncle Brian are coming with us?" Kate asked.

"You're not going anywhere," Hank said, his anger rising.

"Yes, they are," Janice said evenly, her face calm. "Now, I know that you're upset that I told my sister about the mers, but that has nothing to do with your objections to their coming with us. We can work out something with Julie and Brian, I'm sure. Besides, we will never know if Brian is willing to become a mermaid unless we ask him."

"When did you plan on doing that?" Hank asked, calming himself as he felt his wife's strength of spirit wash over the room.

"As soon as you decide when we are going back," Janice said, sitting at the kitchen table.

"Well, it won't be anytime soon," Hank said. "It can't be until after the end of the school year, which is why they should go back to college."

"We could go tomorrow or we could go next year," Janice said. "But the longer we wait, the less likely Rose and Trevor will be able to wait for Kate and Ann. I know that the girls have their heart set on Trevor, and I think it would be selfish of us to let our own troubles with deciding on our pod deprive them of their happiness. It's not like we are considering NOT going back to the island; Trevor and Rose want to wait, but what if they have to rescue someone, like Eric and Sally did with Alexis and Liga. What do you think will happen? Will they wait for Kate and Ann to return, or rescue the person in need?"

"Trevor is an honorable man," Hank said with a defeated sigh. "He would do the right thing to help out someone in need." He turned to his two daughters and looked at them sternly. "Do you girls really want to be with Rose and Trevor? This is not a decision that you can do over; once we go, that's how it will be for the next six or seven hundred years."

"Oh, Daddy," Kate said. "That's practically the dumbest question ever."

"Is there anyone else you'd like to see us with?" challenged Ann. "Did you have someone else in mind?"

"No, nothing like that," Hank reassured them, his heart nearly breaking as he saw the deep wells of emotion in each of their eyes. His little girls were grown up, though just barely, and although he knew that they had long held a crush on Trevor, he always imagined that only one of his girls would become Trevor's wife.

"Honey," Janice said soothingly. "There is a certain justice in this."

"What do you mean?" Hank asked.

"We don't have to watch Trevor be forced to choose which of our two girls he really loves," she said smiling at her daughters. "He can have all three, and there will be no one left behind."

"Never thought of it that way," he said feebly.

"So, there's nothing preventing us from leaving tomorrow," Janice said brightly. "Besides, the environmental work that we could be doing won't get any easier the longer we wait."

"But we can't just ... " Hank protested.

"Oh, but we can," Janice interrupted. "All it will take is one signature, and the foundation you set up will go into effect. We could leave anytime."

"Oh, please, Daddy, PLUUUUEEEEAAAASEEEEE," both girls squealed.

"I want to go through those papers a few more times," Hank protested. "I don't want to be caught with my pants down a few years from now."

"Oh, Daddy," Kate giggled. "You won't be able to wear pants a few years from now."

Sudhish Basra breathed deeply, calming himself before he knocked on the door. Malaki Dimaunahan, his boss, had killed seven people in the last two days: three in the very office into which he was about to walk with what Sudhish assumed would be bad news. He thought again, for perhaps the hundredth time that day, what his older sister, Geeta, was already suffering at the hands of Malaki's organization, and what his younger sisters might suffer if he lost his temper or slipped-up in any way. He could condemn them to a life of prostitution or worse, and he felt the bile and shame rise in his throat again as he knocked on the rich, mahogany door.

"Come in," was the oddly dispassionate invitation from the other side of the door.

Sudhish strode into the room confidently and placed the printed email on Malaki's desk. The older man turned from the windows that offered a magnificent view of the surrounding city from the 78th floor of the Petronas Towers, and picked up the email. He scanned it quickly.

"Send for Torro," Malaki ordered without looking up from the email. "I will kill Alberto Estanado with my own bare hands if I have to," he continued in a soft voice. "I will find him and kill him if it costs me every son I have fathered. Did Abao send any other communication?"

"No, sir," Sudhish answered. "That email was the only word. No phone calls, no satellite link, nothing."

"What do you make of this?" Malaki asked, waving the email in front of his secretary.

"Me, sir?"

"Yes, you."

"Well, I think Abao thinks he can impress you by finding Manalo and his kidnappers, killing Alberto, and returning with your money," Sudhish answered.

"Do you think he will succeed?"

"No, sir."

"Why not?"

"Well, sir," Sudhish said, shifting his weight between his two feet. "Tumibay went in with an experienced team, with plenty of firepower, and the element of surprise. His yacht was destroyed and all his men have disappeared. That's impressive, even for Mr. Estanado. Manalo followed, your own son, and Alberto was able to convince him to either join with him, made him an accomplice, or threatened him into cooperating, although I cannot imagine what Alberto could possibly hold over your son."

"Perhaps it was Miss Chin that held something?" Malaki asked. "Miss Chin, her sister, and several girls from the Davao brothel disappeared, they strangely show up in Hong Kong, and now all of them, including my son, are missing. How can Mr. Estanado be responsible for all this?"

"I do not know," Sudhish answered. "I only know that three separate attempts have been made on Alberto's hideaway, and none have yet succeeded. Abao is going in with only a few men, his personal bodyguards, none of whom are experienced in maritime operations or combat. They are simply thugs. Whether they meet Alberto's gang or Miss Chin, I do not think it will matter. There are too many unanswered questions, and Abao has made a foolish mistake. He has not even told us which one of the hundreds of tiny islands that he will be attacking, in case he gets into trouble."

"On that final point, I agree with you," Malaki sighed. "My second son is a fool. You may go."

"Yes, sir," Sudhish answered as he turned to leave.

"One more thing," Malaki said in the same casual tone that marked nearly everything he uttered.

"Yes, sir?" Sudhish asked, turning again.

"If you persist in trying to locate your sister, I will kill her," he said lightly. "Then, I will take your other sisters. Do you understand?"

"Yes, sir," Sudhish answered, his face burning with anger and shame.

Rose and Trevor had spent several days exploring the surrounding area to the south of their island. They found countless shipwrecks, airplanes, and strange formations of rock and choral. Now they were exploring a large, luxury yacht that must have sunk in a recent storm, as there was no damage to the hull or deck and there was only a dusting of barnacles on the various parts of the boat. No sign of the passengers could be found, despite a wide sweep of the area.

In one of the staterooms Rose found a set of paintbrushes and a large collection of oil paints. None of the sketchpads were usable--the paper disintegrated as she touched it--but the brushes and tubes of paint were still intact. She could hear Trevor going through one of the other rooms, muttering to himself. She decided to try to paint something on the wall of the room, even though she knew that the oil would probably not cure underwater. But it had been so long since she exercised her artist self that she was determined to at least try.

As she wondered if she should just collect the paint in her net/bag and wait until they were back in the caves to paint more or less normally, she reviewed her own education as an artist. She smiled to herself as she pictured her old self, Robbie, talking to her new self, Rose. How much had changed since his college days, and although he had never dreamed of becoming a girl, being a mermaid was better than she thought possible. She felt her heart ache as she thought of her sisters, whom she knew to be desperately wishing to be with her and Trevor. At least she wouldn't have to worry about her sisters fighting over Trevor's attention; all of them could share equally once they became mers. She shook herself from her reverie, and thought again about the paint that lay before her in the dim light of the stateroom. How would she ever get paint to dry underwater?

Wait, she thought to herself, an oil based painting underwater was theoretically possible because oil paint didn't dry via evaporation, it oxidized, a chemical reaction equivalent to combustion. She nodded to herself, remembering her "art foundations class." The oxidized oil set off other chemical reactions that caused the oil to polymerize--to form long chain-like molecules that cross-link to one another, stabilizing the film of paint. Over time, those polymer bonds ionize, which creates a permanent bond between both the paints and the surface to which it has been applied. Since there was oxygen in water, it was possible that she could get the paint to oxidize.

Alright, she thought to herself, now she was getting somewhere. Pat had said something about their mer organs and ionization, but she couldn't remember what. Well, "he" had never been very good at science, but he had been very good at art. Perhaps "she" could be a scientist and an artist. Perhaps "she" could get the paint to stick to the wall of the stateroom after all. She would need to free up the oxygen in the water so that it could bond with the oil paint. She looked at the metal brush in her hand and remembered that underwater plasma techniques in metal cutting used high intensity electrical discharges to convert water into steam, which also frees up hydroxyl and hydrogen radicals. She didn't want to cut metal, and didn't think the mers' electrical organs could generate that much power anyway. She only wanted a tiny reaction, microscopic, and only at the end of her paint brush.

That was it! She could use the wrong end of the brush as the focal point for very quick and very small pulses of electricity that would cause the paint to oxidize as she pressed it into the wall of the cabin. The mers had refrained from trying to use their mer-organs in this way for fear of releasing too much energy, but Rose pushed those worries aside. She wanted to paint, and come hell or high water, she was going to paint. She only wanted to generate the smallest of reactions ... OMG, she practically said out loud to herself, the micro-bubbles they saw during mer-transition in the Moon Pool were exactly the tiny reactions she wanted. That level of energy production must be natural to the mers, maybe they were incapable of a really big shock, despite what Pat and the others had said.

She squeezed out a tiny bit of red paint and tried to get it to flow onto the tip of the handle, but the paint was less dense than the heavy, salty water around it and slowly rose up away from the brush. She dropped the metal tube and cupped the globule of paint in her hand, stopping its rise, and then brought the the slender point and poked it into the center of the blob of paint. It stuck to the top of the handle, and she carefully moved her hand away.

She focused her mind on creating an ionizing force from her mer organs that flowed up her dorsal ridge, through her arm, and out to the tip of the paintbrushes' pointed end as she moved the long, thin, metal handle towards the wall of the stateroom and began to trace her first work of art as a mermaid. She noticed a growing pressure rising from her tail, but it wasn't painful, and so she ignored it as she worked. She noticed that a trail of microscopic bubbles, barely visible to the naked eye (even to a mermaid's enhanced naked eye), rose from the end of her brush as she pushed the paint onto the wall. It seemed to be working! She didn't know how she was doing it, but she didn't care. She was creating incredibly tiny pulses of energy that exploded from the end of her paintbrush, and vaporized a tiny group of water molecules. Satisfied that she could actually paint, she added some of her mental focus back into being an artist. Soon, a quick sketch of Trevor's tail began to take shape on the wall. She opened a tube of black paint and added that second color to her sketch, working quickly, forcing the paint onto the wall with the hard tip of the paintbrush's handle. She could feel herself go "into the zone" that characterized her work as an artist when she was still a human (and a boy). Her mind felt amazingly alive as she effortlessly pushed paint onto the wall in bold strokes, every cell of her being focused on her task.

Trevor heard tapping and scrapping coming from another part of the wreck, and he warily moved through the boat towards the sound. Was Rose making these noises or was she in a different area of the wreck? As he got closer, he noticed that something seemed to be off with Rose's bioelectrical signal. It was behaving in a way he had never noticed or felt. He pushed himself more quickly down the narrow hallway of the sunken boat and passed through the open door where he sensed Rose was and was struck by a strange sight. Rose was painting. She worked quickly, taking paint from a series of small tubes and pushing them onto the wall with the wrong end of a paintbrush. Small air bubbles wobbled along the ceiling of the stateroom, seeking a way out towards the surface. The small room was perceptively warmer, but only a tiny bit. Whatever Rose was doing, she was generating heat. He started to say something, but he could tell that she was "in the zone," and so he just watched her work. He noticed that her beautiful red tail was pulsing with light, but they were neither the same lights that signified sex nor the lights that signified their mer-organs defense against pressure. The patterns rose from her scarlet flukes to the tip of her black, velvety-fringed, dorsal ridge, which was barely visible behind her floating, black hair.

Rose had no sense of time as she worked, she didn't realize that she was actually warming up the room, and she didn't even sense that Trevor had joined her. After nearly an hour of work, the painting was done. Trevor's dramatic red and black striped tail curled up behind him, his gold fringed flukes spread out behind his head, dramatically offsetting his long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. His arms were crossed on his chest, and his slim hips and firm abdomen glistened in the oil paints on the wall. She floated for a moment, looking at the portrait of her lover that she had just created. Then she added her initials to his left hip and closed her eyes, leaving the tip in the freshly applied paint, focusing on her hope that it would stick to the wall. Her tail pulsed strongly, and a fine web of tiny filaments of light played across the painting, flickering and pulsing across the surface of the work. After a minute or two, the she felt the slight pressure in her tail subside, and she lifted her brush to look at her finished work.

"It's amazing," Trevor said, startling her.

"Holy Shit!" she shouted. "You scared me."

"Sorry," Trevor said as he pushed himself into the room. "I didn't want to disturb the artist at work."

"Oh," Rose said, regaining her composure.

"It's really good," Trevor said drifting towards the painting.

"Don't touch it," Rose cautioned. "It takes weeks for the oil to solidify in the air, and I'm not certain it will ever firm up here."

"It looks dry to me," Trevor said, backing his hand away from the wall.

"Can't be," Rose said, moving closer to the wall.

"Why not?" Trevor said.

"Oil doesn't dry, it oxidizes," she said, reaching out with one finger to touch the paint on the wall. She gasped. The paint was solid. "Or ionizes."

"Huh?" asked Trevor, confused.

"Never mind," Rose said, excitedly. "We have to get back to the island right away!"

"What about the painting?" Trevor asked.

"It's not going anywhere," Rose said, grabbing his hand and pulling him out through the door. "We can come back for it later."

"What's so important?" complained Trevor.

"Mermaids can polymerize," Rose said, grinning.

"Huh?"

Two men looked over the thousands of cargo containers stacked on the deck of the Marfret Provance, a large container ship. They stood on the top of a tall stack of containers that loomed high above the churning sea below. Each man was linked to a safety wire that ran the length of the ship, but if the wind caught them now, they would be dragged in the water for several minutes before their crewmates would be able to reel them back aboard, so the both moved slowly over the rolling boxes.

"The Captain is crazy," the shorter one complained as the wind lashed at them. "We are going to get killed on this damn box boat."

"We are getting five thousand extra to dump these two over the side and to keep our mouths shut," the taller one shouted back. "Get your cable ready and wait for the signal."

The two men crawled towards the ends of the large green container that lay atop the aft-most stack of containers on the port side. The containers were covered with Chinese characters indicating that they came from Hong Kong, and had the blessings of the Ministry of Science. The two men, however, could not read Chinese. They each looked down at the cables and twist locks that secured one box to the next, and so on, each one linked to the others and then to the ship itself. They clambered down the sides of the stack while the wind and spray lashed at them, snapping their safety lines as they snaked down the side of the stack. When they reached the second container down from the top, each man unlinked the cables and clamps that held the top two boxes to the rest of stack. Then they scrambled back up to the top of the stack, moving to the top of the box adjacent to the ones they had just unlimbered as quickly as they could. Then they each picked up a long pry bar and inserted it into the space between the outside box and the interior one upon which they stood. They looked out at the grey sea for a moment, watching the wind and rain saw across the horizon, the dark sea below them churning, and then each waved one arm in the direction of the bridge.

The ship began to slowly turn, pushing the bow of the ship away from the headwind into which it had been headed. As the bow plunged down between the wave troughs rather than through them, the ship began to rock from side to side, gaining momentum with each set of waves that swelled beneath the ship. The two men rocked with the majestic swings of the giant ship, the agonizingly slow cycle of the waves as the ship rolled back and forth along its keel. They watched each other, nodding their heads as they counted the seconds between each cycle. As the ship rolled towards port a final time, they both nodded and pulled back on the levers with all their strength. The two top containers quietly and quickly rolled off the ship and plunged into the sea below.

"Why are we dumping these boxes in the middle of no where?" the complaining crewmember shouted as he worked his way back towards his crewmate, while the ship began its slow torturous turn back into the wind.

"Five thousand extra," his taller crewmate answered as they watched the containers recede into the distance, bobbing heavily along the surface of the waves.

"I wonder what is inside those boxes?" Shorty asked, as he peered over the side of the ship, ignoring his partner's actions.

"For five thousand, we don't ask any questions," the other said as he turned towards his partner's safety line and cut it.

"I am just curious," Shorty argued, turning to face his partner, his back to the sea. "What's wrong with knowing what we just dumped into the ocean?"

"Perhaps you will get to find out," the tall one said as he gently pushed one hand into the complaining crewmember's chest, causing him to fall off the boat and into the sea. He watched for a moment as the shorter man struggled in the sea, and when he could not see the man's head bobbing in the waves, he said "Good for nothing college drop out."

The tall man began working his way back to the bridge, leaning into the increasing headwind as the ship continued to turn back into the wind, putting even more distance between the boat and the boxes and castaway still bobbing in the dark sea. "Thinks he's better than everyone else, eh?" the tall man muttered into the wind, smiling. "Now, it's ten thousand for me, and someone for the captain to blame for the missing boxes."

Hank Connor held his pen poised above the stack of papers for a moment, his face grave and still. His wife of 29 years beside him, and across the table sat one of his oldest and most trusted friends, Bartholomew Kolbert, his former college roommate and now, a partner at the prestigious law firm of Pillsbury, Winthrop, Shaw, and Pittman. Outside the large plate glass window, a San Francisco street car clanged and rattled as it went by and the street below, breaking the silence.

"Hank?" Janice prompted.

"One signature, eh?" he said ironically, looking at the tall stack of papers that awaited his signature.

"I didn't say how many times you had to sign, only that it was your signature alone that was necessary," she countered with a gentle smile.

He shot his wife a quick smile in return, sighed, and signed his name at the bottom of the sheet of paper.

"Now this one, next," his long-time lawyer and family friend, Bartholomew (call me Bart) Kolbert said as he pushed the next stack towards his old friend.

"How many of these are there?" Hank asked testily, as he affixed his name to another set of documents.

"You wrote half of them yourself," Bart said. "This work is all airtight, really good, especially for someone who isn't a lawyer."

"Starting up your own dot com teaches you a lot about the law," Hank said as he watched Bart's secretary notarize his signatures.

"So, the girls aren't returning to college?" Bart asked. "You all are going to go off to this island you bought and start to build some sort of research facility?"

"They are both interested in marine biology," Janice answered quickly. "Since this new Marine Mammal Institute will eventually attract scholars and scientists from all over the world, we believe that both Kate and Ann will have more of a "hands-on" education in the sciences."

"Better than Stanford or UCLA?" Bart asked, as he pushed another stack towards Hank.

"We already have scientists on staff who graduated from MIT, Evergreen State University, St. Petersburg State Marine Technical University, and the Russian Academy of Sciences," explained Hank as he continued to sign document after document, handing them to the notary.

"You have staff already?" asked Bart. "You barely have title to the island."

"I thought we had title to five islands," Hank said with annoyance.

"You do," Bart reassured him. "I just thought you might spend more time before you put anyone on staff. We don't even have all the visas cleared for the financial transactions we've already undertaken. I have no idea how we will pay anyone, let alone staff you've already hired."

"Oh, don't worry," Hank said with a mysterious smile. "These people have been working on the island for several years. The MMI will only facilitate and expand work that has already been started."

"Ah, I see," Bart said as he pushed yet another stack at Hank. "Someday you are going to have to explain Appendix T to me. It doesn't have anything to do with something vaguely illegal that you want Greenpeace to pursue, does it?"

"No," Hank said laughing. "Nothing with Greenpeace, I assure you."

"Seriously?" Janice giggled. "Appendix T?"

"It's a private joke, Bart," Hank started, turning away from his wife as he was handed yet another stack of papers to sign. "You will receive a message from me to unseal one of my personal safety deposit boxes, and there will be more instructions there. The code words in Appendix T will make more sense then. Greenpeace is not going to be part of the MMI, at least not initially. That's the best I can do for now, but trust me, the mere fact that you are the only name on that document is a testament to how much I trust you. I cannot yet tell you more. "

"Well, you can remain mysterious a while longer," Bart said, pushing yet another stack of papers in front of Hank. "I had always thought you'd retire to an island somewhere, but I thought it would be later rather than sooner."

"You'll understand some day," Hank assured him as he signed yet another stack of documents. "I promise; you can come for a visit, and then you'll understand everything."

"I don't want to come for a visit," Bart protested. "I just want to know where you are. You know how much I hate the water."

"Yes, Bart," Janice said, resting her hand on his arm. "We know, and that's why we know that you are the only one that we can truly trust to remain behind, run our financial accounts, and not let anyone try to steal the trusts or foundations from us."

"Besides, once we get all the equipment set up and running, we can visit via satellite hook up," Hank said laughing. "You'll never need to even get your feet wet."

"How much more vacation time do you have left?" Joy asked as she turned under her blanket to face Mac in the first class sleeper pod they shared on the Airbus A380.

"Let's see now," Mac said, ticking off the days on his fingers. "Three days to get to Mermaid Island, four days there, then two days up to Hong Kong, a week there, and now one day flying to Kuala Lampur. I have two more weeks of vacation, six weeks of unused sick leave, and two weeks of unused personal leave. Why?"

"So to be safe, you should resign your commission in another four weeks," Joy said thoughtfully. "Which means we only have a few days here before we head off to Washington, D.C."

"Why the rush?" Mac asked.

"We're changing quickly enough so that Michael's secretary asked you if you had dyed your hair," Joy said. "Your hair darkened enough in eight days that a stranger noticed."

"I'm on vacation," Mac protested. "Who will notice someone's hair changing color? Hell, people's hair changes color on vacation all the time."

"Yes," Joy agreed. "It gets lighter, by the sun, not darker because you're getting younger. At this rate of change, we will be unrecognizable as ourselves in a few months. Because it's still hard to judge, we need to accomplish what we can as quickly as possible. We don't want to expose the secret of the mers sooner than we have planned."

"As usual, you're right," Mac agreed, sighing.

"What's wrong?" Joy asked.

"Two things," Mac said, as he stretched out his legs. "One, I wanted a shot at Joint Chief's of Staff before I retired, and two, when we get back to Mermaid Island, Mark will technically have seniority on me as far as mer-time goes."

"Well, we'll just have to make sure that we recruit two other senior officers for our pod," Joy teased. "That way our pod will out-rank his."

"Speaking of out rank, do you think Dr. Su and Michael will be able to get those supplies sent to the island?" Hank asked.

"Taiping is one of my oldest contacts and a dear friend," Joy said. "Besides, after he gave the Ministry of Science that anemone that eats pollution, he will get anything he asks for with no questions asked. Michael has been getting things done for me for years, things that only a rich and well connected man can do for a lady like me."

"A lady like you is expensive," Mac said teasingly.

"But I'm worth it," Joy said as she leaned across their small, private bed, and kissed him soundly.

"How will Taiping keep the location and the purpose secret?" Mac asked.

Joy shot him a look of complete shock.

"What? I'm curious if the Chinese do it differently than we do," he protested.

"As long as we keep sending him scientific breakthroughs, we will be fine," Joy said. "He is very well placed, and his superiors know better, and leave him alone. Taiping will be fine, barring a radical shake-up among the higher ups. Besides, Pat and the others are working on the ultimate defense, and once Taiping explains why it would be in China's best interest to keep his secret contact a secret, we will not have to worry about China at least."

"Yes," Mac sighed. "We will only have the United States, Russia, India, the European Union, and any crackpot nation to worry about."

"We will take care of the US and Europe," Joy said confidently. "India will follow western policy, Galina is pretty sure Russia will follow the US, and that leaves only crackpot nations. Hopefully, you'll have trained up the mer-navy enough so we won't have to worry about them so much."

"I still get to be an admiral, eh?" Mac joked. "Have you thought of who we should recruit to be in our pod?"

"I've got a few ideas," Joy said with a mysterious smile.

"I'll bet you do," Mac grumped, knowing that look. "Well, there is no one that I either need enough or trust enough to recruit to be a member of my pod. I'll grant that you got lucky with Mark. He was a great choice."

"Yes, he was," Joy agreed. "I have some feelers out, but I'll make sure that you get the final say. After all, the four of us will have to live together for a very long time."

"Yes, we will," Mac agreed, kissing her.

"What if one of them is a man?" Joy asked.

"There is only going to be one merman in my pod," Mac said gruffly. "Me."

"But how would you feel making him into a mermaid?" Joy asked as she leaned into him and kissed his ear.

"I don't know," Mac said. "I never thought about it."

"Well, think about it," Joy urged as she nuzzled his ear.

"I think I will feel the same way you feel," Mac said, lifting his head to allow her greater access to his neck.

"And how do you think I feel about that?" Joy asked, nibbling at his ear lobe.

"I think it turns you on," Mac said, reaching around her shoulders and drawing her into his chest.

"You think that helping you turn an old friend into a mermaid turns me on?" Joy breathed into his neck as her other hand reached for Mac's crotch.

"It turns me on," Mac gasped as Joy tugged at his now hard cock.

"How would you do it?" she asked as she began to stroke him through his pants.

"Do what?" Mac asked as he fumbled under her skirt, seeking her crotch with his urgent fingers.

"Force someone to become a mermaid," Joy said, gasping as Mac's fingers found her swollen and wet bud. She pushed her own hand down Mac's pants and started to pull on his stiff cock.

"I don't think I would force someone," Mac said. "It doesn't seem right."

"Of course," Joy agreed. "But we're just playing right now, this is just fantasy. Tell me ... how?"

"Oh, just fantasy eh?" Mac smiled, warming to his task as Joy worked on his cock. "First, he would willingly feed from your breasts, sucking the life changing milk from your own body," Mac said as Joy's body began to stiffen as his fingers twirled around her clitoris. "He would believe that he would be the merman, but then you would jerk my cock, just like you're doing now, right into his face."

"What if he fought us?" Joy asked, her hips beginning to twitch.

"We would time him up, or the other girl would help us hold him, hold his mouth open," Mac moaned. "And I would ... would ... ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" he muttered as he erupted into Joy's hand.

"Yesssssssssss," Joy agreed as her own orgasm swept through her body.

Danni looked down into the sparkling blue eyes of her daughter as Freya tugged at her breast, feeding. Freya's golden blonde hair already cascaded over her shoulders even though she was only a little over three weeks old. She looks like a perfect China Doll, Danni thought, with her smooth pale skin, big blue eyes, curly blonde hair, and ... well ... a perfect Mermaid China Doll, with her pale blue tail fringed with golden highlights along her fins and flukes that matched her blond hair. The golden fringe along the trailing edge of her flukes tickled Danni's lap as she held her daughter in the soft glow of the afternoon sun as it filtered through the chimney of the Moon Pool.

"Oh, Freya," Danni cooed, "You are so beautiful, a perfect little mermaid. I love you so much."

Freya's eyes widened with emotion, almost as if she understood her mother, and then she doubled her efforts to pull the life-sustaining milk from her mother's large, heavy breasts. Her tiny fists pushed at the sides and underside of Danni's breast as her small mouth engulfed the large nipple that dripped with milk.

"Do you think they can understand us?" Danni asked her sister wives, who sat on either side of her, also feeding their daughters.

"What does your CHEW tell you?" Pat asked.

Danni closed her eyes and focused on the special connection that all mers could feel amongst one another. The one that connected her to her daughter pulsed stronger than the ones that wove her pod together, and Freya's CHEW pulsed with love, hunger, and happiness.

"She knows that I love her," Danni said. "And she's still hungry. Her CHEW is pulsing with happiness."

"Um, wait a minute here," John interrupted, pausing in his task of moving a tub of smoked fish within reach of the feeding mothers. "What the heck is a chew?"

"Oh, sorry love," Pat said with a grin. "While you boys were out trying to figure out how to fight off the bad guys, the girls made a major scientific discovery."

"Really, I thought you all just had a major orgy," John teased.

"You're just jealous because you weren't there," Phoebe teased back, shifting Cynthia to her other breast as her daughter fed ravenously.

"You never know when insight will strike," Pat rejoined. "Newton had to wait for the apple to bonk him on the head before he understood something that was right under his nose."

"So, you had an orgy, and got bonked on the head. What is a chew?" John repeated, salamandering behind his wives, curling his flukes around Phoebe, rubbing his mid-tail fins against Danni's back, and draping his arm around Pat's shoulders so that he could stroke Maureen's head as she feed from her mother.

"Well, it took us a couple of days after the orgy to figure it out," Pat admitted. "But we think we have it nailed."

"What is nailed?" asked John.

"C.H.E.W.," Pat explained, "stands for Christoffel, Higgs, Einstein Wave."

"O.K.," John said slowly. "Einstein I got ... the rest is gibberish."

"Elwin Bruno Christoffel was a German mathematician and Physicist," Phoebe explained. "He discovered the Levi-Civita connection in ..."

"Um, can we just cut to the chase?" John asked.

"She's just been studying," Pat said smiling at her sister-wife. "She's worked very hard on all the books that Joy sent us."

"Mark and Wong's pods are back already?" John asked.

"No, not the drop that happened yesterday," Phoebe said. "The one from last month. Jeesh, even I can't read that fast."

"Oh, right. CHEW?" John repeated.

"Chrsitoffel theorized parallel transports of packets within curved space," Phoebe explained. "Peter Higgs discovered a new particle associated with superconductivity and String Theory, and Einstein was the inspiration for Pat and Alexis when they first identified a plausible theory for our mer-connections."

"And it added a vowel so we could remember our acronym," Danni teased.

"It's difficult to explain," Pat advised. "But in a nutshell, we noticed that our mer-connections were some how intensified or amplified when we were all in the Nursery Cave last week. While we were all still in the throes of sex, we tried to "see" the connections the way that Eric says he can."

"We weren't successful," Phoebe said, "but we had a lot of fun trying."

"I'll be you did," John said smiling.

"It didn't matter where we were relative to one another; we were always able to feel or see the connections we had with our mates as long as we were all in the water," Pat continued. "Even when we tried to deliberately scramble the signals, we could always tell where our podmates were and what their state of being was. We could sense everyone else if they were nearby, except during sex when the intensity of our disrupted CHEW overwhelmed everything else, but our own pods were still clear, special, despite any attempt to scramble the connection."

"How did you try to scramble the signals?" John teased. "Did you finally have your fling with your ex-uncle?" he asked Phoebe.

"Yes," she answered, sticking her tongue at him. "After we moved back to the Moon Pool for testing. Too bad for you that you couldn't watch."

"I've got everything I'll ever want, right here," John answered, stroking her pelvic fin with his flukes.

"Anyway, like Phoebe said, we decided to get serious about why our signals were stronger in the water than in the air and with our own pods and not other mers," Pat continued. "So we moved back into the Moon Pool, and we were able to record everyone's signals in the sensors we placed all around the pool. Everyone's signals were equal, according to the sensors, even when pod-mates were having sex."

"And we always feel more strongly connected during sex," John nodded, following along. "So, either the sensors weren't picking up the full signal or we are just imagining the varying strengths of our signals."

"Right," Pat agreed, proud of how well John kept up with her explanations of science. "Alexis remembered that superconductive materials are often more dense than other materials that also conduct electromagnetic waves and that super-conducted waves are themselves subject to less distortion and signal loss."

"Water is not superconductive, is it?" asked John.

"No," said Phoebe. "We are, but only in water."

"We believe that our new mer-organs shape a small part of our own electromagnetic fields into a highly condensed, superconductive waveform that is as idiosyncratic as our DNA," Pat explained. "When we emotionally and physically bind ourselves together during sex, we become attuned to one-another's individual waveforms, allowing us to 'see' the superconductive wave that was there all the time. But, once a signal has been "attuned," then it finds us, like a magnet, rather than us being a radio receiver."

"What do you mean, finds us?" John asked.

"When the sun sends out light energy, it goes everywhere," Pat explained. "The light doesn't find your eyes; your eyes gather in the light and then your brain translates those signals into information from which it then constructs a picture of the world. If you were attuned to the sun's light, you could be deep in a cave, and a tendril of light would still find you. The twists and turns of the cave would not prevent the suns rays from finding you."

"Wow, that's freaky," John mused.

"Sort of," Pat agreed. "But it explains what we experience in terms of how we know ourselves to be connected to one another. All living things generate some level of electromagnetic activity. Most organisms only generate very tiny signals, and only a few species can sense, or see, those signals, like sharks. We can sense all bio-electromagnetic activities, but we sense our own pods in a way that is fundamentally different from all others. Something has to account for that difference."

"CHEW," John repeated.

"When we looked over the parts of Agba and Angara that we have preserved, we could see that the receptors in our mer-organs have a very unusual shape to them, sort of like a blanket that has been folded over on itself again and again. This shape, according to Galina, is very similar to some of the most recent models for our "superstring universe." We didn't see the importance of that observation until later, but those receptors then send signals to our brain, not unlike the signals that our brain receives from our eyes or our ears, and our brains turn that signal into information. Electromagnetic information, rather than sound or light. And, just like a light picture that can be burned into your memory from your eyes, something so vivid you'll never forget it, the electromagnetic waveforms that each of us generate becomes literally burned into our brains."

"Why is it that only Eric can see these waveforms?" John asked.

"He doesn't see the waveform itself any better than you do," Pat said. "When you look at a sunset, you see the same colors, the same ocean, the same sky: you both see the waveform, the picture. But Eric can see some of the light rays too, without the benefit of the clouds forcing some light shafts to appear brighter than others. He doesn't see all the light rays; he only sees the strong, superconductive signals, the ones we generate. Other animals only look like lights, just like when you look the sun. We think that his receptors must be larger or somehow different from the rest of ours, and when we get the equipment Joy is sending us, we will try to find out."

"I think I understand," John said. "So, I can 'see' each of you, the totality of your signal, your waveform. But I can't see the actual condensed, superconductive wave that snakes through the air and joins us together. Only Eric can."

"Right," answered Phoebe. "But we're not sure the waveform actually travels through the air, or water, or even our normal three or four dimensional space. The parts of our receptors seem to be mimicking the mathematical models for superstring "multiverse." That's why the "Higgs" is in the acronym CHEW; the Higgs Field is what superstrings travel through, and that's what we think Eric is actually seeing."

"Um, this is where I freak out, right?" John asked.

"No," Pat said reassuringly. "Phoebe is exaggerating a bit. Do you remember the particle colliders they are building all over the place?"

"One in Huston and one in Geneva?" asked John.

"Actually, there are hundreds of colliders all over the world," Pat said. "But the one in Geneva is the largest and is, or at least was, not yet finished when we landed on Mermaid Island. There, they will smash all kinds of particles together to break them down into smaller particles to discover the nature of the universe."

"Now who is exaggerating?" teased John.

"Seriously," Pat said, switching her daughter to her other breast. "They are testing what scientists call "The Standard Model," a theory that attempts to explain all physical phenomena in the Universe. Anyway, my point is that even those machines do not 'see' these particles pass through the Higgs Field, they only see the traces of those particles, like skid marks on a road."

"So, Eric can see the echo's of our signals?" John asked.

"Yea," Pat agreed. "That's close enough."

John digested this information for a bit as he watched his daughters feeding. He was reminded, again, of how lucky he was to have three such different and vibrant mermaids for his mates. Pat was steady and thoughtful, with her strong, silent leadership, so much against the stereotype of the fiery redhead she resembled. Danni was the consummate mother, always giving and loving her pod-mates and all three of their children, again, so much against the stereotype of the statuesque, blonde, sex-goddess that she resembled. Finally, Phoebe was the mischievous and brilliant, imaginative child, very much against her strangely odd, but compellingly beautiful, icy Nordic, white upon white complexion and coloring. Each of them were looking into the eyes of their daughters, each so beautiful but so different.

"So, how does CHEW explain the emotional changes?" John asked. "All this talk is pretty technical, and it doesn't seem to explain my feelings for all of you. No one who has been changed can remember feeling the same levels of ... well, emotional connectedness."

"You mean love?" Pat asked, turning to kiss her lover.

"Yes, love, then," John agreed, sheepishly. "Why do we feel so in love, rather than just plain old connected, like an electrical circuit?"

"Have you ever held onto a live wire for very long," Pat teased.

"Why should I when I've got you three to keep me on my toes?" he shot back.

"Ha. Don't make the comparison until you've tried it," Phoebe said.

"Are we making another bet?" John asked.

"What, that we're more powerful than a live electrical wire?" asked Phoebe.

"No, that I'm more powerful than that wire, my girl!" John said with a laugh.

"Oh, I'd like that bet," Danni said.

"No, you wouldn't," Phoebe said. "John is better than a mere electrical connection, but we still haven't discovered if our mer organs can actually shock anyone. What if he accidentally killed you, or you accidentally killed him? We are packing a lot of electrical energy in here," she finished, slapping her tail with her free hand, causing Cynthia to pull away from her nipple. "I'm sorry, honey. I was just teasing your dad."

"I'm not as up on this as I should be," Pat said slowly, "but lots of cognitive scientists have been using MRI's to track changes to the brain caused by love."

"Seriously?" John asked. "They study love?"

"Yes, smarty pants," Pat said. "They study how the brain changes in response to love. All animals form attachments of various kinds and types, and when they do, their brains and body chemistry changes. When humans fall in love, their brains are saturated with hormones and chemicals that cause them to behave differently, focus solely upon the object of their love, take risks, and all sorts of things. The brain basically burns pathways into the structure of your memory that cause you to feel love."

"So, love is just a chemical reaction?" John said wistfully. "I thought it was something more."

"Is sunlight on your face any less enjoyable because you understand what a photon is?" challenged Pat.

"Well, it could be more enjoyable if I thought Ra was sending his love to me," said John.

"Or it could cause you great fear because you thought that the Sun God was going to die unless you kept a log burning all night during the winter solstice," Pat said. "Just because we understand how something happens doesn't make it less special. Sometimes, it makes it more special. We mers are miracles, a one in a billion shot chance, and as we discover more about ourselves and our capabilities, it won't make me one iota less happy that I am a mermaid, your mermaid."

"But we bond differently," John continued. "We mermen cannot be with another male and a lone mermaid without our brains being saturated with a whole different batch of hormones and chemicals that have nothing to do with love. So, is mermaid love is different than human love?"

"You have a good point," Pat agreed. "I think the mechanics may be very similar, but CHEW raises the stakes, makes our bonds stronger, a part of our physical bodies, not just hormones in the brain. That's why the death of a pod member causes such pain. The pain is literally physical, according to those few of us who have experienced it. Our mer-bonds are more than just an emotion, like love. They are actual things: waves of electromagnetic energy generated by our mer-organs that fuse us together."

"I don't think CHEW is a thing, it's a force," John said.

"What do you mean a force?" Pat asked, looking up sharply.

"I mean a force like any other electromagnetic or atomic force," John said carefully. "You know, something that makes things spin, glow, heat up, send signals over long distances, or makes bonds stronger."

"The CHEW can be measured, and it's very weak," Phoebe said. "We did it when we saw how the sensors in the Moon Pool recorded our signals when we entered the pool. The only reason it feels strong to us is because we are attuned to it."

"Perhaps," said John. "But isn't the so-called Weak Nuclear Force the one that not only holds the universe together but also what eventually led to the power of the atomic bomb? Aren't we just very large particles that have been bound together by a very small force?"

"Oh, my god, John!" Pat gushed. "You're a genius!"

Harold Matthews debated stepping off the container box and letting himself sink into the ocean. He had been perched on the waterlogged box for the past two days, and he knew that he couldn't last much longer. The storm had tossed him roughly for the first twenty-four hours, and when the sea calmed, he had some hope for rescue. But after a full day of sun, heat, and glare, his thirst was beginning to drive him mad. He lay on his back and watched as the sun slowly set on the horizon, the vast expanse of sea swallowing up the last of the sun's rays. The stars were already beginning to be visible in the azure sky, and it was beautiful, despite his dire situation. No, he thought to himself, despite being a college drop out, Harold Matthews was not a quitter. He would not kill himself this evening, especially if there was any way to get his revenge upon his former shipmates.

He sat up suddenly. Had he heard voices? He couldn't have. The sea was calm, empty, and growing darker. He searched for the other container, but it was hard to see in the growing darkness. During the storm, it had drifted about 100 meters away, and both containers were barely buoyant. Even now, as he sat atop his box, water ran up along the grooves in the corrugated metal and kept his clothes damp with seawater. There, he spotted it in the last glints of sunlight that shimmered across the water! And there WERE people in the water, several people in the water. He could see at least two men and many women.

"Hey," he shouted. "I'm over here."

One of the men turned to look at him, and after a second, as if someone had given a silent signal, everyone ducked beneath the waves. He didn't think he saw any scuba equipment on anyone's back, and although they were quite a ways off, he thought he could see that the women were very beautiful. He scanned the water, waiting to see any of them come back up for a breath of air, but several moments passed, and no one reappeared. He stood up on shaky legs, trying to see the other container in the waning light, but he could see nothing.

Suddenly, the box upon which he stood lurched to starboard, and he tumbled into the water. He felt a brief sting on his leg, and then a growing numbness spread up his body. He was horrified to discover that he couldn't move, and he dared not to take a breath! He was under water. He felt hands push his body up to the surface, and sensed people around him. He couldn't turn his head to look around, but he knew that many hands held him to the surface the water.

"Is he breathing yet?" asked a male voice near his hips.

"No, but he will have to in a minute," a female voice said near his ear.

Harold so desperately wanted to turn and look at the sensuous and sweet voice that was mere inches from his ear, but all he could do was look upward into the sky as it slowly filled with stars. Finally, his lungs felt like they were bursting, and his chest heaved a ragged breath into his body. Another, and a third, and then his breathing felt more normal, less labored, but he still could not move any other muscle in his body.

"Wong," a male voice near his feet said. "Why don't you take your pod back to the sled and start hooking up the containers while we wait for our guest to recover enough for talking. Trixi, did Pat ever talk about how long the mermaid venom lasted?"

"He will be able to talk in twenty minutes," the wonderful female voice by his ear spoke again. "But he will be incapable of any selflocomotion for five or six hours."

Mermaid venom? What the hell were these people talking about? Harold thought for a moment that his thirst had actually driven him mad, and that he was hallucinating everything. But he could feel the hands that held him up, keeping his head above the gently rolling sea, saving his life, which he could still feel pulsing in his own heartbeat. He couldn't move, but he could feel everything. This had to be real. God, he wished that he could move or talk. Mermaids!

"Alright," the male voice continued. "We'll need to find him some water; he looks pretty dehydrated. Is there any in the emergency pack on the sled?"

"I think so," another female voice answered, and Harold felt one pair of hands leave his waist and heard what sounded like the flip of a tailfin as it slapped the water. The remaining hands gave him a very thorough frisking.

"Not armed," the male voice confirmed.

"We stung him for nothing," a female voice said with surprising compassion.

"Always better to be safe, than sorry," the male voice said with equal emotion.

A few moments passed, and the hands held him steady as the stars filled the quickly darkening sky. He could feel the hands of a woman on his head, another set of hands on his waist, and then a final set on his feet. He thought he could feel the woman's naked breasts brush against the back of his head as she held his face above the level of the water. Humans would have been in wet suits, and he could feel the texture of the smooth skin of the woman who held his head. Perhaps there really were such things as mermaids. His reverie was broken when the forth creature returned from the sled with her burden.

"Mark," The female voice said, "float up under him so we can tilt his head up."

Harold felt the hands at his feet shift, and then he felt a body rise up beneath his, and then the pressure grew as the body beneath him became strongly buoyant, lifting his entire body nearly out of the water. He could feel wide and strong flukes curling upward to support his shoulders, and the feminine hands left his waist. The hands on his feet tightened, and then he felt his head rise from the surface of the sea as his body was angled down towards his feet. A glimmer of starlight bounced off the curly tresses of a blonde goddess that appeared before him, and she raised a canteen with Cyrillic writing on it to his lips.

"Relax," she reassured him, smiling and showing rows of perfectly white teeth. "We won't hurt you, but we had to make sure that you couldn't hurt us."

"How do you know he speaks English?" a voice behind him asked.

"I don't," the beauty before him said. "I'm just trying to be friendly."

She pinched his lips, opening his mouth, and slowly dribbled water onto his tongue. He could feel some water slide down the back of his mouth, and he worried that he might choke on the water. The mermaid before him must have seen his eyes widen in fear, because she told him, "Don't worry, your automatic reflexes still work even though you're paralyzed." She was right, because without any effort or direction from his brain, he swallowed the water. After he had drunk a few gulps, he felt his thirst slacken.

"We ready to go," a new male voice with a slight Chinese accent reported. "What we going to do him?"

"Mon dieu! It will only take a very few hours to get back to the caves," a French accented, female voice answered. "We cannot leave him out here to die, and he will not slow us at all."

"Ah, I mean, how are we going to do him?" the male voice asked.

"We can work in shifts," another female voice added as the blonde beauty he could see dribbled some more water into his mouth. "The sled will do most of the work with the containers, and so keeping him alive and moving will actually be the harder task. Why don't you guys take first shift on the sailor, and we'll handle the sled?"

"Fine," the blonde agreed. "Let's get going so we can get him back to the island before the venom wears off."

"When did your friend say he was coming?" Mac asked, tugging at his shirt in the muggy mid-morning air.

"He didn't," Joy said. "Don't look so annoyed. Conjo isn't coming, an unexpected ally is. I didn't expect to have one of my old contacts to know someone so well placed in Mr. Dimaunahan's organization. It seems we may have hit pay dirt; it's Malaki's personal assistant that is coming, and he fears and despises Malaki."

"Good, that man is despicable," Mac said. "So, when is the assistant coming?"

"Soon," Joy said. "You were in the military. You should know the drill."

"Right," Mac said, kicking at the pavement. "Hurry up and wait. I hate waiting."

They stood in Hisbiscus Garden in the Taman Tasik Perdana, one of the oldest parks in Malaysia. There was a three level fountain that cascaded down behind them, and the air was pungent with a rich variety of flowers. The hot air seemed less oppressive here, lighter and more fragrant.

"There," Joy nodded almost imperceptively in the direction of a small man of Indian descent who approached them cautiously. He glanced nervously around the small courtyard, purposefully not looking at Joy and Mac where they stood. After a few minutes of glancing at his watch, straightening his tie, and playing with his thick, curly hair, he finally made his way over to the two Americans.

"The day will be hot," the young man said nervously.

"But not for the flowers," Joy answered, smiling. "They enjoy the sunlight."

"You are Conjo's friends?" the man asked with relief.

They both nodded.

"I am Sudhish Basra," he said, glancing around again. "Why did Conjo want me to meet you?"

"Right to the point," Joy said. "I like that. We know that you are Malaki Dimaunahan's personal assistant, and we know that your sisters Geeta, Rani, and Vidya are being held by him in three different brothel's across Asia."

"What?!" Sudhish exclaimed. "He has taken them all! How do you know? Why haven't my parents told me?"

"I'm sorry you didn't know," Joy said with compassion. "I should not have been the one to tell you."

Sudhish turned away from the American's, struggling to regain his composure. After a brief moment he turned back to face them.

"What else do you know?" he asked.

"Too much to talk for much longer here," Joy said. "Meet us at the Hotel Imperial. Ask for the Johnson party in the main dining room. We can talk over dinner."

"Why should I trust you?" Sudhish asked.

"Because Malaki has tried to harm my daughter, and Alberto and Manalo are dead," Mac said. "We would like to see Malaki dead, a hope I believe we all share?"

"Indeed," Sudhish said, a small, slight smile cracking across his face. "It is a hope we both share."

Pat turned the tiara over in her hands, stunned at the beauty of Rose's handiwork. The luminescent headpiece was a beautiful mesh of filigreed silver strands that sparkled with flashes of yellow, green, blue, and red that appeared to be embedded within the metal. In the center of the tiara there was an intricate weave of tiny strands of metal that looped back and forth upon itself in a pattern that she recognized from their recent MRI's of the mer-receptors in their tails.

"You did this freeform, in the water?" she asked incredulously.

"Eric helped me," Rose said blushing. "He traced the patterns he could see that connected him with his girls, and I interpreted those in the filaments and I used the MRI pictures of our mer organs that you showed yesterday as a model for the centerpiece. The tiara is a ionized polymer of oil paint resins and dissolved heavy metals from the sea."

"How did you know what to do?" Pat started.

"Phoebe helped me there," Rose said, looking over at her other partner in crime. "When you, Galina, and Alexis got stuck with the problems in testing Eric and his pod in the MRI, she got bored and helped me."

"We didn't get stuck," Galina protested. "His readings were not unusual, and we just wanted to see if the phenomena of his vision was based in his girls."

"We're still working on that theory, but we're not stuck yet," Pat agreed. "Phoebe, what did you do to 'help' Rose?"

"I remembered there are large amounts of strong, heavy metals that are dissolved in seawater," Phoebe said. "I just described to her what kind of picture the atomic structures of those metals were, and she would start the ionic pulses in her tail, enticing the dissolved metals to polymerize on the end of her paintbrush. As the metals bonded with the paint, the sculpture just grew in the water in front of her. It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen."

"We're not sure what metals are actually in the tiara," Rose explained. "Because I couldn't really see or feel any of the metals individually, I just could sense that there was something in the water that was attracted to my ionizing waves, and I focused on those feelings of attraction."

"We think that the colors in the metal come from trace pigments in the paint and all the salts and other chemicals that exist naturally in seawater," Phoebe continued. "We think that the final carbon-metal polymer chain has a mix of several metals like nickel, uranium, vanadium, cobalt, and titanium."

"I think I could have forced a purer polymerization," Rose added. "But I thought the colors were beautiful. I didn't really think it would be anything other than beautiful."

"And these things are otherwise inert?" Pat asked, turning to Alexis, who held a matching tiara in her own hands.

"We ran them through every sensor we have," she said. "Nothing, not even radioactivity, though they are highly conductive, nearly superconductive, you might say. They are incredible material; stronger than anything I've ever seen, and yet lighter than I would have thought possible. Excellent elasticity too," she noted as she twisted the tiara into a tight spiral and then let it spring back into its original shape.

"And they intensify our CHEW?" Pat asked. "That is just beyond unbelievable."

"Try it," Alexis offered, as she put the tiara on her head.

Pat glanced around the Moon Pool, noting the expectant looks of everyone. She looked at Alexis, who seemed to be suffering no ill effects from wearing the tiara. A final look at Danni who held Maureen by the fist while Freya hung on her pelvic fin, and she put on the tiara. For a second, she didn't notice any difference, but then she felt a tingling in her tail rise up, move through her body, and ended with a buzzing sensation in her scalp. She watched amazed, as the delicate tendrils of light that danced through the Moon Pool came into focus, playing across the mers and the edges of the pool like an enormous Van de Graaff generator. It was beautiful!

"It's like prescription glasses for our mer senses," she gushed.

"Exactly," Rose beamed.

"There's more," Alexis said. (How about this?)

"What just happened?" Pat asked, stunned. "How did you talk without talking?"

(We are sending electromagnetic energy to one another, which can carry any information, like sound or perhaps the shape of sound if we were actually generating sound,) Alexis sent to her via her CHEW. (I'm not sure how it works, but it works, as you can see.)

(Like this?) Pat thought back at Alexis.

(Yes,) she replied. (We think that we are sending the signals that our inner ears normally send to our brain, which is an electromagnetic wave, after all, embedded within our CHEW's. When our brains get those same signals that it normally translates from sound waves into words, we understand speech.)

"Rose," Alexis said out loud. "Can you please distribute the rest of them?"

Rose nodded to Trevor who distributed tiara's to all the mermaids and slender headbands to all the men.

"I wanted there to be some distinction between the mermen and the mermaids," Rose explained. "So I made the men's tiaras a bit more like headbands. The pattern of the metal still works as an amplifier for our CHEW's, but I thought it looked more masculine."

"I think they look great," Trevor said as he snugged the solid, silver band back through his hair and nestled the front's piece onto his forehead. (And they work great too.)

(Can we all communicate in this way?) Pat asked the collective group as they all donned their headpieces. A collection of affirmations confirmed her supposition.

(Do we have enough for Mark and Wong's pods when they get back?) Pat asked.

(Yes,) Rose answered. (I made enough for five more pods. They don't take too long to make, but the seawater gets tired after a while.)

(What do you mean, tired?) asked Pat.

(There is probably only so much dissolved metal in any given patch of the sea, and it takes time for currents and natural molecular distribution to replenish the supply,) Phoebe said.

(I just know that it gets harder to make the metals bind to the paint after an hour or so,) Rose added.

(Do you get tired doing this?) Pat asked.

(Not really,) Rose answered. (Not any more so than any other activity we've done.)

(Who do those go to?) Pat asked, indicating the two additional tiara's Trevor held in his hand.

(My sisters,) Rose answered. (I made mine, Kate's and Ann's at the same time,) she explained as she reached for the tiara's. (I put these Celtic knots along the temple nodes for ours, in honor of our Irish heritage.)

(Everyone else's are identical?) Pat asked.

(As much as free-hand, 3-D polymer-ionic construction allows,) Rose answered. (The odd thing is how easy it is to get the mer-receptor patterns the same--they just seem to flow from my paintbrush, whereas I had a hard time with the Celtic knots.)

(Let's file that fact away for later. What physical or mental costs are there for all of us doing this?) Pat asked. (And, how do our brains generate the "sound signal" that our inner ears normally hear? Our vocal boxes are not connected to our ears, after all.)

(That's what the rest of this afternoon is for,) Alexis said. (We are going to test the range and limits of Rose's devices and try to theorize why we can talk without talking.)

(Well, Rose,) Phoebe teased. (I guess we're going to have to count you as one of the scientists from now on.)

"Yes," Sudhish answered, as he toyed with his untouched dessert. "I can see the benefits of waiting, but I don't want to see my sisters suffer a moment longer than necessary. Surely you can see that?"

"Yes, Sudhish," Joy agreed. "But this is a cancer we want to end permanently, not just for us and your sisters, but upon all who have been subjected to Malaki's cruelty."

"We cannot speed things up further?" Sudhish pleaded. "Malaki has killed our parents, what keeps him from killing me or my sisters?"

"Both you and your sisters have enormous commercial value," Joy said. "Malaki is first and foremost a businessman."

"Besides, we must let Abao make his run," Mac advised. "If we tip our hand in any way, we will lose the prize we both want."

"How can you be certain that your people will win?" Sudhish asked, playing with his fork as he worried about both his and his sisters' future.

"Nothing is ever certain," Joy agreed. "But we have already overcome Alberto, Tumibay, and Manalo, and everyone agrees that Abao is not the match of even his older brother. We are not worried."

"Well, at least it's good to know that I was right," Sudhish agreed.

"About what?" Mac asked.

"That it was something other than Alberto that had defeated the others," he said with out rancor. "It was your friends. Why can they not now help me?"

"We can help each other," Joy suggested. "Meet us tomorrow and give us all the information on your sisters that you can, and see what you can find out about an older woman who might have been traded by Alberto before he went into hiding."

"What was her name?" Sudhish asked.

"Emma Henderson," Joy answered. "Show Malaki this message from Manalo, and say that the currier from Michael Thompson thinks that she was the last deal Alberto made before he went into hiding, and that she may know something about where Alberto is and why he has been such trouble. Once you know where she is, suggest to have her moved to a port, any port, and we will take care of the rest," she finished as she slid a worn piece of paper across the table.

Sudhish held a barely legible note written on the hotel stationary in which Manalo and Miss Chen had last stayed. It said: "Key ... Alberto ... Emma Henderson."

"I think this should convince him," he nodded. "How will I contact you?"

"Tell Conjo that you need to get a message to Joy," she said.

Emma twisted her flukes counterclockwise and flutter-kicked hard twice, lifting her body out of the water, twisting around Tutu as she and the dolphin arced past each other. Emma thrilled to the weightlessness she felt as her twisting body reached the top of the arc, the warm sun glinting off her shimmering blue and white tail. The gray and white Tutu was spinning right next to her, and in a carefully timed move at the top of their arcs, Emma slapped Tutu's pelvic fin with her own, their wet appendences smacking the air with a sharp retort. Both Emma and Tutu squealed with joy as they sliced back down into the crystal clear water, pulling a trail of bubbles through the lagoon's warm waters. Emma angled her yellow elbow fins sharply, and her upper torso carved a sharp path over towards Tutu. Two hard kicks later, and she closed her fingers over Tutu's dorsal fin, and synchronized her own flukes to the dolphin's. Together they angled up for the surface again, and as they left the water, Emma angled her flukes back so that Tutu somersaulted forward while she did a back flip, both of them spinning in unison, and then splashing back into the water.

Emma was momentarily blinded by her own, thick, rich dark brown hair as it swirled around her as she twisted back towards the shore where the rest of her pod watched her play with Tutu. She sensed Tutu off to her left, and she clicked and whistled "family" and headed for her pod, Tutu falling in beside her. Together they sped through the water, just below the surface, breaking the waves every few strokes to let Tutu breathe. Emma felt her eyelids tighten as her inner membrane rose to protect her eyes from the rushing water, and she marveled at the power she felt as her amazing body raced through the warm water. She loved the way her pelvic fins seemed to guide her wide hips through the water, accentuating her feminine outline as she pushed herself along. Her reverie was interrupted when they both heard MuMu's squeal followed by the "danger" whistle, and together they both turned around towards the outer lagoon where the other dolphin had been feeding.

(MuMu's in trouble,) Emma sent towards her pod, but she could tell that they were out of the water, and therefore out of range of their CHEW channel. Damn, she thought to herself, and wished yet again that their superconductive signals could travel through the less dense air. She arched her back, and rose up quickly, doubling the surface time she might normally take on a breath, and shouted "MuMu!" before she dove back down beneath the waves. She saw Tutu to her left, and tried not to out-swim the speeding dolphin. Mermaids could easily surpass their dolphin friends, but whatever had set MuMu on alert might be better faced with an ally. A few seconds later, she felt MuSu's reassuring presence in the water.

(What's wrong?) he asked silently.

(MuMu sent a warning,) she answered. (I can sense her, but not clearly. There is something else out there with her, large, not a shark).

(Keep pace with Tutu,) MuSu advised. (We will all arrive at the same time.)

MuSu sped through the water, his dorsal fin slicing through the surface as he practically skipped across the waves. Rikki and Cleo raced behind him, falling further and further behind as their more powerful mate flew towards their sister-wife. The all heard MuMu's warning whistle again, and then a new voice - another dolphin's voice - a male dolphin's voice.

Emma pulled up as she came within eyesight of MuMu, pausing as she watched the large gray and white shape that had frightened MuMu. TuTu continued towards her sister, rushing up to her side. Together, they faced the strange male. Emma giggled. All that fuss over a guy. MuSu pulled up beside her and touched her side.

(What's going on?) he asked.

(I'm not sure,) Emma answered. (But that is a male out there. Perhaps the girls are about to get a boyfriend?)

(Hey!) the distant voice snaked down their shared CHEW. (Is MuMu alright?) Cleo's plaintive voice asked.

Emma turned and could see her sisters racing towards them, still far away.

(It's alright,) she said. (It's a male dolphin.)

(Oh,) Cleo thought back excitedly. (Maybe this time they won't chase him away.)

MuSu and Emma watched as the new male swam circles around MuMu and TuTu, whistling and clicking in a happy chatter that the mers supposed was meant to impress the two females. He nudged their dorsal fins, rubbed his pelvic fins along their sides, and kept up a constant chatter. Emma was convinced that TuTu had turned to her with a look that said, "What do you think?"

"Good, girl" Emma said out loud so the dolphins could hear her. Then she whistled "family" as best she could.

TuTu gave the strange male a nudge back, and then suddenly all three dolphins began to play, rub, and nudge each other as they swam away from the watching mers.

"They look cute," Cleo observed as she pulled up next to her pod mates. "What shall we name him?"

"They've been together for all of five seconds, and you've got to have everyone named?" Rikki challenged.

A sudden cascade of happy clicks and whistles filled the water and they all watched as TuTu rolled over onto her back and the new male pressed his belly into hers. They swam in unison while MuMu swam along side them.

"That looks familiar," Emma said, reaching out to hold MuSu's hand.

"Score!" Rikki said. "TuTu finally got laid!"

"I wonder if there is any part of her that remembers being Turi?" MuSu mused as he pulled Emma close to him.

"It's probably gone now," Emma said wistfully.

"Do you miss being Martin?" Cleo asked.

"No," Emma said with strength and conviction. "Martin was gone long before MuSu ever made love to me. And, becoming your twin has been the best thing that ever happened to me," she added as she pulled Cleo into the embrace she shared with MuSu. "I was just hoping that we could ..."

"Are we about to keep ourselves busy while the dolphin's get acquainted?" Rikki asked as she slid in next to her sisters.

"I hope so," Emma breathed as she reached down to stroke MuSu's vent.

"Do you remember our first time?" Cleo asked, as she stroked Emma's hair. "It was so beautiful to watch you change into a mermaid. When you drank from my own breast, all I could imagine was that some day we'd be mothers together."

"Do you want to start now?" Emma asked, with a whisper of hopefulness tucked into her voice. "You've wanted to be a mother for so long now, and you've been waiting for us to join you."

"No," Cleo said, kissing Emma's ears and cheeks as Emma moved MuSu's growing cock towards her own vent. "Not yet. I don't know why, but I know that we should go quite yet."

"Woman's ... uhhhhhaaaaahhhh ... intuition?" MuSu asked as Emma slide herself onto his stiff penis.

"Mermaid's intuition," Cleo giggled as she pressed her own vent against MuSu's pelvic fin, which had started to vibrate.

"We're going to find mum," Rikki said as she twirled her now flashing blue and white tail around all three of her pod mates', causing them to begin to slowly spin as Emma stroked herself along MuSu's length. "Mum always wanted to be a nana, you know. After we find her, then we can become mum's ourselves."

"I ... am ... ever ... your ... servant," MuSu panted as he began to push back into Emma, his own passion building as his three mermaids pressed themselves along his body.

Emma concentrated on NOT looking into MuSu's eyes, even though a slowly growing part of her wanted nothing more than to complete the long wonderful trip into femininity that she had started over a year ago when she first changed from a boy, into a girl, and then moments later, into a mermaid. She turned to her right to face Cleo and caught her sister's eyes even as they fluttered with passion as MuSu's left fin quivered in her vent. They blinked at each other, neither needing to speak, each knowing what the other was thinking. Cleo lifted one hand and brought Emma's face to her own, and kissed her deeply, distracting her sister from what she knew that they both most wanted to do.

Emma moaned softly into her sister's mouth, as she felt MuSu's hands grab her pelvic fins and pull her hips roughly into his own. She could feel the bulbous head of his long, stiff cock buried within her body, tantalizingly close to her womb, her own internal muscles quivering and clutching at that welcome invader. She felt Rikki's hand brush up from her hip, across her slender waist, and along her left breast, finally pulling at her stiff nipple, sending tendrils of pleasure shimmering across her body. Her birth canal clenched as her orgasm over took her, pulsing in great rolling waves of pleasure that warmed her entire body, and ended down in her flukes that were quivering rapidly in the water, adding to the pod's slow spinning. Her breasts began to spurt multiple tiny streams of mermaid milk into the water as her orgasm built, unrelenting and undiminished as MuSu continued to pound into her quivering body. She felt her sisters join her in orgasm, their warm sweet milk mixing with hers. Three twitching and quivering mermaids were too much for MuSu, and he arched his back, groaning as he exploded into Emma, pulsing hotly within her body. Emma's body responded to this new stimulation by cresting in yet another and even more powerful orgasm, one that nearly overwhelmed her as she clung to consciousness, her body shaking violently next to her sisters, little yelps coming from her throat as she vainly struggled for control. Soon, their pod was surrounded by a pale white cloud of mermaid milk that slowly dissipated as the four of them savored the closeness of their union.

Yes, Emma thought to herself, becoming a mermaid was the best thing that ever happened to her.

"Oh, my GOD!" Cleo squealed as MuMu unexpectedly brushed her back softly as she swam by.

"What's wrong?" MuSu asked, pulling himself from Emma much too quickly as far as she was concerned.

"MuMu's jealous," Rikki said languidly, still enjoying the aftershocks of her own orgasm. "I guess the new dolphin isn't as talented as our MuSu."

The four of them were startled by a retort that emerged from both MuMu and Tutu that sounded suspiciously like a snort of derision or laughter. Slowly, all four mers untangled themselves and turned to face the three dolphins. They hovered a few meters from them, looking at them curiously. Then the male dolphin made the same sound as had the girls, a snort that sounded like a laugh.

"Snort," Cleo giggled. "That's his name."

Harold Matthews took another drink from the canteen and savored the sweet taste of the spring water Pat had told him how to find. He had been on the island for two days, and each day he had gotten stronger. Today, he was sitting in the mountainside huts that Pat and John had built so long ago, collecting the fresh spring water that cascaded down the system of bamboo pipes that now needed some up keep and maintenance. He would happily spend the next several days performing this task for his saviors.

He smiled as he remembered his first hours on the island, explaining to Mark and his girls who he was and how he came to be in the ocean. He grew more and more amazed as he learned their stories as well. Over the next two days, he met most of the mers as they brought him some fish and other supplies that he needed to survive. All in all, Harold decided that he had landed in heaven. He was alive, had plenty of food, and the most beautiful creatures in the world came to bring him fish twice a day. This morning, he surprised Mark when he gladly agreed that he could not be returned to civilization because he now knew the secret of the mers. No, he was happy to stay, and he would work for the privilege.

He looked around at his surroundings, and thought about the stories of Phoebe and Michael, Rose and Trevor, all of whom had spent their first moments as lovers here in these huts. Sandi had begun her journey towards mermaidenhood here as well. So many stories, Harold thought to himself. How would his turn out? Would he help start a new pod, becoming a merman to mermaids, or would he lose a battle, as did Rose and Sandi, and become a mermaid himself? He knew that one day he would make the transition, but that it would be because the mers asked him to. After all, he owed them his life.

Well, in the meantime, there was plenty of work to be done. He screwed the cap back onto the canteen, and rose to his feet to begin his inspection of the bamboo pipes. John had explained where he could find some tools hidden away, and where to find particularly tough vines to replace those that had loosened or fallen away. There would be plenty to do while he waited for fate to decide what his next step in his now strange and wonderful life would be.

Abao looked over his crew of six, satisfied that he had assembled a good team. Each man was a natural born killer, and each of them owed Abao his life. Thinking back on his older brother's tactics as a child, Abao decided that Manalo had thought to trick Alberto, and something backfired, which accounted for the strange events in Hong Kong. That was the sort of thing Manalo would always do, rather than simply engage in a stand up fight. Abao was always ready for a fight, and he easily threatened violence at every turn.

His quest to defeat Alberto and his brother had been helped by Mr. Thompson, who had finally decided to cooperate and told him that Manalo had thought to return to Alberto's hide-a-way with the women he kidnapped from the Davao brothels to begin to build a new base of operations in that remote location, away from his father's tyrannical control. Abao was surprised that Manalo had that much courage, but he would not make that mistake. He would surprise both his brother and Alberto, kill them all, and return as a hero to his father. It would take many days to make his way from Hong Kong to the remote island in the South Pacific, but he would be well prepared and well armed.

Hank looked out over his crew of ten, hopeful that he had assembled a good team. Along with his own family were his wife's sister, Julie and her husband Brian. They had been incredulous at first, but when confronted with proof, both Julie and Brian were eager to jump "off the grid," as Brian said, and build a new life as mers. They would worry about the details when they got to the island; Brian had agreed. Some details! Hank eyed Brian again, assessing the likelihood that his brother-in-law might best him in a wrestling match as Trevor had bested his own son. His twin daughters, both destined for Trevor's pod and their transformed former brother, smiled back at him, nodding in excitement.

Further down along the railing was Dr. James Riddles, a retired medical researcher from Stanford that had been one of the foremost genetic scientists before he retired several years ago. Next to him stood Debra Hutchins who was something of an electronics wiz. She could make a computer do almost anything, and she had worked for him for many years. She was selected in part because she shared the same dream Trixi had ... she was a transsexual, and the opportunity to become a fertile female, even if the species wasn't entirely human, was a dream she had long harbored. Finally, Pat's sister, Bridget McDonnell and her lover, Dr. Elise Matthews, stood near the bow of the boat. Hank had first been reluctant to use his "escape" opportunity to ferry Pat's sister, but he felt more confident when he discovered that Elise was a doctor. Although there was significant biological knowledge among the mers, Elise would be the only trained medical doctor.

"Well, we're off," he said as everyone watched the dock hands throw off the painter as the large yacht eased away from the slip.

"It's good to be back on the Freedom III, even if it is crowded with people and equipment," Janice said. "The flight down to Sydney was so long."

"How long to Mermaid Island?" Kate asked, excitement shining in her eyes.

"About two weeks," Hank said. Two weeks to work out with Brian and Julie what might actually happen when they got to the island. Two weeks of uncertainty. Two weeks of hell. How had he ever allowed his wife to talk him into this situation, he thought to himself. He had captained a company from obscurity to one of the top internet companies in the world, and yet here he was, powerless to master his own destiny with his wife.

"Penny for your thoughts?" Janice asked him as she gave him a squeeze.

"Later," Hank said as he worked his way from her grasp and headed for the wheelhouse. It was going to be a long two weeks.

Conjo poured over the data records that he was altering, making sure, for the fifth time, that his own tracks were being covered, and that Malaki would be ignorant of this first step in bringing the criminal tyrant down. Fortunately, there were so many blind corners in Malaki's organization that there would be plenty of blame to go around, and it helped that Malaki's primary system of management was fear. Conjo stretched, his seventy year old body responding effortlessly, thanks to his daily discipline of Tai Chi. Conjo typed a few more commands into the computer, smiling. No one suspected that the evening janitor could possibly comprehend computers.

Sudhish's codes and cooperation had given Conjo greater access to the Dimaunahan Crime Empire than he had ever hoped for, and now he could finally set into motion the longed for vengeance that had secretly dominated his life since Malaki's father had killed his own father during the Second World War, but that was a story for another time. The cursor waited, blinking, and Conjo hit the enter key and picked up the garbage bag, and left the office.

Emma, Rikki, and Cleo practically quivered with anticipation as MuSu stoically waited by the edge of the pool in the recently expanded Lab cave. Phoebe and Pat were working the controls to the short wave radio, trying to hold the wavering signal they were getting from Conjo.

"Conjo, repeat last message, over," Pat said steadily.

The radio crackled with static, as they waited for the response.

"Mother Hen found," the faint voice repeated. "Eggs will lay in two months, over."

"How many eggs can we expect?" Pat asked as the Henderson girls all clapped hands over their mouths to prevent themselves from screaming. "Over."

"Depends on how many wolves get into the hen house," the voice said. "All hens will assemble in hen house in Davao in two months, over."

"Excellent," Pat said. "Two months, Davao. Rodger and out," she said as she switched off the radio.

All three Henderson girls lifted their hands from their mouths and began screaming with joy, then as one, they launched themselves at MuSu, bowling him into the pool at the edge of the room. A happy tangle of fins, arms, and squeals of joy filled the roiling water as MuSu's pod celebrated the good news, MuSu's yellow and black tail barely visible beneath the swirling tails of blue and white.

Phoebe took Pat's hand in her own as they watched the Henderson's hug and kiss and squeal.

"I hope the ending to this story is a happy one," Phoebe said.

"Me too," Pat said. "But there are so many things that can go wrong between now and the start of the New Year."

"It's October?" Phoebe asked. "Gosh, I had forgotten that there were months and weekends and stuff like that."

"It's November," Pat corrected. "The 23rd of November, according to the last message from Joy and Mac. I had forgotten that the rest of the world had seasons."

"Yea, the weather is pretty much the same here," Phoebe said. "Except for the storm season."

"I have a feeling that we are about to get some big storms," Pat observed.

"What? Some thing other than Abao coming?" Phoebe asked. "I thought Joy said it was just Malaki's second son with a bunch of thugs who have no idea what they are in for."

"No, Abao is coming, and we expect him," Pat said. "It's the unexpected arrivals that cause problems."

Kate and Ann lay together on the bow of the Freedom III as the boat sliced through the night sea, their hands entwined as they lay on their backs facing the night sky. Their parents were asleep below, and Dr. Riddles was aft at the helm. The girls slept on the wide deck because the stateroom that might normally have been theirs was jammed full of supplies and equipment for the MMI, as everyone was calling the research facilities buried deep within the caves of Mermaid Island. The original lab cave had been expanded as the mers learned to use various acids, salts, and bio-engineered bacteria to carve out new tunnels, interior rooms, and airshafts. The large sailboat was packed with supplies, equipment, and ten people. If they ran into bad weather, which was likely during the nearly two week trip north to Mermaid island, then the twins would bunk down in the galley on the benches on either side of the table. Tonight was their first night out from Suva, and the novelty of sleeping under the stars was alluring.

"I never get tired of this sky," Kate said.

"Me neither," Ann agreed. "And the smell of the ocean, too."

"Yea," Kate said, drawing in a big sniff of the cool night air. "I love this place, and it will be even nicer to actually be native to this big, beautiful ocean."

"I'm looking forward to cleaning the place up," Ann said. "Did you see all the trash as we were leaving Suva? There's stuff floating everywhere."

"I don't know how we will make much of a difference," Kate said. "The ocean's a really big place and there's only a handful of mers."

"Yea, but we'll think of something," Ann said. "That's why Dad recruited all those scientists to start coming out to the MMI over the next several years."

"I wonder how long it will be before someone discovers the mers?" Kate wondered.

"Sally and Eric already did," Ann answered. "Remember?"

"Oh, yea," Kate agreed. "Joy and Mac too, but those were some very smart people. I hope the mers can be secret for a very long time."

"I hope we get to be mers for a very long time," Ann said, squeezing her sister's hand.

"How many more days?" Kate asked softly, turning to face her sister.

"A week, maybe a few days more," Ann offered tentatively.

"Any regrets?" Kate asked.

"What do you mean?" Ann responded, shifting to face her sister in the starlight.

"I don't know," Kate said, turning to face her sister. "Rushing a sorority, homecoming, the fall Screw-Your-Roommate Dance, hanging out at The Troubadour, losing your virginity, you know ... college."

"Regrets, I've had a few," Ann began to sing softly on of their family's favorite songs. "When I bit off more than I could chew."

"But through it all," Kate sang out more loudly into the quiet night air. "When there was doubt, I ate it up and spit it out."

Together the girls sang, "I faced it all and I stood tall; And did it my way."

As their soft, sweet voices faded into the sound of the waves slapping against the side of their sailboat, they both could hear Dr. Riddles in his elderly tenor continue, "I've loved, I've laughed and cried. I've had my fill; my share of losing."

And their three voices joined together for "And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing."

For a moment the night air filled with the sounds of giggles and laughter, and then from below the deck, the clear baritone of Hank Connor echoed from below, "To think I did all that; And may I say - not in a shy way."

And now all four voices finished, "No, oh no not me, I did it my way."

Then Janice, Julie, and Brian interrupted with, "For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught."

And then Debra, Bridget, and Elise jumped in with " To say the things he truly feels; And not the words of one who kneels."

And then everyone joined in for, "The record shows I took the blows - And did it my way!"

The night air filled with the sound of clapping, laughing, and giggling.

"Nope," Ann sighed. "Not a single regret."

"Me neither," Kate agreed, and kissed her sister soundly on the lips.

"Alright everyone," Hank's voice floated up. "We've got about ten days of steady sailing, so get some rest."

"Yes, Dad," Kate and Ann shouted.

The boat silently sliced through the glimmering ocean, the slight breeze keeping their speed to about 12 knots. The girls lay quietly, listening to the sounds of the sail rippling in the wind, the steady slap of the water against the hull, and the occasional cry of a far away bird. Kate sat up and looked down at her body in the starlight. She was wearing a light sweat suit over her bikini as protection against the cool, night air. She stretched her legs out, pointing her toes towards the bow, imagining a green and gold tailfin extending another foot or two beyond the ends of her feet, shimmering and glistening in the starlight.

"Stop pretending," Ann whispered. "It will only drive you crazy."

"Like you don't?" Kate challenged. "I see you doing that all the time."

"So, what of it?" Ann said. "It doesn't matter what we think it will feel like, Rose said. It's beyond imagination."

"She's not right about everything," Kate said. "Besides, Rose is still learning how to be a girl."

"I wonder how Dad and Brian are doing?" Ann asked conspiratorially.

"Who do you think will go girl?" Kate whispered back.

"Uncle Brian," Ann said. "If Dad goes, then all the Connor men will have disappeared."

"I don't know," Kate said. "Uncle Brian has always been more hotheaded, you know, more like a guy. I just can't see how he would agree to become a mermaid. Besides, he's younger and stronger than Dad, if it came to that."

"Do you think it will come to that?" Ann asked.

"No," Kate mused. "I think Mom and Aunt Julie have something worked out."

"How do you know," Ann demanded.

"I don't," Kate said. "I just have a feeling, that's all. I mean, if we really thought about it, Mom should be the leader of the pod."

"How do you know that she won't be?" Ann asked.

"Oh," Kate said. "Who will be in charge of our pod? Our older sister?"

"Nope, we will," Ann said, smelling the night air again. "Actually, I don't think I care one way or the other, about Dad and Uncle Brian or even who will be in charge of our pod. As long as I have my twin for one of my pod-mates, I think I could handle anything."

"Me too, Sis," Kate agreed, leaning over and kissing her sister tenderly.

"Are you sure that you have everything?" Pat asked worriedly.

"Yes, Mom," Trixi said. "We will be fine."

"Trixi!" Homa said quickly, nodding her head at the edge of the lagoon where MuSu and his girls waited impatiently with Wong's pod for Mark's pod to join them.

"What?" Trixi asked. "Their mother is still alive; Pat is the closet thing to a Mom I'll ever know."

"Actually, Danni would be the closest thing to a Mom you'll ever know," Pat said laughing. "She would be here to fuss over you if she wasn't watching all the children this morning. She sends her love and her warning to listen to Mark, and to really keep an eye on MuSu's girls. They might let emotion take over and that could endanger us all."

"Yes, we know," Binah said. "And we will be careful, and we will listen to Mark, when we ought to, and we will come back with Mrs. Henderson and Sudish's sisters."

"Remember that none of them know who will be rescuing them," Pat worried. "You'll have to keep that walkie-talkie safe and dry, because that's the only way to signal them."

"Yes, Mom," Mark said smiling. "I know a thing or two about keeping equipment dry and usable while working underwater."

"You won't risk anyone to exposure or capture?" Pat asked.

"We are there as a back up measure only," Mark reassured her. "We will let Michael Thompson handle everything, but we are prepared to provide any necessary distractions, cover, or healing."

"You will report back every morning at daybreak?" Pat worried.

"Yes," Trixi said, tapping her tiara lightly. "Everyday."

"It's a bit of a brisk swim to Davao," Mark said. "And we can't swim at top speed, so, we had better get going."

"Yes, yes," Pat said. "Just make sure you bring back everyone ali--oh, sorry," she finished clapping her hand to her mouth.

"I will bring back my whole team," Mark said without flinching. "This time, the stakes are even higher, and I have to believe that I survived Viet Nam for a reason."

"Mark will bring us all back," Homa said fiercely, hugging her mate tightly as they knelt together in the shallow surf. "I know it."

"Yes!" both Binah and Trixi added. "Don't you worry about a thing."

"You have the tracking devices?" Pat asked, looking over the four mers as they swayed in the surf that rolled up to their waists. Each of them had a utility belt that hung around their hips above their pelvic fins. A variety of pouches, nets, and clips clung the belt, as sleekly as possible, and held all kinds of equipment, knives, and even some Russian underwater firearms. Unfortunately, The belts prevented the mers from achieving their highest speeds. Thus a trip that might take a few days unencumbered was going to take a few weeks. However, the emergency resources they provided on long trips into strange waters was worth the extra time. Besides, they would easily reach Davao before the rescue happened. They planned to explore the area and make maps of significant underwater resources.

"Yes," Trixi said. "We've gone over the lists and the plans three times just this morning."

"Yes, yes," Pat said. "I just want to make sure."

"We'll be fine," Trixi promised. "We have to get going, or Wong won't be able to stop MuSu and his girls from leaving without us, and all this planning will be for nothing."

"Alright, go," Pat sighed. "Report everyday!"

"Everyday," Trixi shouted as she twisted her body in the surf and plunged into a wave. Within minutes Mark's pod surfaced near MuSu's and Wong's, and with a final wave all twelve mers waved goodbye to Pat and disappeared into the sea.

"Are you sure that this is what you want?" Julie asked her sister, barely believing what she was saying.

"I'm sure," Janice said, looking at her younger sister. They both shared many of the same physical characteristics but little else. They were both short, petite, brunette, and nicely curvy, though Julie filled a C cup whereas Janice was more a healthy B, a fact that had briefly dominated their rivalry when they were teenagers, Julie a well-developed 13 year old, while Janice at 17 actually looked younger than her younger sister. Although neither sister had yet seen Rose's transformed self, both Janice and Julie could pass for sisters of a young Elizabeth Taylor with the right lighting and makeup. Julie, like her sister, had managed to stay youthful even as she crossed over into her mid-thirties, and Brian often commented on how she looked the same at 35 that she did at 25. The sisters had grown particularly close after Julie discovered that she was unable to have children, and so she devoted her self to her nephew and two nieces. Brian had taken the news particularly hard, because he had long wanted a family, but he loved his wife, and so made the best of things.

"What about Brian?" Julie asked. "I mean, I am happy to share him with you, but well ... how will we get him to help Hank?"

"The important fact for Brian to focus upon is that he will finally become the father that he always wanted to be," Janice continued. "Getting over his homophobia, as far as Hank is concerned is a small price to pay for such a miracle.",

"Yes," Julie sighed. "I can't wait to be a mother, but will Hank want to be a mother?"

"Let's first work on becoming a mermaid," Janice smiled. "Then we can work on motherhood."

"And you think that Hank will come around on his own?" Julie asked.

"Yes," Janice said, smiling. "We have some time, just leave that to me. Patience."

They both looked over the railing at the sea as it roiled past the boat. Janice loved her sister, but knew that she was more like Danni, a mother in waiting. While any pod would benefit from having a mermaid who wanted nothing more than to nurture others, Janice had always wanted more, which is what drew her to Hank twenty years earlier. Janice knew that the mermaids were the real intellectual and moral leaders of this new society, and in the same way that she had exercised a level of power and influence through Hank and his career, she knew that both she and her husband would wield more influence as mermaids. She had carefully watched Pat and Phoebe, Galina, Emma, and Sally and Alexis lead each of their pods and collectively lead the mers. As far as she could tell, the same pattern emerged with the newer pods that transitioned since she had last been on the island.

The mermen were certainly important, Janice thought, and suspected that Julie couldn't wait to be ravished by her husband as a mermaid. Janice admitted silently to herself that she had fantasized about that moment as well, even that it might be her brother-in-law rather than her husband that did the ravishing. The mermen were certainly the sexual powerhouses of the new species, keeping two or three mermaids satisfied, but their natural aggression towards one another, despite their intellectual knowledge that it did them no good to feel that way, diminished their usefulness as leaders in many situations because they literally couldn't control themselves.

"Hey good looking," Brian said as he slid his arms around Julie's waist from behind. "What's up?"

Janice turned to look at her future pod-mate. Brian had the same rangy athleticism that Hank did, but he had been an air force pilot and had the natural swagger and sense of physical prowess that many in the military developed. His dark brown hair was flecked with a touch of gray, which she could see as it fluttered in the wind, and his dark brown eyes matched both hers and Julie's. Brian was a good man, Janice knew, and he was also devilishly handsome in that cocky, still a little boy at heart, sort of way. He wasn't as thoughtful as her Hank, but that was all the more reason why Janice was convinced that Hank should join her as a mermaid, and together they would lead the pod.

"We were just talking about that," Janice answered.

"What's that?" Brain asked. "Me and Hank?"

"And who says that pilots are all swagger and no brains?" Janice teased.

"I'm smarter than I look," Brian said, his mouth twitching with a wry smile. "You know, we could solve this whole mess by just having two separate pods."

"NO!" both Julie and Janice said together, as Julie broke from Brian's embrace. Now, each sister turned, shoulder to shoulder, and backed Brian up against the bulkhead behind him.

"We've talked about this," Julie said. "There is no-one else I want to call my sister-wife other than my sister. We settled that long ago."

"I know, honey," Brian said. "But you know that I cannot agree to become Hank's mermaid; I just can't do it."

"How would you feel about helping Hank to become your mermaid?" Janice asked.

"Seriously?" Brain looked truly shocked. "Hank? He would agree to this? I thought we were going to fight it out, like Trevor and Robbie"

"Rose, now," Janice said. "Fighting is usually the wrong solution to most problems, but men always think that problems look like nails, and they have the right hammer as a solution."

"Sometimes you have to fight," Brian protested.

"And sometimes you don't," Janice said. "You just be patient and refuse to talk about it until after we are on the island. You give me enough time, and Hank will come to you."

"And you want this for your own husband?" Brian asked.

"I want that for my pod-mate, truest love, and first champion of my heart," Janice said. "You men get too hung up on all that macho crap. There is more than one way to be truly in love with someone. Besides, you've always wondered what it would be like, with Julie and I, haven't you?"

Brian shot a guilty glance at his wife and shook his head.

"Don't lie," Julie said. "I've thought about it too."

"You have?" Brain asked, scandalized.

"Oh, for goodness' sake," Julie sputtered. "We have been talking about becoming pod mates for the past few months. Do you think we didn't know what happens in mer-pods, or have you given up all hope of ever becoming a father?"

"I ... er ... I ... just," Brian said.

"No, you didn't," Julie said, taking her sister's hand in her own. "You didn't think it through, did you? Well, we have, and perhaps you should start."

"Well?" Janice asked in sultry tone. "Have you thought about it?" she finished as she pressed her own bikini-clad breast into her sister's.

"Ummmm," Brain said, covering his crotch with his hand.

"Good, you're finally starting to," Julie said, as she moved her own shoulders as well, pressing her breast into Janice's. It definitely felt exciting, and a little weird, but that would all change once they were mers, she knew. "You keep thinking about it, and keep your mouth shut."

Brian nodded, watching his wife and his sister-in-law gently move against each other.

A large, hulking figure sat slouched on a chair in a large luxury bathroom in the Watergate Hotel. Behind him stood an elegant older woman with only slightly graying hair. She was wearing rubber gloves and a smock.

"Hold still," Joy ordered. "You're making this harder than it needs to be."

"This is girly stuff," Mac groused. "I don't want to have my hair dyed."

"I have to dye my hair too," Joy said. "Just wait until we get to the make up," she teased.

"Not gonna happen," Mac stated firmly.

"Wanna bet?" Joy asked as she applied the last of the hair dye to Mac's progressively darker hair. "We have to meet with your people tomorrow, and the military is nothing if not a stickler for normative behavior."

"What the hell does that mean," Mac demanded.

"That you have to look exactly like you did before you left, except for a slight tan," Joy said. "Now shut up and be still."

"Yes, my love," Mac said ironically.

"Any more of that," Joy warned. "And you'll be the next mermaid."

"Ha!" Mac retorted. "Try it."

"Besides," Joy continued. "I have a special effect planned for tomorrow night when we meet Brent and Annette."

"What's that?" Mac asked carefully.

"You just do as I tell you," Joy said with mock sternness. "Or you'll be a mermaid before you know it."

"Yes, my love," Mac said as he ducked.

Hank lay on his back, feeling each crest in the waves as their boat pounded across the angry sea. They were now four days out of Suva and about a week away from Mermaid Island. They were making slow time, the winds were not working in their favor, but that was just fine with Hank. He had begun to dread arriving on the island. How could he have let his wife talk him into this state of uncertainty? He was a man who made decisions, who captained his destiny, and who had just created the world's best funded and newest institute for the study of marine mammals. Of course, he was about to become one of those mammals, but he had assumed that he would be one of the mermen. But Janice, Julie, and Brian had been adamant about not deciding until they got to the island. He turned and propped his head up with his right arm, looking at his wife of over twenty years, who still looked and acted ten years younger than she was.

Janice Connor was a true beauty, he thought to himself as he watched her sleep peacefully. He remembered the first time he saw her, back in college. God, it was such a cliché. He had just run from the Student Union because he was late for class when he plowed into the petite brunette, causing her books to scatter. He awkwardly apologized and helped her pick up her books, and by the time they had gathered her last book, Hank was lost in the dark pools of her eyes, and he never made it to class that day. They had made an odd couple at first. He towered over her with his tall, athletic, blond-haired, blue-eyed, broad shouldered body. He was actually a computer geek on the inside, but he looked like a surfer god on the outside. He was not, however, always successful with the ladies, and Janice had helped him out of his geeky shell. Janice, on the other hand, was a gregarious and vivacious "popular" girl, always surrounded by boys, but she saw Hank's inner gentleness from the start, and besides, he was a hunk, smart, and likely to make a fortune.

Janice cracked open an eye and watched her husband watch her. He always thought that he was in command, being forceful, and taking charge, but in reality, his fortune, his career, and even his children were as much the result of her efforts and leadership as his own. Janice closed her eye and pretended to stretch in her sleep, rolling slightly onto her back so that her small, firm breasts pushed up into her tee shirt. She knew that her petite curvy body drove Hank crazy, and with the storm covering any noise they might make, she was determined to seduce her husband, in more ways than one.

Hank watched Janice's breast rise and fall with her breathing, mesmerized by the round sloping flesh that rose from her chest. He felt his own cock twitch, stirring between his legs. He reached forward with his left hand and lightly stroked the slight indentation of her nipple, making feather light circles around Janice's large nipples. She moaned softly, encouraging him to do more. He let his hand drift over the entirety of her breast, dragging his fingernails over the cotton tee shirt, causing her nipple to stiffen further. Janice rolled fully onto her back and lifted her hands over her head, stretching, as Hank began to lightly stroke both of her breasts.

"Hummmm," Janice said. "Keep going."

Hank continued to gently stroke and squeeze his wife's breasts, watching as both nipples rose up and poked through the tee shirt. He took one and lightly pinched it between his thumb and forefinger.

"Ah," Janice sighed. "You do that so well."

"I aim to please," Hank said, feeling his cock begin to fill with blood. He shifted his hips to allow his cock to rise, but his track shorts stopped it mid-rise.

"Let's get out of these things," Janice suggested as she lowered her hands to the hem of her tee shirt and lifted it up over her head. Hank watched as her breasts bounced free of the tee shirt, now slightly sagging after three children, and her dark nipples had grown significantly when she was pregnant with Robbie.

"Come on," Janice urged, nodding at his shorts as she pushed her own shorts down her slender legs, kicking them off the small bed as she did so.

Hank flipped onto his back and pushed his shorts down, and when they were around his ankles, Janice pounced on him, straddling him over his thighs.

"Don't move," she said, as she reached behind her and took the drawstrings of Hank's gym shorts and tied them firmly around his ankles. "There, now you are almost a mer."

"Kinky," Hank said, his cock straining.

"Like what you see?" Janice asked as she shook her hair over her shoulders and brought her hands up to her breasts, squeezing and stroking them gently as she rocked her hips back and forth on Hank's thighs.

"Yea," Hank breathed, feeling the heat from Janice's sex ebb and flow as she stroked herself closer and then further away from his now aching penis.

"You like my breasts?" she asked as she lowered her torso over her husband's body. "Are they pretty?"

"Oh, god yes," Hank said as her thick nipples brushed across his lips and face as she swung her shoulders from side to side, her hands pinning his wrists to the bed.

"Soon, you will be sucking on a mermaid's breast, changing into a mer yourself," she whispered in his ear as she pressed a nipple into his mouth. "Yes, suck it. Oh, god it feels so good. That's it ... more. Now, do the other one. Yes! Ah, you have no idea how good that feels, my breasts, my life-giving breasts hanging from my chest, feeding you. That's right, suck it more."

Hank continued to suck at his wife's breast while she ground her crotch into his abdomen, leaving a wet trail of her juices.

"Oh, uh, uh," she intoned as she rocked her hips back and forth, pushing her mound into his stomach and hips. A small orgasm over took her, and she squealed.

"Yes, yes!" she cried, lifting her breast from his mouth, savoring the pulses that emanated from her womb. Hank watched with equal parts love and lust as his beautiful wife quivered above him. She refocused on her lover, and she reached down to play with his small nipples.

"It's too bad you don't have anything like these for me to suck on," she said as she looked down at her own breasts. "Maybe we can make these grow," she continued as she pulled on his nipples, causing him to arch his back. "You have been thinking about it haven't you?"

"About what?" Hank asked, his mind awash with lust and the fantasy his wife was spinning for him.

"About breasts," she said, stroking his hairy chest as she resumed rocking her hips along his stomach, pushing against the top of his cock.

"No," he gasped, trying to lift his hips so that his cock could find her wet slit, but the shorts around his ankles prevented him from getting the maximum leverage, and she scooted her hips forward.

"Don't lie," she said as she leaned down and pulled one of his nipples into her mouth.

"Ah," Hank moaned as his wife's mouth bit down on his abused nipple. "Don't ... "

"Don't what?" Janice demanded, moving to the other nipple and lavishing her tongue around his stiff, tiny nipple. "Don't suck on you? How about if I suck on this?" she asked as she reached behind her to grab his cock. "Would that be O.K.?"

"Um ... " Hank floundered.

Janice didn't wait for a more coherent answer and spun her small, light body around, lowering her hips over Hank's face as she deep throated his cock in one, swift gulp.

"Ooohhhh," Hank moaned as he felt his cock head compress against the back of his wife's throat. She slid it out with a pop, and then pushed her vagina into his face.

"Don't you wonder what it's like to have multiple orgasms?" she asked as she felt him tongue the outer edge of her pussy. "I'm going to have several more before I let you have one. Do you think that's fair?"

She ground her hips down as Hank lapped at her wet cunt. "What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?" She lowered her head back to his cock, and toyed with the head, sliding her lips back and forth over its silky helmet. "Ummmm, wouldn't you like to have more than one orgasm?" She hoped that Hank wouldn't remember that all mers were capable of multiple orgasms in a single session, but she had the feeling that he had been avoiding thinking about sex. He was thinking about it now, however, as she felt his tongue dive into her love tunnel, causing her hips to spasm.

"Oh, right there," she ordered as she felt Hank's chin press into her clit. "Oh ... oh, aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh," she moaned as her second orgasm rolled through her body.

Hank felt the gush of liquid flood his face, and watched fascinated as Janice's hips shook with her pleasure. What was she doing to him? Was she trying to get him to agree to become the mermaid? How did she manage to do this to him?

"Oh, Hank," Janice moaned. "You were always the best."

She turned around again, pressing her breasts into his face, rubbing her own juices over her tits. "Your stubble is a bit rough, but if we were mermaids, we wouldn't have that problem."

"Mermen don't shave either," Hank mumbled as Janice's breasts passed back and forth over his face.

"Sure, but can't you imagine what it would be like to be like me?" she asked, ignoring his comment. "Feeling your breasts hanging down, your nipples stiff and sensitive? I love the way my breasts make me feel."

"What are you doing?" Hank asked, feeling a strange pressure in his chest.

"Loving you," Janice said, as she threw her leg back over her husband and stuffed his cock into her cunt. "Oh ... ah, yes. We will ... always be lovers, you and I," she said as she increased the strokes she made with her hips. "No matter ... uh ... what happens."

"I will always ... oh, god ... love you too," Hank said, feeling the familiar feeling of his own orgasm rising up more quickly than he expected.

"Give ... it ... to ... me," Janice urged, recognizing the look in her husband's face. "Do it," she commanded as her hips moved with greater urgency and power. "Yes ... I ... want ... to ... feel ... it!"

Hank could hold out no longer, and felt his gut clench as he spurted his cum into his wife.

"Yessssssss," Janice hissed as her third orgasm rushed to meet Hank's, and together they collapsed into each other's arms. After many moments of listening to the storm outside, Hank pushed a strand of his wife's hair away from his mouth, and let out a sigh.

"What?" Janice asked tenderly.

"Are you serious?" he asked.

Janice lifted up her head and looked down lovingly into the eyes of the man she had loved for over twenty years. She sensed her opening. "Think about it. Which way would we be happier, with you as my sisterwife or with Brian?" she asked.

"Hum," Hank said, looking back up into the eyes of the most beautiful woman he had ever known. "I never thought about it like that."

"How were you thinking about it?" she asked.

"As me not losing my manhood to Brian," Hank said.

"Don't you remember what the mers said about manhood before we left?" she asked.

"No, what?" he asked.

"The mermen are not the ones in charge," she said and lowered herself back down to kiss him soundly.

The two couples sat in a tastefully decorated living room in a modest home in Northern Virginia. A tall, slender woman finished serving martinis to her guests and sat down next to the large man in a navy uniform.

"Cheers," she said, raising her glass. "Here's to Mac's retirement, and not a moment too soon."

The four clinked glasses and each sipped from their glasses.

"It's about time," agreed Brent Dawson, former Commandant of the Marine Corps and an old friend to Mac Bennett. "I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to retire."

"Well," Mac began, "It's a long story, and it's why we wanted to meet you here. You're sure this place is clean?"

"If it's not," Brent laughed. "There will be several heads that will roll."

"Annette, this includes your protocols," Joy said.

Annette Dawson looked at her husband of the past thirty-five years and raised an eyebrow.

"Joy Simpson was E - 9, she knows your file," Brent explained to his wife, a retired CIA officer like Joy. "You were covert, and she was a field op. I never told her."

"But you knew that I was in the Company," Joy laughed.

"I had to," Brent explained. "You were advance for me back in the 70s."

"Oh, right. I remember now. Annette?" Joy asked. "Clean?"

"Give me a minute," Annette said rising. "And no lip from you," she said shaking an accusatory finger at her husband. "There's clean, and then there's clean." Annette returned with a small device that looked like a radio and set it down on the coffee table. She then turned and drew the curtains over the windows on both the front and back of the room. "Now, we're clean."

"I've met with a very select group of upper military and civilian intelligence officers, including the commander general of Blackgate Operations," Mac began. "And there is one last mission that he would like the two of you to consider joining us on."

"I retired, Mac," Brent answered wearily. "I'm a few years older than you, and I don't really think I've got a Blackgate left in me."

"Wait until you've heard everything I have to say before you answer," Mac advised. "And trust me, most of what you're about to hear will seem absolutely unbelievable. But you will have to believe me."

"Well, that's a hell of a way to start," Annette said.

"Joy?" Mac asked, and Joy reached into her purse and handed Mac a plastic bag with a cloth sealed inside. He took out the cloth and began to scrub his face and hair. With each stroke his face appeared to get younger and less wrinkled, while his hair grew darker and thicker.

"Mac," Brent asked breathlessly, leaning forward off the couch. "What's in that cloth? The fountain of youth?"

"There's only make-up remover in the cloth," Mac explained, showing them the dirty cloth. "The fountain of youth is inside our bodies," he finished, waving his hand at Joy who had also begun to scrub off her own make up.

Thirteen days, two days later than expected, or at least that is what the charts had predicted. Hank Connors leaned against the wheel of the Freedom III and looked at the small island on the horizon that rose dramatically from the sea, it's dormant volcano jutting into the northern sky. The rising sun to the east cast sharp shadows across the face of the volcano, dramatically highlighting the crags and fissures that marked the southern face of the mountain. The sharp cry of birds would soon awaken the rest of the crew, but for the moment, Hank had the sea, sun, and wind to himself.

"Morning, Captain," Bridget McDonnell said, Pat(rick)'s sister, as she emerged from the gangway blinking in the morning sun. "What's the forecast for today?

"We've arrived," Hank said simply, waving his hand towards the bow. "That's Mermaid Island, or the Kiribati regional island #399, or the home of the new International Marine Mammal Institute, depending on your preference."

Bridget turned her face to the north and beheld her future home for the first time. Pat's descriptions did not do the place justice. Hollywood could not have created a more picturesque island paradise.

"How much longer?" Bridget asked.

"We'll be in the lagoon there by this afternoon," Hank assured her. "It will take most of the afternoon to get everything situated, and then you can start on the transitions by tomorrow morning, probably, though Kate and Ann will probably go tonight, given what Pat just told Janice last night."

"Transition," Bridget said, her forty-something face breaking into enormous smile. "I still cannot believe everything that you've told me. It's just too incredible."

"It's all true," Hank said without enthusiasm.

"What?" asked Bridget. "Aren't you excited?"

"Yes and no," Hank said. "You know who the merman in your pod is going to be."

"Oh, my goodness," Bridget said. "I'm so sorry. You and Brian haven't sorted things out yet?"

"No," Hank sighed. "It's complicated."

"Not from my perspective," Bridget said.

"What does that mean?" Hank asked warily.

"I've been with both men and women in my life," Bridget explained, sitting next to Hank in a sisterly sort of way. "And frankly, it's better between women than it is between a man and a woman."

"That's not what the mermaids say," Hank said coolly.

"What do they say?" Bridget asked haughtily.

"The mer-bonds changes some things," Hank explained. "And even though all the mermaids have sex with one another, they become very attached to their merman."

"Just as long as I don't have to give up my Elise," Bridget said. "I can put up with any merman, and besides, Dr. Riddles is such a sweet man. I'm sure that we will get along wonderfully as a pod. Goodness, that sounds so strange: a pod."

"I'm told that everyone gets used to it," Hank said, looking over Pat's sister. Bridget was in her early forties, slightly overweight, but she had a pretty face and a generous smile. She had the family light brown/auburn hair, but otherwise looked like a refugee from the 1960s, with her peasant skirt and loose blouse. "Is Elise up yet?"

"No," Bridget answered. "Should I wake her?"

"No," Hank answered. "I'm enjoying this talk."

"You are?" Bridget challenged. "You act like you're about to be shot."

"Can I ask you a question?" Hank asked.

"Sure," Bridget said, folding her hands in her lap. "Shoot."

"What do you think of men who become mermaids?" he asked slowly.

"Wow, you don't mess around, do you?" Bridget smiled. "I got nothing against men; hell, I was married to one. But I've enjoyed both being a woman and being with a woman, so I figure any man lucky enough to switch teams is a wiser person for having played for both sides."

"Wiser?" Hank asked.

"Sure," Bridget said, settling into her topic. "I'm wiser for having dated both men and women. I know more about both because I could see differences and similarities that are otherwise invisible to a purely heterosexual person."

"What differences?" Hank asked.

"Most people tend to stereotype the genders," Bridget explained. "You know, sugar and spice and everything nice, or snips and snails and puppy dog tails."

Hank nodded.

"Anyway," Bridget continued. "There are all kinds of women and all kinds of men, and the usual stereotypes don't do you much good when it comes to any particular individual."

"That's it?" Hank asked.

"Don't sneer," Bridget said sagely. "Tell me how many people you know that actually operationalize that knowledge."

"Um, not many," Hank admitted after a moment's reflection.

"Wiser," Bridget concluded.

They both sat together, watching the sunrise and the island draw nearer.

"What do you think of Debra?" Hank asked.

"She's alright," Bridget said. "The accent is a bit much."

"She's from England, you know," Hank offered. "You can't fault her for that."

"No, no," Bridget protested. "That's alright. It's just that I've never met a transsexual before."

"Ah," Hank said. "Someone on neither team."

"Well, more like the monkey in the middle," Bridget suggested.

"You haven't talked to her much?" Hank asked.

"No, not really," Bridget admitted. "She keeps pretty much to herself. She only really talks to Dr. Riddles."

"He asked that everyone call him Jim," Hank admonished.

"So?" Bridget said. "Have you looked at him? He's more saintly and doctor-ly than Marcus Welby, MD."

Hank laughed softly at that one. "Yes, he does have that air about him. But I do think you'll score more points if you start calling him Jim, and I think he likes you a lot."

"He does, eh?" Bridget asked, looking down at her dumpy, middle-aged self. "Why?"

"Because he is wiser than most of us," Hank said. "And he doesn't worry about appearances as much as most people do."

"True story," Bridget admitted. "I'm lucky that you recruited him and Pat asked you to recruit me."

"It will take all kinds of people to begin this new society," Hank said. "And who knows what the future will bring. We will all just do the best that we can, and trust to the future."

"What, you don't trust in God?" Bridget asked.

"Do you?" Hank returned.

"Well, I was raised Catholic," Bridget began. "But now I'm more spiritual, I guess. What about you?"

"Me?" Hank asked. "I'm not sure. Greenpeace has been the religion of the Connor family for the past twenty years, and we feel a great obligation for environmental stewardship, but traditional religions have not been part of that mix."

"Perhaps that's why Pat asked me to come," Bridget mused.

"Why's that?" Hank asked.

"Someone needs to start a new mer-religion," she beamed; inspired by a possible purpose to her joining the community of mers her former brother had started.

"God help us," Hank muttered to himself, quietly.

Michael Thompson looked over his crew, satisfied that he had made the best choices he could. He had learned that one of his lawyers in the United States who handled sales of his yachts along the east coast was also an aficionado of mermaids. When Michael offered him a opportunity to participate in the development of new maritime law for the International Marine Mammal Institute, Leonard Simon had jumped at the chance. Michael hadn't told him of all the details of the new institute, but Leonard had happily liquidated his holdings and signed onto the project on the hint that mermaids might actually exist. Next to him was Peter LaMond, a retired chemist with hundreds of patents to his name who had come to Hong Kong to live out his life in luxury near the sea. When Michael had explained that it might be possible to live his life in the sea, and that he might recover some measure of his youthfulness as well, Peter had signed on. Finally, there was Elizabeth (Liz) Wainwright, who was an old family friend of Michael's. Liz had helped him raise his children, had been a great friend when his wife had passed away, and was happily the heiress to a large fortune, which was now designated to support the MMI. Liz had also suffered a stroke a few years ago, and had lost the use of most of her left side. Michael had explained that she might have a real hope for healing at the MMI, and that she should come with him.

It was going to be a good pod, he hoped, but Len and Peter were the wild cards. Peter he wasn't worried about because he was older and not physically large enough to pose much of a threat to Michael's own dominance. Len, on the other hand, was only in his forties, and he was not a slender man, though Michael might actually have the benefit of being in better physical shape. Nevertheless, Michael hoped that when it came time, Len would opt willingly to become a mermaid.

Michael thought back over the last several weeks. After he had assembled the list of equipment for the mers Joy had requested, he immediately started the transfer of his business to his sons, Brian and Brendon. The boys, well, men actually, were overjoyed that their father had finally decided to let them run the business. They were a bit mystified by some of the provisions of the transfer, but Michael had allayed their fears with a transfer of a majority of the stock into their names. Then he got another radio call from the mers, asking for his leadership in a rescue operation that would lead to his joining their community if he desired. He desired. He then assembled his crew, and now was only a few days from Davao. He would get a radio call from a mer named Mark, and then further plans would be laid. One of Joy's contacts would hopefully arrange for the people they were going to rescue from Malaki's organization to be at the brothel from which the rich despots (i.e., Michael and Len) would "buy" these women for their own pleasure, which would actually be the rescue. Hopefully, all the pieces to the puzzle would fall into place.

Or so he prayed.

"Danni's back watching all the children," Pat said as she bobbed in the water directly below Hank and Janice. "MuSu, Mark, and Wong's pods are off on a rescue mission, but everyone else should be out here ready to help."

Hank looked out at the growing group of mers as they surrounded his boat, his eyes scanning the seventeen bobbing heads as each mer surfaced. Suddenly, he caught sight of a heartbreakingly beautiful mermaid who looked like a delightful combination of the girl he had nearly bowled over twenty years ago and a young, Elizabeth Taylor. Rose ... his son. His heart pounded in both fear and anticipation, and he couldn't decide if he was happy for Rose or sorry for himself.

"Dad!" the beautiful creature shouted and pulled Trevor behind her as she swam for the boat, her long, feminine body undulating along the surface of the water.

"Janice," Hank said, tapping his wife on her shoulder, pointing in the direction of their new daughter.

"Rose!" Janice said as she waved vigorously at her newest but eldest daughter. "You look spectacular."

"I look like you," Rose said laughing as she drew closer.

"You look like Elizabeth Taylor," Janice joked.

"So do you," Hank said, pulling his wife into a hug and kiss. "Actually, you are even prettier than Elizabeth Taylor ever was."

"Right answer," Janice said, her eyes shinning.

"Can we ... " Ann started.

"No!" Hank interrupted. "We need all hands to unload all this equipment." He looked at his two youngest daughters and saw the disappointment and longing etched in their eyes. "Alright, a quick hello and then back into the boat to help with the equipment. You two will have ... " he started as Kate and Ann both leap over the railing and dove into the water. "Plenty of time later," he finished as they both sliced into the sea. He watched for a moment as his twins swam for Trevor, showering him with kisses, as Rose waited her turn.

"Hey, Hank!" Pat shouted from just below the boat. "How are we going to do this?"

"Carefully," Hank said, turning his attention to something he could control. "The equipment is very delicate, and each case is only modestly water proof. I wouldn't want to have each one submerged for any longer than necessary."

"Why don't you lower one over the side so we can get a feel for how difficult each one will be to move in the water?" Pat asked.

"Right," Hank answered, indicating to Janice, Brian, and Julie that they should get started. "Do you want me to get your sister, she's below?"

"Is she alright?" John asked as he appeared beside Pat.

"Yea," Hank answered. "As far as I can tell. She just wanted to look her best for her new sister, I believe."

"I finally understand that impulse," Pat joked, moving some of her hair from her face and arranging it around her shoulders.

Hank smiled, took another look where Trevor, Rose, Ann, and Kate were floating together, talking animatedly as the twins poked and prodded both Trevor and Rose, admiring their new tails, beautiful eyes, and long, thick hair. He turned down the hatch and walked down the passageway towards one of the staterooms in which they had packed the new equipment for the lab. He stopped at an open door and poked his head into the room.

"Your sister awaits you," he said.

"I'll be right up," Bridget said, turning to Elise, lifting a questioning eyebrow.

"You'll be fine," Elise said. "You look beautiful."

"You only say that because you love me," Bridget fussed.

"None of us are as beautiful as the mermaids," Elise reminded her. "It's quite silly to think that we should compare two middle-aged lesbians to a fistful of mermaids."

"I know," Bridget worried. "But a girl can try."

It had taken them the rest of the afternoon to unload the Freedom III as the boat rocked in the sea along the western face of the volcano. Waterproof boxes that were filled with all kinds of unusual equipment, chemical supplies, and satellite communications equipment were lowered one, by one, into the water where waiting mers would take them down into the growing network of caves, tunnels, and passageways. As soon as they were done here, the crew, minus Ann and Kate, would sail the boat back over to the lagoon where some final equipment for the satellite uplink and some other supplies for Harold Matthews would be unloaded.

Over the last few months, the mers had doubled the size of their underwater home, and now it had nearly all the comforts of civilization. Fuel cells powered electrical equipment in dozens of rooms, solar panels hidden along the mountain provided additional power for the larger equipment, like their new MRI and DNA sequencing machines. Among the many improvements they made was that the only viable entrance to the complex was through the main tunnel that led to the Moon Pool, which had been slowly expanded in an effort not to disturb the delicate ecology of plants, bacteria, micro-organisms, and flora and fauna that had transformed the Moon Pool into a change agent. There were still hundreds of small vents, fissures, and cracks that allowed water and air to circulate throughout the vast complex, but the mers had inspected all of them to make sure that no human could enter their caves through any other opening.

"O.K.," Hank said as he handed down a long, thin, waterproof box to Tuo and Sandi. "That's the last one for the caves. The rest goes to the lagoon. We'll wait for Trevor to get back before we go, thanks Dawn."

"Sandi," Tuo corrected with a smile at his sister wife.

"Oh, sorry," Hank said, embarrassed. "Right, I keep forgetting that you are ... now ... "

"A mermaid?" Sandi asked, smiling up at her former boss as he seemed to get lost staring at her face, shoulders, and breasts as she bobbed in the water. "Don't worry, after you become a mer, it's easy to tell us apart."

"Um, yes," Hank said. He struggled for a moment, wanting to ask a question, but he shook his head and nearly ran into his daughter as she emerged from below. "Oh, sorry, Kate."

"No problem, Dad," she answered, looking down at Sandi and Tuo. "Hi Sandi, at least my Dad can still tell Ann and I apart."

"What about after tonight?" Sandi asked.

"We're done?" Kate asked, brushing her long blond hair away from her face. "Tonight? OMG!"

"You O.K.?" Ann asked as she emerged next to her sister, noting her panicked expression.

"We're gross," Kate complained, indicating how hot and sweaty they both were. "And we're about to be with Trevor and Rose for the first time."

"You're both beautiful," Sandi reassured them. "Trevor and Rose have been talking about today for months. Hank, we'll take this one into the caves and then met you over in the lagoon, alright?"

"Um, yea, sure," Hank answered, looking at his daughters.

"No more virgins!" Ann said smiling.

"That's enough of that," Hank said awkwardly. "You don't need to give me any more details, I'm still your father, after all."

"Dad," Ann sighed theatrically. "You know all about mer sexuality; what's the big deal?"

"I'll deal with it when I'm a mer," he answered. "Now, go get your mother from below, and say goodbye."

"Goodbye?" Kate asked. "You guys aren't coming?"

"No," Hank explained. "First, your mother and I and Aunt Julie and Uncle Brian will be helping Harold Matthews for a few days. We have to set up the new uplink and upgrade some of the electrical systems for the naval gun. Jim and his girls will stay with us on the beach tonight, and transition tomorrow. Second, if we enter the Moon Pool with you, we might start transitioning which would make helping Harold very difficult. Third, tonight is just for you and your new pod, I thought you knew that."

"Oh," Kate said. "I just thought we'd all do it at once."

"You're actually going to be an experiment," Janice said, emerging from below.

"What kind of experiment?" asked Ann.

"It will just be the four of you in the Moon Pool," Janice explained. "Rose invented those new tiara's, and Pat and the others believe that your transitions will be very quick and accurate if you are wearing the tiara when you enter the Moon Pool. That's where Trevor and Rose went just a minute ago, to get your tiara's."

"You mean we are going to be mermaids tonight?" Kate asked breathlessly.

"Yes, if you're up for it," Hank said. "No one will force you to do anything you don't want to do."

"No!" Ann said. "We can't wait! This is great!"

"What about ... " Kate asked, waving her hand over her body. "You know."

"If sex is better as a mermaid," Ann said, putting her hands on her hips and facing her "younger" sister. "Then there is no reason to have sex as a human first, is there?" She turned to her father. "Dad, get over it."

Hank coughed into his hand and looked away, but Janice gave her daughters a smile. "I think the bigger issue is that Trevor is no longer human sized, and you might get hurt if you tried to make love with him while you're still human. I think Ann's right, there is nothing to be sentimental about here. We all know what becoming a mermaid means, right Hank?"

"Yes, er, of course," Hank said, looking uncomfortable. Damn Janice ... she was doing it to him again. "So, come here and give me a hug, and when we see you tomorrow, you'll be a mermaid. Your mother and I will join you in a few days."

"As mermaids?" Kate asked conspiratorially.

"Um, er," Hank stuttered.

"Perhaps," Janice said, putting her hand on Hank's shoulder. "Would that be alright with you girls?"

Both girls shared a look, and Kate looked smug. "We love you, Daddy, no matter what."

"Kate? Ann?" a voice rose from the sea next to the boat. "You two ready?"

The girls rushed to the railing and looked down at two of the most beautiful creatures they had ever seen. Trevor and Rose bobbed in the sea, their tails each flashing red beneath the surface of the water. Rose's tiara sparkled as it sat perched in her rich dark hair, which cascaded down into the water and floated around her shoulders, allowing glimpses of her generous breasts as they rose and fell. Trevor's shorter blond hair was tucked behind his less ornate headband, the multicolored silver flashing in the late afternoon sun. Each of them held a tiara in the air that matched Rose's.

"Oh, they're beautiful," Kate gushed.

"So are you two," Trevor answered.

"Get naked and get down here," Rose ordered smiling.

"Naked?" Ann asked, glancing at her father.

"You're not going to want clothes again," Rose said. "Clothes irritate your gills."

Hank turned away and waved his hand. "Go on, they're waiting for you. We'll see you tomorrow in the lagoon."

The girls both shrugged and loosened their bikini tops, allowing their small B sized breasts to bounce free of the skimpy material. Then, they both reached down and unsnapped their shorts, allowing them to fall to the ground as well. Then, holding hands, they both stepped up to the railing, and plunged into the warm sea, naked as newborn babies.

"Have you two had enough time to talk it over?" Joy asked, as she sat down for lunch in the exclusive café where they had agreed to meet Brent and Annette after they had had time to digest their proposal.

"We agree that it would be both in our country's interest and in our personal interest to form a pod," Brent answered. "We only have to decide on who we will invite to join ours."

"Actually, the plan is for the four of us to form a pod," Joy said, looking carefully and Brent and Mac. "One of you two as a mermaid will give the mermaids a military strategist/leader of their own, especially if the men are operating as a unit, as they must for safety."

"What about you?" Brent asked. "You are just as strategically smart as either Mac or I, and wouldn't it be better if we were in two different pods anyway, spreading the wealth so to speak?"

"I thought that mer-learning insures some level of shared knowledge that makes your argument obsolete," Mac argued.

"Yes, but ... as both of you know," Joy said patiently. "No amount of learning, book or mer, can replace experience and judgment. You two have that in spades. Further, our pod is to become the tip of the spear; that's our role. Along with Mark's pod, who have shown a remarkable knack for such work, Homa in particular, we will be the first line of defense for Mermaid Island. And both of you know that we can be more effective, because we are a relatively small force, if we are largely self-sufficient."

"But ... " Brent began.

"Finally," Joy continued. "Mer-connections would allow us excellent command and control, especially if we disperse to cover more territory. With two mermaids embedded in two other pods, and then our one merman with one other mermaid, we four can exert a unified command over three pods, and if Mark's pod similarly divides, then we have five pods, which is a platoon."

"You've given this a lot of thought," Mac commented.

"It's my job," Joy said. "I know it makes you uncomfortable, but Annette can confirm that which ever of you makes the transition, you won't have lost anything in terms of strategic, military effectiveness if you become a female."

"I would agree," Annette said, nodding. "There are things that I could do because I was a woman, but to be fair, there were things I could not do as well. But it's not my decision to make. You and Mac are the ones who are old friends. I've only known Joy for the last few days, though the more I come to know her, the happier I am to be her future pod-mate. Think of it, Brent, a whole new life, a new purpose, and the youth, strength, and energy to fulfill the mission, and I could finally have a child!"

Joy, Mac, and Brent turned to look at Annette, her face practically glowing.

"Well, it's a possibility, isn't it?" She demanded. "Brent and I couldn't have kids, but now we could."

"That depends on who becomes the other mermaid," Brent said darkly.

Rose gently snuggled the tiara into Kate's hair, brushing a wet strand away from her face as she tread water in the open sea.

"Why does your hair look so good?" Kate asked. "It doesn't stay plastered to your face."

"Because it's hydrophobic," Rose said. "And soon yours will be too."

"Right," Kate said nodding as she felt the delicate metal headpiece press lightly into her temples. "I forgot about that."

"Don't worry," Trevor said as he positioned a matching tiara onto Ann's head. "Mer-learning helps us remember more than I thought possible, even from mers that we aren't bonded to."

"God, you're so beautiful," Ann said to Trevor, as she held onto his broad strong shoulders, letting him keep both of them afloat. "Your eyes are just amazing," she said as she traced her fingers along his handsome face, running her fingers over his eyebrows. "You're even better looking now than when Kate and I were twelve."

"You two have improved dramatically since then as well," Trevor laughed. "But now, I'm really glad that I don't have to pick between you two."

"Two?" Rose said, arching an eyebrow.

"Three!" Trevor agreed. "I get all three of you. I couldn't be luckier!"

"Luckier than MuSu?" Kate asked.

"What do you mean by that?" Trevor asked.

"He has triplets," Ann explained. "Kate worries that twins aren't good enough."

"We could be triplets," Kate said, glancing at Rose. "If that's what you like."

"No!" Trevor and Rose said together. Kate and Ann looked at Rose with surprise.

"No, you should be yourselves," Rose argued. "Both Trevor and I have been waiting for you two for a very long time."

"It's hard to explain," Trevor began. "Well, I ... I have always, well, I have always loved ... both of you. Seriously. It was hell and heaven at the same time. So, when your brother transitioned into Rose, part of the changes that happened because of my influences over him was that Rose developed a longing for you two, just the way you are, the way I have always remembered you—the way that I have always wanted you."

"I dreamed that you had the same crush on me that I had on you," Ann said. "Now, I know that you did," she said as she kissed him deeply for the first time.

"Exactly," Rose said as she drew Kate into a full body embrace and kiss.

Kate felt her new sister's tongue push into her mouth, and allowed her body to be supported in the water by her mermaid-sister. She could feel Rose's tail as it gently pushed back and forth, keeping them balanced as Rose's swim bladder kept them afloat. Every now and again, Kate could feel Rose's black mid-tail fins brushing against her ankles. Mermaids were long, Kate thought to herself, and soon she would have a tail of her own. She felt her own breasts press into Rose's larger ones, and she wondered what it would feel like to have such beautiful, full, breasts. Rose's nipples were much larger than her own, and they poked her own tender flesh in a very exciting way. Kate thrust her own tongue into Rose's mouth, and hugged her sister fiercely. Rose moaned into the kiss as Kate's hands pressed into her sensitive gills.

"We have waited so long," Rose said as she broke the kiss with her sister. "And we're going to have to wait a few moments longer."

"What?" Kate asked, pouting theatrically. "You don't want me to be your sister-wife?"

"Three things need to happen in a very short period of time," Rose explained. "First, we have your "first feeding" in some canteens near the cave entrance, and that will help you develop the proto mer-organs that are at the heart of not only this experiment but also everything that the mers have become. Second," she continued, lifting a second finger with her other hand, "you will need to allow enough time for the siren cell to be established in your bodies so that the Moon Pool itself is not the only change agent; we don't want you turning into an eel or something else."

"No," Kate agreed. "I want to be a mermaid."

"And you will," Rose answered reassuringly. "Finally, you need to wait until Pat has told us that the sensors and instruments are ready to record your transformations."

"So, let's get to the canteens," Ann urged, feeling her body press against only a portion of Trevor's long body, wishing that she could twirl her own tail around his, and that she had the mer-organs to accommodate his merman's penis within her new body. She satisfied herself by wrapping her legs around his waist, and pressing her naked body to his still closed vent. The feelings that rocketed through her body surprised her, and Ann felt the pressure of an orgasm begin to build in her stomach.

"Easy, now" Trevor advised. "Save some for later."

"There will be plenty for later," Ann heaved, humping his scales, feeling her mons press against his unnaturally smooth, nano-textured skin covering his hips. "I've waited for six years for this moment."

"Me too," Trevor agreed. "There was always something about the two of you, and Robbie was never my type."

"And now?" Rose challenged.

"Rose, you know how much I love you," Trevor admonished. "So, why do you even question it?"

"A girl needs some reassurance," Rose countered, looking to Kate for some support.

"Yes," Kate admitted. "We do."

"I just wish that we could make love right now," Ann growled, feeling her sexual appetite gnaw within her like a hungry dog. "You know that we've been saving ourselves for you?"

"I thought as much," Trevor admitted. "You two were always so sweet and sexy, but never slutty. I'm glad it's worked out this way. I really do love you girls," he finished looking around at all three.

"Well, you could make love to him now, but it would be hard," Rose said.

"Yes, Mom said that Trevor would be too big," Kate agreed.

"No, that's not the problem," Rose countered. "The problem is that you don't have gills, and we would have to keep your heads in the air."

"Trevor could fit?" Ann asked. "OMG! He could not!" she said as she felt Trevor's nearly eleven-inch penis emerge from his vent, poking between her knees. "He's huge."

"Yes," Rose said. "And it's wonderful. But, he's still a lot smaller than a human child, and what goes out ... can go in, but it takes a lot of work. Having the siren cells in your body makes it even easier. Ragi and Timi were able to make love to Bill when they were still human, but they had just changed from men into women, and their bodies were filled with siren cells."

"The real problem is the air," Trevor said, enjoying the feeling of Ann's soft legs rubbing against his stiff cock. "We can kiss," he said, putting action with words, leaving Ann breathless. "But I'm just above your knees, and I would have to raise myself up, keep you afloat, and do a proper job of making love to you, which is possible, but not very romantic."

"Sort of like making love in a sports car after prom," Rose said. "What?" she demanded as everyone looked at her. "Me and Evelyn Walker, my senior year."

"I knew it!" Kate said.

"It was awkward, difficult, and unsatisfying," Rose concluded. "Out here, we don't need to hide from anyone, and the ocean is one, gigantic water bed for us."

"We could go to the Transition Cave," Trevor added. "Which has a very soft, sandy floor, but we would have to pass through the Moon Pool to get there, and that would ruin the experiment."

"Besides," Rose added. "Sex really is better as a mermaid."

"Let's get started," Ann said, her chest heaving. "Where are those canteens?"

"John, can you hand me that cable?" Pat asked as she rearranged several of the pieces of equipment that had just been unloaded from the Freedom III.

John handed her the cable from under the table where he had slithered his long body, keeping track of the many wires that snaked from one box to another. Around the lab cave other mers worked feverishly preparing equipment, running tests, darting from computer screens to the pool so they could communicate with their pod-mates who were in the Moon Pool and other parts of the complex re-attaching connections, re-adjusting sensors, and generally running around doing the bidding of Pat, Phoebe, Galina, Alexis, Sally, and Eric. Bill and Tuo's pods were in the lagoon with Harold helping unload the last of the equipment from the boat, and Liga was watching all their baby mermaids in the lab pool, and served as their primary CHEW channel operator.

"Liga, ask Danni to swim by node 77 again," Pat asked as she finished connecting the table.

Liga ducked under the water and relayed the message, while Pat and Phoebe watched one of the computer screens intently. Liga popped back up with a squirming Freya in her arms.

"When ever I send a CHEW to a mother, their daughter wants to follow the signal," Liga complained.

"We'll try to figure that one out after we finish with the Connor twins," Phoebe said without lifting her eyes from the computer.

"And ... third pass," Pat said, nodding with satisfaction. "Tell Danni to high-tail it back here. Galina, how are you doing?"

Galina raised her head from a tangled mound of wire, computers, boxes, and gauges on the far side of the lab. "Two minutes, hopefully. Liga, can you ask Petra to release again?"

Liga ducked under again, (Danni, Pat said the sensor on the main tunnel is working now, so come back, and catch your daughter on your way back here, I'm letting her go.)

(Thanks, Liga,) Danni replied. (I'll be right there.)

Liga released the squirming Freya and hunted down Michelle and gathered her up into her arms. (Petra, can you and Xing release more mermaid milk into the pool?)

(Yes,) came the reply back.

Liga resurfaced and surveyed the lab while she waited for her next message, Michelle squirming in her arms. Tiny LED's were strung throughout the ceiling and walls of the cave, casting an even glow of cool, blue-white light everywhere. The cave had been expanded both outward and upward, and the pool was now tiered, with a wide shallow shelf that led to a ramp so heavier equipment could be rolled in and out of the water. Sally and Eric hunched over an impressive video system that now showed several views from cameras mounted at the bottom of the Moon Pool, one from each of the cardinal compass points around the middle of the pool, and one from the cave above the surface of the water. Alexis had curled her pink tail under her table where she watched a variety of computer screens that showed a cascade of numbers and graphs that twitched and moved as the data stream from a variety of sensors was tabulated and merged into graphical information. Pat and Phoebe both sat an consoles that had wires that ran from their tiara's to a small box that blocked any out going signals from the mermaids, but allowed them to monitor the changes in CHEW that they hoped their new computers would be able to map and record.

"Emma would be jealous," Phoebe mused as she looked out over all the new equipment.

"Emma couldn't care less," Pat countered. "She is going to rescue her mother. I think that will fully engage her attention."

"I just meant that she would have wanted to play with some of these new toys," Phoebe said. "I'm also just worried about her."

"She'll be fine," Pat said, turning around to re-adjust the settings for the data capture. "MuSu is perhaps the most skilled martial arts fighter of anyone, and Mark is an experienced leader."

"And Homa will destroy any one or any thing that even looks cross-eyed at her new family," John joked as he slid out from under the table. "That girl's eyes are pure danger."

"Ready," Galina reported from behind her station.

"Liga?" Pat asked.

Liga ducked back under the water as Danni rose past her, carrying Freya, Cynthia, and Maureen in her arms. (Alright everyone, we're ready,) Liga sent out. (Petra, Xing, Gabriel, come on back. Don't forget to corral Michelle and Bao on your way. Trevor and Rose, we're ready when you are.)

"Rose, Kate, Ann, they're ready," Trevor reported as he resurfaced next to Rose, who was floating on her back, her breasts lolling in the gentle motion of the waves. "How are you two doing?" he asked, looking up along the rocks behind his head.

"Good," Kate reported from her perch on a rocky shelf on the cliffs that rose from the sea above the entrance to the main tunnel. "My back itches," she continued as she turned around, showing the patches of red and pink that ran down either side of her spine from her shoulder blades to just above her pelvis.

"Mine too," Ann said as she clambered along the shelf to get closer to her sister. "How long have we been out here?"

"Time, eh?" Rose teased. "We don't worry too much about time out here; no watches," she finished waving her empty wrists in the air.

"I'd say only a few hours," Trevor said. "You two warm enough?" he asked, looking out at the setting sun.

"The rocks hold the heat for a long time," Ann answered. "What now?"

"Move over," Rose said as she let her tail sink and returned to a vertical orientation. She waved her hands at Ann, indicating that she should create a space between herself and her twin. When there was enough room, Rose twisted away from the cliff, swam a quick circle underwater, and smoothly rose from the water and landed with a soft, plop, between her two sisters. "Normally, there is a small ceremony that we have done in the Moon Pool, but because we are doing this particular experiment, we're going to do it here. You both realize what you're about to do?"

"Yes," they both answered.

"What do you desire?" Rose asked, looking back and forth at each one of them.

"I want to be like you," Kate said, her eyes shinning.

"I want a tail," Ann said, her slender body quivering with excitement.

"Then drink from me, and take your tails," Rose said as she arched her back and thrust her breasts out towards the setting sun, holding her arms out, ready to embrace her sisters.

Both girls looked at Rose's beautiful breasts in awe, conscious of the power hidden within the pink flesh, the light traces of blue veins visible beneath the smooth skin. Ann could see that Rose's nipple was already oozing milk in preparation for this task. She turned on her hip, rested one elbow on Rose's pelvic fin, and lowered her mouth to the large nipple. She felt her sister's hand support her head as she moved to her breast, and as the nipple brushed past her lips, Ann closed her mouth over the slight dome of Rose's areola. The milk that gushed into her mouth tasted sweet and clean, unlike the slightly salty milk they drank from the canteens several hours ago. She could also feel her sister's head brush against her own as they both fed from Rose. For many long minutes, they drank together while Rose hummed softly above them.

"That was beautiful," Kate said as she pulled away from Rose's breast. "That tasted so much better than before."

"That's because the canteens were mixed," Rose said as she savored the wonderful feelings that ran through her body in the wake of feeding her sisters.

"Mixed with all the mermaids?" Ann asked as she lifted her own head reluctantly from Rose's breast.

"Mixed with all the mers," Trevor said, as he propped himself up on a low, wide rock that was half in and half out of the water, his long cock already emerging from his vent. "Are you ready for me?"

Ann looked down and understood both what had been mixed in the canteens and what her next step must be. Rose pushed herself off the shelf and dove gracefully back down into the water below. Ann scooted across the rocky shelf, swung around her sister, and then began to clamber down the rocks towards Trevor. "Come on, Kate," she urged. "If we share, it will go quicker."

Both girls scrambled down to where Trevor reclined on the rock, one on each side of him. Kate stared at the long shaft that throbbed with Trevor's blood and warmth, while Ann reached out and ran her fingers along the length of his thick cock, nearly as thick has her own arm.

"Trevor, will you give us our tails?" Ann asked.

"Drink from me, and receive your tails," Trevor said as he lay back and let his cock fully rise, pointing stiffly into the sky.

Both girls leaned down and kissed the head of his penis, tasting both the salt of the sea and Trevor's own musk. Together they worked their way, kissing and licking down to the base of his cock, where his black and red vent now pulsed with blood. Trevor groaned, "I won't take long, be careful."

"He will have six or seven spurts," Rose warned, remembering her own transition, "right from the start, so pass it back and forth quickly."

Ann nodded, and moved quickly to the top of his cock, looked her sister in the eye, and then sucked as much of him into her mouth as she could. Trevor immediately erupted with a massive spurt that splashed down Ann's throat. She nearly gagged, but lifted her head and pushed his stiff cock towards Kate. Kate nearly bumped her head against Ann's as she caught the start of Trevor's next spurt on her chin, but quickly stuffed the head in her mouth. A third squirt erupted down her throat, nearly choking her, and she passed Trevor's magnificent organ back to Ann. Ann got in two quick strokes with her mouth before Trevor erupted a forth time, groaning with passion as each spasm tore through his lower abdomen and tail. His volume was going down, but it was still considerable. Ann gave him another stroke and took his fifth spurt before passing him back to Kate. Kate devoured him, and bobbed both her head and her hands as she coaxed a sixth and then a seventh and final spurt from the now delirious Trevor, his tail was quivering like an eggbeater in the water, frothing the surface of the water as his body shook from the power of his orgasm. Together, the twins kissed and licked Trevor's slowly softening cock as he twitched and moaned beneath them. Finally, he was still.

"How do you feel?" Rose asked from the water where she could barely contain herself, watching the incredible sexuality that oozed from her pod-mate and sisters.

"Ahhhh, great," Trevor sighed.

"I wasn't asking you, silly," Rose giggled.

"Wow," Kate said.

"Yea," Ann agreed. "I can feel your milk and his cum moving through my body. It feels so, I don't know, powerful."

"They're definitely ready," Trevor said as he sat up, looking at the twin's backs. "I can see gill fronds."

"The tiara's work," Rose said. "They're transitioning much quicker."

"What kind of tails do you want girls?" Trevor asked, patting them on their naked butts with a gentle caress.

"Irish Green with gold highlights along the fins and flukes that match yours," Ann said as Kate nodded, looking at Trevor's powerful red and black striped tail with its nearly metallic gold coloring along his fins, flukes, and dorsal fins.

"Great, let's get going," he said as he pushed them gently into the water. "If you feel the need to breathe as we pull you through the tunnel, just kiss us. Rose, you take Kate?"

"Yes," Rose said as she reached for her sister. "Green and gold it will be."

"They passed the first sensors," Galina reported. "Are you registering two or four?"

"Two primaries," Phoebe reported. "And two secondary's. The proto-mer organs in Kate and Ann register, but just barely."

"What's happening for you?" Pat asked over her shoulder where Eric and Sally monitored the video equipment.

"All systems normal," Sally reported. "Have a clear and steady picture and clean audio."

"Alexis?" Pat continued.

"All biologics are up, cycles are steady," she reported, her pink and white flukes twitching along the floor with anticipation.

"Here we go," Pat said softly, watching her computer screens as the sensors tracked the movements of the four individuals as they made their way steadily down the main tunnel.

The tunnel glowed with a soft, bluish green light, the strands of seaweed stretching across the rocks like holiday lights. Kate let her self be pulled along by Rose's steady strokes, her body undulating with hers as she pushed them both down the long, wide, tunnel. She was holding her breath, but she didn't feel any pressure in her lungs, and she hoped that her gills were working. She didn't want to slow them down by taking time for a breath from Rose. She turned her head and saw Ann and Trevor as they moved down the passageway next to her. Trevor's longish hair flowing over his shoulders and half-way down his back as Ann's relatively shorter blonde hair fluttered in the water. Ann smiled at her and gave her the thumbs up, which Kate returned.

Kate could sense the water getting brighter, and then suddenly they emerged into the center of the Moon Pool. The dim light of the evening sky above barely visible through the chimney opening high over head, its feeble light nearly overwhelmed by the illumination from the plants within the pool. Rose released her and gave her a look. She thought she could feel a tingling along her tiara, but it quickly disappeared.

"You need to breathe?" Rose asked out loud, since Kate couldn't hear her CHEW yet.

She shook her head, not willing to let any air out and risk having to rise to the surface. She smiled and nodded, feeling the warm water of the Moon Pool caress her body. Next to her, Ann rose in the water.

"We are going to be right here," Trevor said. "Just below you. Concentrate on your tails, and try to feel the thoughts we are sending to you," he finished, tapping his headband.

Both mers sank so that their heads were even with the girls' knees, and together they began to hum.

Back in the lab, the sensors indicated a sharp rise in activity, and the lab grew quiet as everyone watched their instruments, while Petra, Xing, and Gabriel watched Sally's video. The pool began to glow as the billions of micro-organisms sensed Kate and Ann in their midst. Alexis' and Galina's instruments began to show staggering amounts of activity, the tiny creatures building up energy and momentum in only a few minutes.

In the Moon Pool, Kate relaxed as she felt Rose's hands begin to stroke her legs, feeling the warmth of Rose's milk and Trevor's cum spread from her belly into her body. As the pool began to get brighter, she began to feel a tension in her legs, and she stretched them down towards the bottom of the pool. She could see Ann do the same, and she felt Rose turn her body so that she and Ann faced one another. Below them, Rose and Trevor continued to hum and stroke their legs. Slowly, she felt her skin begin to tingle, as if thousands of tiny hairs were brushing up against her, and the tingling grew inward, warming her muscles and making her belly jump, as though she had been tickled. In her crotch, she could feel a tingling grow from within her, and she tried to open herself up to the pool, to her pod-mates, to her sister who hung in the water across from her.

The water seemed to grow denser, heavier, as though it was pressing in on her, but she didn't feel panicked. Her legs grew even stiffer as she felt her body begin to be controlled by the forces both within her and within the pool itself. Her arms raised out from her sides as her spine became erect, and she could see Ann's body assume a similar position. The water around her caressed her, seeming to her like a giant, velvet hand. She could still feel Rose's hands on her legs, but just barely. The sensations from within her body were beginning to overwhelm those from without.

"Mark one," Alexis said as the first micro-burst flashed across her sensors.

"Copy," Pat said, punching a button on her own console.

"We are at four primaries," Phoebe reported. "Our top mer-organs appear to be our CHEW organs. Kate and Ann show only eight centimeters of bioelectrical organs at the top of their pelvic bone, whereas Rose and Trevor both read above 35 centimeters, most of which extend into the tail."

"Copy," Pat said.

Kate looked at Ann, and saw that the walls of the pool were moving. No, that wasn't right, she thought, barely able to concentrate as the feelings of power building within her body rose higher and higher. They were moving, very slowly, but they were spinning around, each anchored to an invisible compass point halfway between them. She saw that Rose and Trevor had backed away, and were watching them from a few meters away. Both appeared to be humming, but Kate could hardly hear them over the sound of millions of tiny "ploinks" that surrounded her as bubbles began to rise all around her. Soon, she could barely see Ann, but her body was now being caressed by millions of tiny bubbles that seemed to burst from her own skin and then rise to the surface above.

She felt a great urge to push, and she bore down with her abdominals and leg muscles. She could feel that the nerves that signaled that one leg was touching another had disappeared, and she knew that her legs had fused. It was happening! Great waves of sensations rolled in and out of her body as the bubbles grew in intensity, and she could sense for the first time the growing connection between her and Trevor and Rose. She pushed again, feeling a great pleasure spasm through her lower torso, better than any orgasm when she had masturbated, and felt her hip bones expand slightly outward as her body assumed a more dramatically feminine shape. Her hair also brushed against her ass for the first time, and she knew that her hair was becoming hydrophobic, just like Rose's. The bubbles were a blizzard around her, and now she could only see glimpse's of Ann, but she could feel her twin more strongly with each passing moment, and she could sense that Ann was changing in time with herself.

"Mer-organs complete," Phoebe reported.

"This is incredible," Alexis said.

"What's happening?" Pat asked sharply.

"The energy the micro-organisms are creating is off the charts," Alexis said. "Where are they getting all that energy?"

"That's what we're trying to figure out," Pat reminded her. "Galina?"

"Can't get clear readings on anything other than skeletal, but we still do not have union at mid or lower tail as yet, but pelvic shifts are complete and proto-fins are visible," she reported.

"Video?" Pat asked.

"Not going to be very useful, I'm afraid," Sally reported. "Too many bubbles, but it sure is pretty."

"Their CHEW is off the charts," Phoebe reported. "It must look like the forth of July in there."

"What's the forth of July?" asked Galina.

"She's kidding," Pat said as Phoebe started to answer. "Pay attention to your monitors."

Trevor and Rose watched in awe as tendrils of green, gold, and red began to snake from their own bodies into the swirling maelstrom of bubbles in the center of the pool. It did indeed look like the finale of a fireworks display. They kept concentrating on the twin's new tails, and kept up their soft humming.

Kate could feel her thighs snap as her femurs formed two new joints in between the now three separate bones, the pain was sharp but was quickly overwhelmed by the siren cells that had multiplied in her body. She could also feel her breasts grow heavier as they expanded away from her chest. Her nipples felt stiff and wonderful as millions of bubbles caressed her slowly growing breasts. That pleasure was offset, however, as a new bone fused her knees together, and her calves felt empty and achy as the siren cells harvested her fibulas for use in her new bones, fins, and flukes. She could feel her tibias break into six different pieces, and that seemed to hurt more than her hips or thighs. That discomfort quickly passed as she felt her ankles fuse together as her toes began to lengthen. Her tail ... she was growing her own tail. The bubbles still surrounded her, and she couldn't tell which direction she faced. She could tell when she passed Trevor and Rose because she could now "see" them clearly with her mer senses.

She felt a new sensation along her skin as the texture and color of her skin began to change, shifting towards a brilliant green along her tail, rising from her newly formed flukes up to her wider hips, which now sported pelvic fins that were tinged in gold. She felt her dorsal ridge rise along the back of her tail, making her mer senses clearer and stronger, and she could feel a great wave of energy rise from her lower back and spread outwards through her whole body, making her fins, flukes, hands, and hair tingle as it left. She was aware of fins along her elbows and hips and knees, and her flukes were now wide and strong, and she could feel the water flowing over her fringes.

"Merdocrine system complete," Phoebe reported, her sensors indicating that the delicate web of filaments that connected to their mer-organs had spread throughout Kate and Ann's bodies.

"Organics at peak activity," Alexis reported. "And 70% drop, mark."

"Transition complete, mark," Pat said.

The bubbles seemed to just disappear, and Kate felt her body gripped with an intense spasm, causing her tail to arc back up over her head. As her eyes finally focused, she could see that she was eye to eye with Ann, and that their tails were nearly touching, each of them quivering with pleasure as the final throes of their transformation coursed through their bodies. They both relaxed, their long tails sinking below their torso's, as they each looked the other over.

They were still twins, their blonde hair seemed more golden and reached down to the top of their iridescent, green tails, and their blue eyes were now bright, cerulean jewels of sparking light. Their bodies were now the more mature shapes of mermaids, their wide hips supporting gold tinged pelvic fins, their long slender, green tails flashing with inner lights as they hung in the dim light of the Moon Pool. Kate saw that Ann's breasts looked slightly larger, and looked down to see her own identical breasts, now tipped with mature nipples that were stiff with anticipation.

Kate looked over at Trevor, and saw the same desire reflected in his eyes. She glanced at Rose and saw the exact same passion, and was surprised herself at the easy and guilt free feeling of desire that washed over her as she devoured the beauty of her former brother and now sister wife. She saw Rose's eyes flicker over to Ann, and Kate turned back towards her sister. She pushed herself with her fins towards her sister, wrapped her arms around her as she gathered her into a kiss. Kate felt her own breasts push into Ann's and marveled at the fullness she felt. Her lips met Ann's and they kissed deeply, their bodies melding into one another's. She sensed Trevor and Rose and they moved to the center of the pool, joining them.

"Who goes first?" Ann asked as she pulled away from the fin-curling kiss she had shared with her sister wife.

"You," Kate breathed. "You're older."

"By one minute," Ann said, smiling. "Thanks, sis. I love you."

"You'll pay me back sometime," Kate answered with a wry smile.

"You won't miss anything," Rose said, reaching out to caress Kate's face. "There is a reason why there are three mermaids to each merman. Watch and learn."

Rose maneuvered Kate to the other side of Trevor as he reached out for Ann. As Ann shared her first kiss with Trevor as a mermaid, Rose positioned herself over Trevor's pelvic fin, and pressed her vent into him. Kate quickly caught on, and wiggled her hips until Trevor's other fin was lodged firmly between her own, swollen but still virginal lips. As Trevor's penis re-emerged from his vent, Kate savored the wonderful feelings of Trevor's fin vibrating along her newly formed vent.

Ann looked down between her larger breasts and studied Trevor's cock that was pointed right at her. She felt her womb spasm in anticipation even as a stab of fear quickened her heartbeat. She looked up into Trevor's equally bright, but more ultramarine blue eyes, noting that they were darker than Kate's and her own lighter blue eyes. They were still the most beautiful blue eyes she had ever seen, and she could feel her body respond to his gaze. It felt like her upper tailbones (her former thighs) bowed outward in an echo of spreading her legs, and her pelvic bones rocked forward, opening her vent towards the stiff monster that pointed directly at her womb.

"Ann," Trevor said softly, touching her lips, cheeks, and eyes with reverence. "Finally." He pulled her to him, and kissed her deeply again, stroking her hair and the top of her green tail, tickling her golden dorsal fringes.

Ann savored the feeling of closeness, Trevor's cock trapped between their bodies, Kate on her left, holding onto her left arm, and Rose on her right, stroking her elbow fin, which felt wonderful. Her tongue twisted into Trevor's mouth as she pressed her body and tail into his. She could feel her breasts swell, filling with milk that she knew that she would release for the first time with her first orgasm as a mermaid. The gentle pressure behind her enlarged nipples was deliciously agonizing as they pressed into Trevor's strong, hairless chest.

She broke off the kiss, and shyly reached down to his cock, and guided it to her throbbing entrance. His cock head felt cool against her hot skin, and she could feel her juices flow into the water around his cock. She twisted her tail around his and put both arms around his neck. She watched his face as she slowly pressed herself onto her long-time fantasy. His cock felt huge as it slowly stretched her open, and she worried briefly that she would not be able to accommodate him. He read her emotions, even though she wasn't using her CHEW, and took her face with both his hands.

(Don't worry,) he sent to her. (You'll be fine.)

(Trust me,) Rose added, her own eyes beginning to flutter as she watched her sister prepare to lose her virginity. (It will fit. Just press hard and get it over with.)

(My own brother,) Ann sent over her CHEW for the first time. (Who would have thought?)

(Sister,) Rose corrected. (Now and forever more.)

Ann smiled at her beautiful, dark haired sister wife, feeling the tension of only having the tip of Trevor's cock vibrating in her vagina. Rose was nearing orgasm, her eyes were half lidded, and her breasts were already leaking milk into the water, despite the fact that she and Kate had drained her dry a very short time ago. She returned her gaze to Trevor, and she pulled her lower lip into her teeth, and tightened her tail around his. Then, she gathered her courage and pressed forward with all her might, burying her face in his neck.

There was a slight hitch, and then he was all the way in. Ann froze, letting the brief sharp pain ebb from her body, feeling her hips pressed to his, her breasts against his chest, and her face nuzzling his shoulder and neck. As the pain quickly faded, it was replaced with a fullness that grew in pleasure until she could no longer keep her hips still. She lifted her head, and kissed Trevor fiercely and began to move her hips back and forth. She could feel each ripple of flesh within her as his thick cock stroked against the sides of her no-longervirginal vaginal canal. Her pleasure built quickly, and she could see thousands of tendrils of energy burst from her body, reaching into Kate, Rose, and Trevor. Kate's body was emanating new tendrils of green and gold too, and as Ann looked down to watch Trevor's cock disappear within her own flesh, she could see that all four of their tails were now filled with wild, chaotic lights and flickered and glowed across the surfaces of their tails, fins, and flukes.

Trevor reached down to her hips and began to help Ann with her strokes, and she could feel her insides start to tighten up, and the tickle of an enormous orgasm began to build in her belly. She felt her own flukes quiver uncontrollably, and she was barely conscious of how quickly the four of them were beginning to spin. All she could feel was Trevor's cock slamming back and forth and the intensity of her CHEW connections to Rose and Kate growing with her rising orgasm. She felt Kate's warm milk caress her right arm as her new sister wife approached her first mermaid orgasm, her moans of pleasure filling Ann's ears while her body bumped and nudged Ann's as she shook and twitched.

Kate tried to fight back her orgasm, wanting to time it with Ann's, but she was fighting a losing battle. Her breasts were already spraying milk into the water, and the feeling of her own milk rushing from her swollen nipples propelled her even closer to the looming precipice of a massive orgasm. It felt both like a relief and a release, her nipples tingling as though each stream of milk was caused by a tiny electric current. She looked across Trevor and Ann and watched as Rose fought back her own orgasm, her body swaying in time with the powerful thrusts Trevor was delivering to Ann. Kate tried to hold back, but Trevor's fin was buzzing at exactly the right frequency, and Kate felt her new, larger womb begin to spasm, each one building on the last, until her entire torso shook with each wave of pleasure. She didn't even know that she was screaming.

Ann could feel Kate lose herself in her orgasm, and felt a corresponding wave of pressure build in her own abdomen. Before she could savor her attempt to control her own body, Ann felt an enormous wave blossom within her that slammed through her with a force she never expected. Her entire body clamped down on Trevor's cock, and her tail tightened its grip on his. Her breasts spurting multiple streams of mermaid milk from her shaking breasts as she grunted and thrust herself against Trevor, her body convulsing with great waves of pleasure. Rose finally joined them, shaking and screaming as all three mermaids spouted milk into the water, obscuring them from the cameras that were still rolling. Just as Ann thought her body was returning to her own control, Trevor held her hips tight to his own, and pulsed his seed into her body, his long cock rippling with each spurt as it passed through him. Ann's womb responded to the hot splash of semen within her by squeezing down on his pulsing cock in a tremendous spasm that caused her to bite down on Trevor's shoulder as she rocketed into another, even longer orgasm, her cries joining those of her two sisters.

No one was still watching them, however. Not that Ann, Kate, Rose or Trevor cared one way or the other. But three pods were tangled together in the small pool in the lab, their new equipment left to record what ever data Trevor's pod was still generating on its own with no mer supervision.

To be continued.
