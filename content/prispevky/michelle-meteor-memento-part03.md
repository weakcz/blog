Amanda Steward was sure that she would never forget this day.  This morning, she had found out that her boyfriend had been cheating on  her for weeks; hours later, her best friend Michelle had shown her  something so unbelievable, the young woman could barely put it into  words. After drinking some strange liquid, Michelle’s plain body had  transformed into that of a super sexy goddess. 
<!--more-->

While originally on eye  level with Amanda, Michelle would now tower over her best friend by  about a foot. Now, the freshly transformed amazon considered gravity her  plaything as she hovered above the floor by about another foot. 

As intimidating as Michelle had become, the fact that they were  best friends seemed to remain as Michelle brought up the idea of  sharing those powers with Amanda. She had already demonstrated that she  could share specific powers through skin contact by making her  weightless for a short time. Of course this way of power sharing  couldn’t compete with drinking the same potion.

“So what do you say? Wanna try this stuff too?” Michelle finally asked the question.

Amanda gulped. Michelle had barely shown the extent of her  incredible powers, but the few things she had shown were far more she  had ever dared to dream of. Hell, the looks alone were enough to make  any woman jealous and intrigued at the same time. So why did she even  have to think about it? There had to be a catch.

“I … don’t think it’s a good idea,” she muttered. Amanda  avoided eye contact with her best friend for what felt like the  thousandth time today. This time, it was because she had no idea how  that golden-haired goddess would react, as well as her lack of a  suitable explanation to decline such an offer.

Michelle was surprised, but more of the fact that she wasn’t as  surprised as she had expected to be. Earlier, Amanda had struggled with  a question and Michelle had expected to be asked to share the potion  with her, when her best friend only wanted the permission to tough her  superhuman body. If she struggled with such a mundane request, it was  not too big of a stretch she had not thought about drinking the potion  too.  Because of that, Michelle was curious about her friends’ decision.

“You don’t need to drink it if you don’t want to. But I’d really like to know why you think it’s not a good idea.” 

The sound of Michelle’s voice was calm und comforting. This  allowed Amanda to look her friend in the eyes again, before sitting back  on the couch.

“I don’t really know myself. It feels so unreal. I mean, if I  hadn’t watched your transformation, I would never believe that you're  the same Michelle Jenkins I’ve known for years.”

“That’s just my appearance. I’m still the same inside.”

“You’re sure about that? What if that stuff affects your mind? I mean I can already see differences in your behavior now.”

“What?” Michelle asked, dumbfounded. “How do I act differently from before?”

Amanda sighed. “For starters, you used to be extremely  self-conscious about your body. Now you’re practically naked and seem  totally fine with it.”

Startled, Michelle tried to cover her breasts by crossing her  arms in front of them. Her success backfired though; as all she did was  showcasing how much bigger they were than before.

”Well, first of all, it wasn’t my plan to grow right out of my  pajamas! It just happened! So it’s obvious I didn’t want to repeat it.  In any case though, with a body like this, I don’t need to feel  self-conscious anyway!”

“Still, you looked like you’re enjoying it a little too much.  Now that I think about it, that transformation reminded me of a  striptease.”

“Ok, I admit it, I’m more confident now than I ever thought I’d  be. But even my ‘normal’ body looks better than before, it doesn’t mean  that the potion brainwashed me or something like that.”

“You’re right. Still, before I drink that stuff, I’d wanna make  sure there are no long-term side effects.”  As she spoke, Amanda  briefly thought about Fred and how she broke up with him this morning.  If she were to meet him while possessing the same powers Michelle now  had, things would get ugly. A shiver went down her spine. These powers  were not child’s play. Wasn’t there some kind of saying about power and  responsibility? No, that was from a superhero movie she’d seen.    Shaking her head from her stray thoughts, she looked up at Michelle.

Michelle just answered with an understanding nod. She wondered  whether her desire to share the potion with Amanda could actually be a  side effect of the potion itself. Amanda had made a good point here. 

“Say, Michelle. What are your plans for the future?”

“What exactly do you mean?”

“How do you plan to use your powers? Do you just want to have  fun or do want to use them for good…” Amanda’s face had turned bright  red as she realized how ridiculous this was “… like a superhero?”

“A superhero…” Michelle repeated. She remembered how she had  felt powerless as her colleagues were spreading more and more panic when  everyone feared the meteor might hit the city. Now with her powers she  felt quite certain she could protect the city from a meteor or anything  else that threatened it. 

“It sounds like a good idea, actually,” Michelle concluded. “But I don’t think it’ll be easy like in the movies.”

“Movies also have a villain that pops up shortly after the  hero, so that’s probably not a good example.” Amanda said as she smiled  from ear to ear. Somehow she was getting into all this superhero stuff.  “First things first, you need to get something to wear in public.”

“Actually I already bought something.”

“You already have a costume? What color?” Amanda said, getting more excited by the second.

“Costume? No, I just bought some casual clothes at the mall before. I don’t even know whether they fit or not.”

“Then why are you stand- I mean floating around here naked when you have new clothes to try on?” 



Most of the lab was already dark when James Thompson entered.  It was Saturday and most of his colleagues had the day off or finished  their work early. This worked in James’ favor, as he had no intention to  let anyone besides himself to perform DNA-tests on the only clue he had  on what happened in the mountains. The rags that most likely used to be  a woman’s pajama pants turned out to contain a usable sample of human  hair. James had worked with the police for three months now and knew how  much hair to expect in worn clothes. These pants on the other hand  exceeded his expectations. It contained so many hairs that he wondered  whether their original owner had shaved her legs and left the cut-off  hairs inside her PJs to throw him off-track. He chuckled upon this  stupid idea, and upon closer inspection he found something interesting.  Almost every hair he found still had its root attached to it. Maybe it  wasn’t shaved off, but actually fell out? James didn’t like the idea. If  he was really searching for some kind of mutation, chances were that  this mutation had also caused the hair to fall out in the first place,  making it highly unlikely that it contained any evidence of such a  mutation. James violently shook his head, to get himself back to topic.  It made no sense to concentrate on the super strength theory officer  what-was-his-name had told him, if he still had better things to try. 



“I can’t believe I’m going there again today.” Michelle said  while she and Amanda were on the way to the mall. It turned out Michelle  really had misjudged her new size, forcing her to wear the baggier of  the two outfits she had bought. Once Michelle had dressed herself,  Amanda had bombarded her with more questions about her powers, most of  which Michelle couldn’t even answer herself. The time she had spent in  her improved form yesterday wasn’t enough to let her discover everything  her new body was capable of. Both women were more than eager to find  out more about Michelle’s new abilities, but decided to wait until  sundown before actually testing it out. It would be best to fly out of  town for this. 

After they entered the mall, Michelle soon realized that  bystanders had started to ogle her. Even with her baggy T-shirt,  sweatpants and cheap flip-flops, people still stared at her like some  kind of movie star – all because of her unnatural beauty. This was  surely different than her last visit a few hours earlier. Instead of  standing in her way, people made way for both her and Amanda. Michelle  liked the attention she was getting, even though she was absolutely not  used to be watched this way. She felt a bit bad for her friend, who  didn’t attract as much attention due to being… well, normal. Then again  it had been Amanda’s own decision not to drink the potion and she didn’t  seem affected by it, so Michelle assumed it was fine.

The shopping tour itself went rather uneventful. In the end  Michelle was happy that clothes for her super self wouldn’t be an issue –  as long as she didn’t destroy them frequently – for the time being. She  secretly yearned for an opportunity to use her powers again, but the  shopping bags weren’t heavy enough for her to use her super strength.  The good news was that with her not using her powers, her supply of  super energy would last much longer than yesterday.

They spent the rest of the afternoon at Michelle’s place.  Amanda had decided to plan out as much as possible for Michelle’s  impending super hero career – much to the latter’s chagrin. Even though  she liked the idea of using her powers to help people, she didn’t see  any real need for a bright and shiny costume – especially since Amanda  suggested a combination of red and blue. Even Michelle knew that these  colors were present on most well-known superhero-costumes.

“If you’re so hell-bent on planning a costume already, I’d prefer black.” Michelle said, hoping this would speed up things. 

“What do you mean with ‘already’? If you’re going to become a  superhero you need a costume, and since we’ll have to make it ourselves,  we can’t start too early.” Amanda actually had a point here. “And why  do you prefer black?”

“I can only transform in my free time, meaning I’ll spend most  of my time patrolling at night. Black will provide a better cover at  night, making it easier for me to surprise any criminal I may be  hunting.”

Amanda was about to retort something but refrained from doing so. Michelle saw that her best friend had seen her point.

“I can see the stealth aspect, but that would only work with  some kind of full body costume. And to be honest, I think your costume  should be a bit more… revealing.”

“Revealing?” Michelle repeated, raising an eyebrow. “What’s next? High Heels? I can’t run in those.”

Amanda shook her head. “It’s more about your powers actually.  You said you’re bulletproof, but the costume won’t be. So I thought  something like a sleeveless leotard would be best, maybe a short skirt  but that should be it. You also should think about your ability to share  your powers with others. If you want to protect someone by making him  invulnerable you’ll need to establish skin contact to do so.”

Michelle couldn’t deny the logic behind it. If someone shot her  it would leave a hole in her costume, and she’d have to repair it. The  less the costume covered, the lower the chances of it being turned into  Swiss cheese.

“That means that a cape or high boots are just as useless right?”

Amanda nodded.

“Good, I didn't want a cape to begin with.”

Once it was dark outside, the two women prepared for a training  run. Michelle brought her backpack again, still filled with a change of  clothes. She also prepared three vials filled with the super potion.  Her transformation had lasted several hours now and she still felt fresh  and powerful, but once she started using her powers, her energy supply  would dwindle fast. The young amazon didn’t want to have to return home  just when the fun started. Michelle also silently hoped that Amanda  would change her mind and decide to drink the potion after seeing the  real effects. Soon later the two girls were flying – Michelle shared her  flight powers with Amanda – through the night sky.

“Michelle?” Amanda insecurely asked while the latter  transported them through the sky. 

“Could we stop at my place for a  second? It’s getting cold out here!” Amanda didn’t mention the dizziness  she felt. Her body wasn’t accustomed to the sensations of being  weightless the same way Michelle’s was.

Michelle changed course and a short while later they descended  in a back alley near Amanda’s place. The young superwoman waited outside  for her friend to grab some warmer clothes. She was surprised as she  had not only shared her flight powers but also her invulnerability with  her best friend. Whether Amanda had only thought that she was feeling  cold or whether the invulnerability didn’t change her conception of  temperature would remain a mystery for her. Michelle herself had  absolutely no problems with the cool night air. She was still dressed in  the same t-shirt and sweatpants she had worn during their shopping  trip. 

“My, my. What do we have here? One poor chick that can’t even afford shoes to protect her feet from this cold night.”

 

In fact the super powered woman was standing there barefoot  since she had dropped her flip-flops. This was mainly because they  wouldn’t survive her testing her abilities – not to mention impractical  for flying. The cold night air was just as unable to give her cold feet  as this creepy voice that had surprised Michelle for not even a second.  She turned around to face the source of these words.

The man who had snuck up from behind was a 6'7” giant which meant he towered over Michelle by 4 inches. 

“Maybe I can give you some warmth,” he said grinning. 

He was quite muscular, but a quick look into his ugly face was  enough to explain why this man was resorting to such desperation: he was  butt-ugly and the expression on his face showed that the ugliness was  not just limited to his appearance. 

Michelle couldn’t hide her own wicked smile. This man wanted to  rape her? Big mistake! The blonde amazon waited until her “attacker”  was close enough.

“What do you say? Wanna have some fun?”

“I’m gonna say no!” The super powered woman didn’t waste a  second before grabbing her would-be-rapist. As toned as they were, her  arms still looked far too slender to be able to lift the weight of  another human, not to mention a grown up man bigger than herself. The  man must’ve thought so as well and was obviously surprised when those  slender arms lifted him up before throwing him down the street.

His body landed with a loud and nasty sound fifty feet away  from Michelle. The man screamed in pain, causing Michelle to realize the  damage she had inflicted upon him. The blonde superwoman rose into the  air, hovering calmly towards her foe.

The man stared in horror as he realized that the woman he had  attempted to rape had not only broken several of his bones – his right  arm would be useless for some time – but was now flying towards him.

“No! Keep away!” 

He tried to hold up his left arm to protect himself from Michelle – most likely aware that this was just a useless gesture. 

 “If I ever see you approach a woman without the proper respect  for her,” Michelle said with a calm and intimidating voice. “Then I’ll  come at you and break every bone in your body.”

The man – stricken with fear – nodded slightly before he turned  around and ran as fast as he could. That was –given his condition – not  very fast, but eventually he turned around a corner and out of  Michelle’s eyes. 

Pleased with her performance, Michelle turned around to find  that Amanda stood behind her. The look on her friends’ face made it  clear that she had seen a good deal of what had happened here – she  stared at Michelle with an expression mixed of shock and awe.

“I don’t he’ll try to rape another woman for his entire life.” 

“H-he tried to r-rape you?” 

It seemed that Amanda had not seen this particular part, as she looked relieved upon hearing this. 

“And here I feared that you were bullying this guy just for the fun of it…”

Michelle was a bit surprised that her best friend believed she  could bully someone else, but then remembered Amanda’s reason for not  drinking the potion in the first place. Michelle considered this as  proof that she was still the same person from before and hoped Amanda  did so as well.

Ten minutes later, the two women landed on a nearby mountain.  Michelle had chosen a different place than the one she had used for her  first test run as she had spotted a bigger boulder here.

“I don’t know if I’ll grow accustomed to traveling this way,”  said Amanda as she was back on solid ground. She swayed while trying to  move forward, her dizziness becoming apparent.

“From my perspective, it’s the best way to travel”

“Maybe for you, but I get really dizzy from it. It seems like it’s a part of your powers that you can handle it so easily.”

“That would be one of many good changes. Speaking of which, I’ll show you some other ones.”

She walked over to the boulder and bent down. Getting a clear  grip was still the trickiest part here, especially since Michelle  already knew that she would be able to lift this boulder. She thought  about trying to “share her powers” with the stone boulder, but that  obviously only worked on living beings. Still, with a little – and  exaggerated – grunt she lifted the boulder into the air. 

Even the fact that Michelle had already told her about her  super strength and had even demonstrated it on a seat and a man wasn’t  able to lessen Amanda’s amazement upon seeing this display of incredible  strength. Her best friend was lifting a boulder that was bigger than  herself high over her head. Amanda saw how Michelle’s bare feet had sunk  a bit into the rocky ground. The weight of both boulder and woman was  too much for even this sturdy ground.

Seeing how her best friend's gaze had traveled to her feet,  Michelle thought it as the best moment to show that she could also fly  with this weight. She lifted off the ground for not even an inch before  letting the boulder crash down next to her. Yesterday she had already  discovered how much more energy she used with this weight, and she only  repeated this feat to see if she could. After all, the boulder was at  least thrice as heavy as the one she had lifted yesterday and she didn’t  know whether there was a limit to how much she could carry while  flying. 

Smiling, the young superwoman got another idea. She beckoned Amanda before explaining what she intended to do.

“Let’s check how much of my power I can share. Try to lift the boulder while I make you super strong.” 

Amanda didn’t like this idea as she hadn’t had as much fun by  sharing her best friend's powers as one would think. Then again, a  different power might not feel too uncomfortable. She had no idea that  super strength had been the very first power Michelle had shared with  her and that she hadn’t even felt it.

When Amanda bent over to grab the boulder in a similar way to  Michelle, the latter stood behind her and grabbed the back of her neck.  With Amanda’s extra layers of cloth, it was harder to find the necessary  skin contact for Michelle to share her powers with her. It didn’t  reduce Amanda’s nervousness that a hand strong enough to support this  gigantic boulder was now resting on her neck – still, she trusted her  friend enough to do as she asked.

Copying Michelle’s action from before Amanda put her hands on  the boulders sides and pushed as hard inwards as she tried to lift it  up. At first nothing happened. 

Michelle started to infuse Amanda with strength and  invulnerability. With her improved eyesight she could see how the energy  went straight to Amanda’s muscles that were straining with the enormous  weight of the boulder.

Like before, Amanda didn’t feel the energy that coursed through  her body. What she did feel was that the boulder moved slowly upward.  Still, all her muscles in her arm were hurting because of the strain  they were under. The boulder had risen two feet from the ground when  Amanda succumbed to the pain and let it fall back down. Even though she  had just lifted an enormous boulder, Amanda didn’t feel proud or  delighted. Michelle had been able to lift it with much more ease, so it  was clear that she wasn’t able to share all her strength with her. The  other point was that she herself had practically done nothing, having  used a power she herself neither possessed nor felt while her friend had  done the actual work. Then again this power sharing could have long  term effects on Amanda’s body as well, so she asked Michelle to refrain  from unnecessary power sharing for now.

Michelle was – of course – disappointed. It wasn’t because of  the limit of the super strength she could share with her friend but  because it became clear that Amanda didn’t enjoy the powers as much as  she had wanted her to. This way Michelle wouldn’t be able to convince  Amanda of drinking the potion too, something that bugged her more and  more even though she respected her friend's decision of waiting for some  long-term effects. 

The next demonstration from Michelle was rather unspectacular  from Amanda’s viewpoint. Michelle began running away and was out of  sight before she even had accelerated to superhuman speed. When she  returned, Amanda spotted her right before she stopped. Without using her  flight powers to stop herself, Michelle left a trail in the hard ground  with her bare feet. This on the other hand was impressive.

 

Michelle wondered about how she was supposed to find out what  else she could do. Some abilities had presented themselves directly,  while others needed to be tried out. She remembered how she had  subconsciously started to levitate somewhere during her initial  transformation. The freshly transformed superwoman had only realized  this particular part when she saw her mirror image floating above the  floor. Her improved eyesight had also required no testing and the  ability to sense and see the super energy didn’t either. Her super  strength on the other hand had to be tried out, as she had not felt  anything about it before. But the really weird case had been once Amanda  had touched Michelle’s arm. The superwoman had realized immediately  that she could do something new and that it required skin contact, but  she had to try it to see that she was able to share her powers with  others. 

Michelle tried to awaken other powers but with no success.  Either she had indeed no more powers than she already knew or she still  had to find the right situation for them. After about an hour of trying,  she gave up and began her return with Amanda. Not wanting to startle  her friend any more, Michelle carried Amanda the old-fashioned way. 

When they were already above the city, Michelle spotted something.

“Seems like I have something to do,” she said before starting to descend.

“What do you mean?”

“There’s a fire over there and from the looks of it, there’s still someone inside.”

Amanda didn’t ask any more. Michelle set her down on a nearby  building so she could watch at a safe distance and wouldn't be spotted  by any onlookers. When she saw Michelle land before the burning house  and run right into it, Amanda wondered if she’d be alright. Even though  she was certain of her friend's invulnerability, she also knew that  Michelle had no idea about what she was in for. There were people  standing in front of the burning building, most likely its inhabitants.  In the end, these people would decide whether Michelle’s first action as  a super heroine would be considered a success or not.

Once she entered the burning house, Michelle became aware of  two things. First, there was the fact that the infernal heat didn’t  trouble her in the slightest. In fact, it felt much more comfortable  than the ‘cold’ night air which wasn’t nearly as dangerous for an  unpowered human than this heat. The other thing she realized was that  the smoke here was her biggest trouble. The superwoman had little  trouble breathing through it, but it made it hard for her to see  anything. Even with her improved eyesight that could even see the super energy inside her body she couldn’t see any farther than a normal human  could in this situation. She was practically blind.

Through the roar of the fire, Michelle could hear a scream for  help. Unfortunately she couldn’t hear which direction it came from.  Michelle started to panic. If she couldn’t find the source of that  scream fast, someone would die. Suddenly Michelle felt how the super  energy concentrated in her eyes. The wall of smoke that blocked her  sight now became some kind of vague cloud that she could easily see  through. It didn’t stop at the smoke, either. Everything, be it smoke,  fire, furniture or walls, somehow became transparent to her. She was  still able to tell that it was there, but at the same time she also saw  what was behind it.

Reveling in this new kind of vision she possessed, Michelle  soon remembered what had prompted her to awaken this ability in the  first place. After a short search she had spotted a young girl who was  trapped by the flames two floors above her. Michelle started to run  through the flames and up the stairs. A wall of flame was blocking her  path but the superwoman didn’t even think about stopping or dodging and  jumped right through. Direct contact with the flames didn’t hurt her at  all but instead felt good. She wondered why it felt so good and noticed  far too late that her clothes had caught fire and were burning off her  body. Within seconds her body was completely covered in flames, but to  Michelle it felt like a rejuvenating massage. 

Arriving at the second floor, the young superwoman quickly  found the girl she had been searching for. That girl was no older than  five and was losing consciousness as Michelle approached her. Once she  reached the girl, Michelle lifted her up and immediately shared her  invulnerability with the young girl. With her new X-Ray vision Michelle  checked the building for any other survivors to find none – and  thankfully she found no corpses either. 

![](/obrazky/prispevky/michelles-meteor-memento/michelle_s_meteor_memento_03_01.png#center)

Knowing that her work was done  here, she jumped out of a nearby window while carrying the girl.

Michelle used her flight powers to land gracefully in front of  the burning building. In front of her was a group of naked onlookers –  wait, naked? Michelle realized that her X-Ray vision was still active  allowing her to see through the crowds clothes. She returned her vision  to normal – again she immediately knew how to use this power. Then she  realized that while the crowd that stared at her dumbfounded wasn’t  naked, she herself indeed was. There was no trace of her clothes left.

This wasn’t how Michelle wanted it to be! In her past, she had  more than one nightmare about standing in front of a group of people to  find out that she was naked. These nightmares had been a manifestation  of her stage fright whenever she had some kind of presentation to hold.  Every time Michelle would calm herself down telling herself to imagine  the audience being naked as well. Oh the irony! Now she WAS naked in  front of an audience and neither the fact that she could indeed see it  naked if she chose to nor the fact that she now sported the most  beautiful body on the planet comforted her in the least. The superwoman  recalled how she had had no qualms about practically stripping in front  of Amanda before transforming. She had barely paid attention about it  back then, but now she knew that this had been a sign of trust for her  best friend that shy Michelle put on a show like this. The crowd before  her was a whole different deal. Sure, Michelle was more confident with  her body like this and had already accepted the idea of wearing a  revealing costume that would show of her improved curves. But there was a  limit to that and this limit had been exceeded now. 

Right now the blazing flames in the building behind her acted  in her favor, since only her outline was visible for the people staring  at her. Michelle also held the unconscious girl so that she blocked the  sight to her breasts. Still, right now Michelle wished nothing more than  to wear something that covered her private parts. She felt a tingle go  over her skin, focusing on her breasts, back and her crotch. It was  pleasurable yet not arousing as the location of this feeling would have  suggested – Michelle was definitely not in the mood for that. She looked  to see what was happening and saw a strange black substance coming out  of her skin, covering her breasts and most likely parts of her back and  crotch as well. It resembled black latex that looked like a fabric  stretched over her body. 

“Oh my god,” she thought. “I’m growing myself a costume!”

In the frame of not even two seconds, Michelle’s body was now  covered in a black leotard – just like Amanda and she had planned. Oh  this was just great, she spent most of the day trying to find clothes  for her new form and now she learned she could just create some of her own? 

A woman came out of the crowd running towards the now-clothed superwoman. “Michelle!” she yelled. “Are you alright?”

The superwoman was startled, she didn’t know that woman and had  no idea how in the world why a stranger knew her name – especially  since she didn’t even look like her normal self right now. The answer  however came from the girl in her arms.

“Mommy?” the young girl asked as she regained consciousness and  turned towards the woman that now practically grabbed her out of  Michelle’s arms. 

Michelle had to smile. The very first person she saved in her  live happened to have the same name as her. If something like fate  existed this must’ve been its way to tell Michelle that she had taken  the right way. Some people started to clap and soon this had turned into  a full-fledged applause for the new heroine in town. Still, the icing  on the cake was seeing the overjoyed mother hugging her daughter and the  grateful look she gave the young superwoman.

“How could we ever thank you?”

Michelle wasn’t really prepared for some meaningful answer to  this question, still she was proud of what she came up with: “Live a  long and happy life together!”

With this, the young superwoman became airborne. The crowd answered with an awed “ooh” as they saw Michelle flying away.

Once she was certain that she was out of sight, she returned to  pick up Amanda who had watched the whole thing from where Michelle had  left her.  




<center>NO MATCH</center> 

The screen in front of James informed him about what he had  expected. He had compared the DNA to the entries in the criminal DNA  databases he had access to. Now there was only the meteor evacuation  Database. The latter had – unfortunately – been voluntary, so it only  contained the DNA of about 10% of the citizens. If the owner of this  hair was a hypochondriac, he had high chances of finding her. Otherwise  the meteor evacuation database had been ignored by the general public.  Even the TV-reporters who had been called to advertise this database had  refused to participate themselves and used their support staff for  filming purposes – and how high were the chances of the woman being one  of them? The only thing he had learned through the DNA analysis was that  he was indeed looking for a woman. As if the pink pajama pants and the  fact that the hair he found in it was so short it had obviously been  shaved frequently hadn’t been convincing enough. The fact that the hair  had seemingly fallen out on the other hand was just as much a mystery as  the things he had seen in the mountains. James leaned back in his  chair, as he let the computer search the meteor evacuation database.
