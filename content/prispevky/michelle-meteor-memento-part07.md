James got home and checked his calendar. Yes, today was Sunday. He didn't feel like he had just spent a day off, which was a stark contrast to how his work had been before this weekend. 
<!--more-->
All these false alarms that had made his job miserable were forgotten thanks to the recent events. First, the strange movement of a boulder had led him to meet a woman who fascinated him enough to ask her for a date. It had been a while since he had been on a date and even longer since he had felt so nervous asking. The case of a dead prostitute had turned quite bizarre because the woman in question was some kind of mutant. But all of this paled compared to security footage of a woman beating up some bank robbers and saving a hostage. This woman looked like she had jumped straight out of a comic book, flying and shrugging off bullets as if they were nothing - or pleasurable - if he interpreted the wicked smile on her face correctly. The following interrogation of the saved hostage was comparatively boring as both James and Detective Jacob Spencer has watched the security footage beforehand. She couldn't give any more information besides a short conversation she had with her savior and had preferred to flirt with both men instead - much to their chagrin. It hadn't taken long for James to mention his upcoming date so that she would focus her flirting on Jacob - much to her chagrin. It seemed like Jacob was accustomed to women trying to flirt with him during interrogation and he countered it by pointing out every remotely suspicious part of her behavior. In the end she had to explain why she had volunteered to be taken hostage in the first place. James hadn't even considered this suspicious, but rather brave of her. But as Jacob pointed out, an attractive woman in her late twenties was too ideal a hostage from the perspective of a bank robber, as she had much more to lose than an older person - which was why it seemed odd that she had volunteered. She did give a plausible reason, but it had a bitter aftertaste. He decided he'd go to bed early today, tomorrow would be an exciting day after all.

 

 

Michelle was also excited about the future, but unlike James she couldn't put it into words. She should have been scared, but all she felt was excitement. Her superhero career hadn't even started (at least that's how she saw it) but there were already some changes to the plan that didn't really sit well with her. Michelle had intended to keep as low a profile as possible when it came to being a hero, but her best friend Amanda had made it clear that she wouldn't be able to prevent her becoming public knowledge, and thus a celebrity. She didn't even consider her own shyness a problem since these powers gave her a lot of confidence. Her biggest concern was the media's hunt for sensation and tragedy. Michelle hadn't forgotten how they had added fuel to the fire during the meteor scare. If she became a public hero, she would be able to calm people down in a time of crisis.  But this required a certain reputation. As a superheroine she would have to give the impression of being an infallible saint, perfect in every way. This was the part that scared Michelle the most: the pressure of not being allowed to fail, of never being allowed to make a mistake, because if she did, the media would make sure it would never be forgotten. And while the additional pressure made her nervous, there was one thought that drove Michelle: her biggest critic wouldn't be the media, but herself. Failure would mean someone getting hurt or even dying, when she could have prevented it. She would be the last person to forgive herself if this happened. Of course, she wasn't naïve enough to believe she could save everyone and everything. Even with all her powers she still had limits, after all. In order to become an actual heroine, she needed to know these limits. 

A few hours ago Michelle had stopped a hostage situation and had learned the hard way that knowing her limits alone could be the difference between life and death. Super strength and invulnerability didn't mean that she could leave her guard down as a well-placed punch could stall her due to her normal weight. During her training session with Amanda earlier, Michelle had countered this problem by using her flight powers to simulate the needed mass. They hadn't been able to exercise this particular part for long, though since it required a great deal of super energy. It was strange, simply hovering at the same spot barely used any super energy, but the consumption increased exponentially the more force she put into her flight. Michelle didn't like this, not only because she found it odd that the consumption didn't seem to scale with her effort, but mainly because it made her super strength useless for all she cared. Sure, she had carried boulders that weighed several tons without a problem, knowing that she was far from using her maximum strength, but what good was this strength for being a hero? In fact, Michelle was happy that her control over her strength was good enough not to accidentally kill a normal human with a simple touch. When she thought about situations where her strength alone could be helpful, the first thing that came to mind was the meteor crash a few months ago. And this was just one of the situations where she needed her flight powers to even apply it. Michelle seriously doubted she could prevent a meteor crash without drinking enormous amounts of super potion beforehand. >

She couldn't accept that. Her flight powers were not only her absolute favorite but also the most versatile power she had. There had to be a way to reduce the energy consumption for flying when carrying something. Hovering cross-legged over her bed, Michelle tried to concentrate on how she flew in the first place. Today had been quite informative when it came to understanding her powers and she hoped to get a sudden flash of insight by meditating about it. Michelle felt how her body slowly changed the super energy from its raw form to the signature energy that kept her above her bed. It was interesting, but the only thing Michelle could say for sure was that there was no "flight organ". Every cell in her body was involved. After about an hour her powers faded, forcing her to come out of her meditation. As her body reverted back to its normal form, Michelle also felt her fatigue getting the better of her. After all, she had only slept for two hours last night. She didn't care whether or not her next round of sleep would be just as short, or that she would be naked on
top of her covers when her powers wore off. She simply fell asleep.

Once again she seemed to relive her day in her dreams. From the prevented rape and the bullet to her chest that felt so good it had almost ruined everything. The loneliness from watching couples returning home. James. Amanda, crying as she had injured her ex-boyfriend with her new super powers. The hostage that still looked eerily familiar, but Michelle was sure she had never met her. Amanda transforming. Two women playing tag in the skies. Amanda's eyes glowing orange, then unspeakable pleasure. Two women throwing rocks at each other. A copy of her super self hovering in front of her in an open white space. Wait a second.

 

 

"We meet again," the other Michelle spoke cheerfully.

This again? Michelle recalled her dream from last night, the same white space, the same copy of her super self. Still, something was different this time. 

"Yeah, um ... hi, I guess." Michelle was still caught off-guard. Despite all her fears earlier, she had dismissed their first encounter as a dream. Not anymore.

"Hello there," her doppelganger giggled. She really seemed to be happy. "So, what brings you here?"

"I've got no idea. I don't even know what or where 'here' is for that matter."

"It's where we meet," said the other matter-of-factly, still keeping her cheerful attitude.

"I figured as much. But that doesn't explain anything." 

"You're right, but I don't know any better than you do." For once her doppelganger sounded serious, but she still sported a dangerously charming smile.  

"Too sad. But who are 'you' anyway?" Michelle couldn't hide her curiosity any longer.

"Hmm, I can't explain that well. First I thought, I was part of you, but now I know I'm not. You and I are separate beings."

"Like a split-personality?" Michelle voiced her fears.

"No," the other shook her head. "A split-personality would be still part of you, right?"  

"That's right," Michelle said, relieved. Her other self emanated an innocence that made it hard for her to doubt her. "You're a lot more cheerful than last time."  

"Of course I am. You're here, helping me again, but this time I can help you as well."  

"You say I help you, but I don't see how I do that."  

"That's because you don't value your own deeds the way I do. Just now you showed me your day, the events that happened since we last met, the feelings you had when you lived them."  

"Wait, you saw the dream I had just now?"  

"Yes, I don't really know how or why you showed it to me, but I'm grateful that you did. Through this I learned a lot about you, like how I can help you."  

Michelle was confused to say the least. During their first encounter, her doppelganger had bombarded her with questions, and clearly this curiosity hadn't faded.  

"And how exactly do you intend to do that?"    

"I know a few things that you don't and that could help you."   

"I figured as much," Michelle was still surprised about the change of attitude in her other self. "The last suggestion you made to me was rather cruel, you know."

"Yes, you clearly made your point regarding that. And you've proven that your way of doing things has a lot of potential."  

"My way of doing things? What exactly are you talking about. I don't recall meeting this would-be-rapist again today."

"I'm not talking about this scum alone. You have the tendency to see value in things that I would consider worthless. For example this..."

Michelle watched as her other self became covered in a black cat-suit. Even though it covered more than Michelle's own leotard had, it left little to the imagination.

"Originally this was a means of protection," her other self continued. "To me this ability was useless the moment invulnerability was involved - I mean what better protection do you need when you can't even be hurt. But you found a way to make this ability useful again - even though I don't really get this shame you feel about being naked. Not only that, you even added a new possibility in using it to protect someone else - by combining it with the same invulnerability that made it outdated in the first place. It's this quick adaptability that makes you outstanding."

"It wasn't that big a deal," Michelle felt herself blush. She was getting praised too much lately. 

"Maybe to you it wasn't. But its only normal for us to perceive things differently here. To me these powers aren't as exciting as they are to you, for example."

"You know them better than I do, right?"

"I don't know if better is the correct term. Your knowledge had grown before you shared it with me, so it's more like I have different knowledge than you. You see, the powers only had one simple purpose: survival. Hovering above the ground makes it harder to get eaten, then there was this protective layer," she gestured at the cat-suit she had created earlier. "And of course invulnerability as the ultimate protection."

"How about the super senses, like X-Ray vision?"

"Those are just enhancements of your own abilities."

"This also explains the super strength. What about heat vision?"

"That's a new one to me as well."

 

 

Michelle opened her eyes, once again her conversation with her other self had ended abruptly and her sleep along with it. She felt cold; not a big surprise considering she lay naked on her bed instead of under the blanket. Interestingly the cold didn't seem to affect her as much as she would have expected. Michelle was positive that she wouldn't catch a cold this way. She was pretty sure that her super form could deal with any temperature, no matter how cold it was - at the expense of super energy, of course. Her mortal form was a different story, and snuggled under the covers. Now that she thought about it, even her super form preferred warmth. It had felt great to have her clothes burn off her body in the burning house and being hit by Amanda's heat vision had been downright orgasmic. As she recalled the unexpected side-effect of her best friends newest superpower, Michelle noticed just how clear and detailed her memory of this moment was. Her whole neural system had been on overdrive back then, causing her to experience everything in slow-motion, but also making her much more sensitive.  Just to make sure, Michelle recalled the first time she had used this ability and could clearly remember every detail of Amanda's transformation earlier. Indeed, using her full super senses gave the term eidetic memory a whole new meaning. 

Looking at her clock, Michelle noticed that it was barely midnight. She smiled. Her reduced need for sleep wasn't a one-time thing after all. This was one of the bigger improvements to her normal form as it allowed her much more free time and it would come in really handy for her plans to become a superhero. "No use in staying in bed", Michelle thought, as she stood up and walked into her kitchen. As she took out the bottle of super potion in her fridge, she wondered whether she should spend the night on patrol or getting to know her powers even further...

 

 

"Finally, work begins." Amanda couldn't believe that she felt this way on a Monday at 5 am. She wasn't much of a morning person and naturally hated the morning shift. Today she was happy to work this shift for two reasons: First, this meant she'd be done with work sooner and she could go over to the hospital to visit Fred. The other reason was that she had only slept for a few hours and experienced firsthand why Michelle had gone on patrol the night before - she just couldn't sleep anymore. With all the boredom piling up, Amanda had been tempted to drink the dose of super potion she had in her possession. She was sure that had she had more than one potion available, she would have transformed again - if only out of boredom. For the future, she needed to find a hobby to fill her nights.

Now that she was at work, her desire to transform was absolutely zero. This was partially caused by her being distracted, but most came from the improvements her earlier transformation had left on her body. Being a waitress, her improved looks directly translated to the tips she received, and the fact that work just seemed to be easier altogether meant that she could do it with an even friendlier attitude than normal. As much as she regretted the outcome of her first transformation, she couldn't deny that it worked wonders on her income. Time flew by this morning and Amanda was grateful that her coworkers didn't press her on her new look - especially her new hair color. It was good that she didn't have to lie too much - at least until a familiar face entered the restaurant.

At first glance Erika seemed to be the perfect career woman. Her business attire combined with her confident attitude gave the impression that this woman was married to her job. But Amanda knew better. She knew that Erika wasn't as high on the career ladder as her clothes suggested; she even seemed to lack the ambition to achieve a higher position at the bank she worked for. Amanda couldn't understand this lack of ambition - she herself didn't like her occupation mainly because her original goals had been much higher. Then again Amanda was even more at odds with Erika's private life, as the other woman was rather wild when it came to that. To Erika the terms “boyfriend” or “relationship” didn't seem to exist as she switched her lovers along with her underwear. Despite their different views, Amanda got along quite well with Erika, mostly because of the latter’s friendly and surprisingly loyal nature. 

"You look good today," Erika sounded a bit surprised as she said that.

"Same to you," Amanda answered, even though she noticed the tired look in the other woman's eyes. She knew Erika had to work on Sunday and thus hadn't had much time to relax.

"I heard you were sick, but it seems my brother exaggerated somewhat if you're already working again." 

Amanda didn't need to ask why Erika knew that. It was only natural for Fred to call her and tell her about his hospitalization. He must've mentioned Amanda's condition back then, even though it was outdated by then.

"Oh he wasn't exaggerating. I'm just lucky that I recovered quickly."

"That's good to hear. So you're going to the hospital once you're done here?" 

"No, why should I?" lied Amanda. Fred hadn't told her that he was hospitalized, so she needed to act the part.

"Because your boyfriend is there, perhaps?" Erika sounded almost threatening. Even though she didn't really pursue a relationship for herself, Erika did know what it meant to be in one. Amanda didn't blame her for being protective of her family.

"He's in hospital?" Amanda feigned surprise. After all she was surprised, but more about Erika ignoring the fact that Amanda and Fred had broken up. "What happened?"

"You didn't know?" Erika was too surprised to determine whether or not Amanda's act was convincing. "His knee is ruined, nothing serious, but he doesn't say a word about what happened. I thought that he'd be a bit more open to you as his girlfriend."

“Sorry to disappoint you here, but your brother wasn’t that honest with me either. He’ll have a lot of explaining to do if he wants to get back together with me.”

Erika’s eyes widened in shock as she heard that.

“You… broke up?” Erika eventually muttered. “How? Why?”

“About the how: he cheated on me. As for the why: I’ve got no idea! But he better have a good explanation. Not mentioning being in the hospital doesn’t help.” The fact that she was responsible for his condition on the other hand did.

“Sounds like a lost cause to me,” Erika thought out loud. She clearly didn’t take this news well, and Amanda was once again surprised how supportive Erika was about their relationship. Too bad she couldn’t hint that Fred had an actual chance to salvage their relationship without making herself suspicious.

Their conversation didn’t last much longer, mostly because Amanda had to serve other customers while Erika was eating her breakfast. Still, Amanda made sure to get Fred’s room number so that she could pop by unannounced. 

 

 

"… and this is all we know so far," James concluded his report. It hadn't even taken him fifteen minutes to fill his superior - Professor John Smith - in on the news of this weekend - including the security video that showed the superpowered blonde goddess beating up some bank robbers. Needless to say they were amazed by the presented footage. 

"Are there any connections between Jane Doe and …" he gestured at the screen that had just showed the security footage "...her?"

Jane Doe - the alias made it clear that the prostitute's real name wasn't much of an issue here. James himself had deliberately not memorized it, either. He preferred to differentiate between the woman that had lived a miserable life that ended in tragedy and the scientifically valuable corpse she left behind.

"She described one of her drug trips like 'being able to fly' but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. As long as the autopsy doesn't hint otherwise, I think it's better not to consider them related."

Professor Smith nodded affirmatively. "About the autopsy, I'm going to have Professor Harland do it. He's the best when it comes to genetic diseases and he can start quickly."

"What about me?" James could barely hide his disappointment. He had been afraid that something like this was going to happen, but he had no valid argument against it. Harland was the big fish here, it was only logical to let him handle the mutated 'Jane Doe', no matter how much James would have preferred to do so himself. Mentioning his personal dislike of Harland's practices would only make him seem petty.

"You continue as before. Everything out of the ordinary could be a clue for either this superpowered woman, Jane Doe or both. Harland will fill you in on what he finds as well. Make sure the police knows what to search for."

"Right now they're keeping their eyes open for this blonde woman. She has been said to have prevented two muggings last night, if the witnesses are to be believed. They're trying to keep the media out of the picture and urge us to do the same."

"That's a given, but it depends on how low a profile Blondie wants to keep. If she wants to become famous all she has to is step in front of a camera after all. Let's hope we have some explanation to calm the public down once she becomes public knowledge. If we leave the explaining to the media, things are going to end badly. We don't need another meteor scare."

"Speaking of which, was there anything about the meteor that could be connected to these two women?" James asked.

"Maybe. I'll get you an updated memo about what the department discovered."

In the end, James could be happy with the outcome of this discussion. He may have lost his access to 'Jane Doe' but in return he would get some input on the meteor. And hunting every mystery made a lot more sense now that he knew there was something out there worth finding.

 

 

The day went quickly for Michelle. Her colleagues seemed to notice her improved looks even if they didn't realize that she had changed. She was also anxious that someone would know about her super form or discuss her actions, but none of that happened either. She liked how everything was pretty normal, yet still better than Friday or the weeks before. More than before, Michelle felt that the improvements to her body weren't merely cosmetic in nature. Everything seemed easier now. Even her motivational problems were history.

Michelle didn’t attribute the last part to the changes her body had gone through over the last few days, though. Sure, the fact that work was easier was motivating, but it was still the same work that had gotten her down over the past weeks. Nothing had changed on that front. The true difference was that today, Michelle had something to look forward to. And it was ’t the possibility of drinking the super potion and the powers that came from it, either. She was anticipating something much more mundane, even though to her it was even more special than flying through the clouds was: a date. Saturday night, when she had been patrolling the city for the first time, she had envied the couples that were walking home together at that point. Michelle didn't miss the irony in that. In fact, she welcomed it. After all, the goal of finding love had been one of the few things that hadn't changed through getting these powers.

 

 

Amanda approached the hospital with a quick pace. Once her shift was over, she had practically run back to her apartment, changed out of her work clothes into something more appropriate. She hadn't dressed up too much: a green blouse, tight jeans and a pair of heels to make her appear taller. After all she was a proud woman worthy of being fought for, not a dumb girl that would fight for a lost cause. Now she walked through the halls of the hospital as if she owned the place. Amanda tried to ignore the fact that this was the place she had dreamed of working at long ago. This had been easier yesterday when she had entered Fred's room through the open window. Since she couldn't fly to the second floor this time, she had to take the stairs and finally the door. She knocked and entered to find a surprise. 

Fred wasn't alone in his room, another man was standing in front of his bed. Amanda didn't know this guy, so it was unlikely that he was one of Fred's buddies. He was about the same age as them, tall and - Amanda had to admit - handsome.

"A-Amanda," as expected Fred was totally surprised. "What are you doing here?"

"That's my line. Erika told me that you're here, but she had no idea why you're here."

"Welcome to the club," the other man interrupted.  He put an end to her speculations by introducing himself. "Hi, my name's James Thompson. I was just talking to Mr. Ryley about how he ended up here, as well. He claims to be run over by his own car, but I'm not convinced this is everything."

"Amanda Steward, nice to meet you."

So this was Michelle's date? Amanda couldn't deny her best friend's taste, but his presence here was a bit problematic.

"So Mr. Ryley, would you like to tell us the whole story? I've seen photos of your car and looks like someone had his way on it with a sledgehammer, not like it hit a human body."

"You underestimate the damage, a human body can cause on a car," came Fred's answer.

Amanda almost started to laugh as she heard that. The truth was that she had kicked the car into the miserable state it was in now. In fact she hadn't even worn shoes as she had done that, so technically Fred wasn't even lying. 

"Yeah, the human body really is full of surprises sometimes, but your injuries don't match up with the accident you're describing. And even if you were hit by your own car as you describe, who drove it? Why did a woman call the ambulance but didn't wait until it arrived?"

"Why do you care? The whole thing was embarrassing enough, so why are you even more pressing than the cops about this?" Fred actually had a point. 

"Because you're obviously hiding something," Amanda interrupted. She had come here with the intention of making Fred tell whatever he was hiding from her and she was going to see it through. It would only be suspicious if she suddenly supported him now. Now that she had a few seconds to think over it, if James was with the police, he may already know about Michelle’s actions. She might as well check out how much he knew.

James looked at her puzzled. Of course he hadn't expected her to side with him, but since he didn't know their history he quickly accepted her support. Then he answered Fred's original question.

"The police and I have a different viewpoint when it comes to this situation. They only wanted to know whether or not they had to investigate a hit and run. But as long as you claim there was no crime involved - and you seem to have been quite convincing - their job is done. As for me, I'm not looking for crimes but for scientifically relevant occurrences. The police tipped me of because they think your incident may be such a case."

Amanda watched Fred's expression intently. Despite his attempts to hide this fact, Amanda noticed her ex-boyfriend's irritation that she had sided with a total stranger against him. And since he clearly knew that she had every reason to be pissed at him, his irritation could only have one - much less rational - reason. 

"How exactly can this accident be scientifically relevant?" Amanda decided to make sure she played her role as the one who knew nothing about Fred's incident. "Even if it was a hit and run, that doesn't sound too interesting."

"Yes, a strange hit and run wouldn't be that important, but I can connect Mr. Ryley to something that is scientifically relevant."

"What?" Both Amanda and Fred shouted in unison. Amanda was a bit relieved to see that Fred shared her surprise. Whatever he was hiding from her was rather normal after all.

"I don't really understand this. What kind of occurrence can you connect me to?" Fred asked. 

"Yesterday, there was a bank robbery," James began, only to be cut short by Fred.

"You're hassling me just because my sister was the hostage in a bank robbery?"

Amanda didn't like the sound of this. Had Erika been the hostage that Michelle had saved yesterday?

"Did your sister tell you the whole story?" The tone of James voice made it clear he assumed otherwise. To Amanda this just confirmed that James knew about Michelle's actions.

"No, she was a bit pissed when I didn't tell her how 'this' happened." Fred pointed at his knee.

James chuckled. "I won't berate you on your communication issues, but you really missed an interesting story." He then turned to Amanda. "You said you talked to her earlier. Did she mention anything?"

Amanda shook her head. "No, she didn't even mention that there was a bank robbery in the first place. What happened?"

"Something that you wouldn't believe if I told you. But since your boyfriend doesn't want to tell me how he broke his knee..." 

"Ok, I get it!" Fred blurted out. "I'll tell you what happened if you tell me how that relates to my sister..."

Fred then went on and told him about his encounter with "Devil". He actually kept the description of Amanda's alter ego to a minimum, describing her only as a stunningly beautiful woman dressed only in a blue leotard. Amanda suspected that this description would be much more detailed if she weren't there. Now he even missed out her hair color - the main difference between her and Michelle in their super forms. James didn't seem to notice this fact. Other than that, Fred stayed true to the facts. Normally this would have been good news to Amanda. Any more lies would have made it much harder to even consider trusting her ex again. Unfortunately for her, the truth hurt. While it was heartwarming to hear that "at that moment, Fred simply wasn't in the mood to flirt, not even with the most beautiful woman on earth", everything that followed was pure torture. Amanda had went over the whole situation many times in her head before, always coming to the conclusion that meeting Fred had already been the worst mistake back then. All the confidence about her new powers couldn't outweigh the anger she felt at him, thus causing her to lose her temper and ultimately hurting him. The problem was, that Fred didn't possess this piece of information. Due to this, Fred's version of her sounded more like a spoiled brat than a grown woman. And he didn't even do it on purpose.

"She just started to trash your car? Just like that?" James sounded quite shocked. 

"Well I wasn't really polite either," Fred answered.

"That doesn't justify her actions. She stands on your car and talks about messing with you, who would stay polite after that?" James turned to Amanda "Don't you agree?"

Amanda could only nod in reply. The question had taken her off-guard, but luckily she didn't need to speak or lie for this answer.

"See? So how did she break your knee?"

"It was an accident, actually. She grabbed me by my shirt and flew up a bit. Then my shirt ripped, I fell and my knee didn't like the landing."

"Why do I doubt that it was an accident," James thought aloud. Amanda didn't know what hurt more, the fact that this guy already hated her alter ego or the fact that she couldn't blame him.

"Believe what you want, it was an accident!" Fred surprisingly defended Amanda's alter ego. "She didn't fake the concern when I fell, and she called the ambulance. If you ask me, she's just inexperienced with these powers."

Amanda hadn't expected this kind of support from the person who had every reason to hate her. She barely hid a smile even though she knew that her current role actually required her to act jealous of herself. Thankfully neither of the men noticed.

"Anyway," Fred continued. "Now that you know how I got injured, how about you tell me what's that got to do with my sister?"

"This woman has appeared a few times over the last few days, saving people from fire, rapists or in case of your sister: bank robbers." James sounded a bit disappointed as he said that. He took out his phone and began typing, eventually handing it over to Fred - who beckoned Amanda over to watch the screen together with him.

It was a video that showed the hostage situation Michelle had dealt with yesterday. It played out just as her best friend had described it, making it even harder for Amanda to act surprised. The only surprise for her was that Erika was indeed the hostage there. It was a total coincidence, but this was the reason James was here, after all. Amanda suddenly noticed Fred grabbing her hand. She looked at him only to see that he intently watched the events unfold. He hadn’t even noticed that he had grabbed Amanda’s hand and held it tight. When Erika was threatened at gunpoint, Amanda could feel him trembling on the inside. Seeing someone close to him in a life-threatening situation made him reach for any emotional crutch he could find. Amanda thought it would be tactless to mention now that Fred had lost his holding-hands-privileges during the breakup. In fact, she had her own problems watching the scenes and she had to constantly remind herself that Erika would survive the whole ordeal. When the bank robber finally dropped his gun, both Fred and Amanda let out a small sigh of relief.

Now Fred realized that he was gripping Amanda's hand and let go with an expression that was somewhere between embarrassment and thankfulness. He started the video again, this time without the tension. Then he paused it so that the freeze frame showed a decent view on Michelle's head and face. The video quality was awful, though. 

"It's not her," Fred finally exclaimed.

"What do you mean? That was totally Erika!" Amanda said this in a semi-serious tone. She already knew that Fred was about to clear a different misunderstanding. 

"The other woman, it's not the one I encountered."

"How so?" James asked.

"The one I met was a redhead, this one seems to be blonde. It's be hard to recognize on this black and white video, but it seems like they also have different eye colors."

"According to your sister she had quite remarkable blue eyes. And yes, she's blonde."

"Then we're talking about two different women. The other one has orange eyes. She really looked like her eyes were on fire."

"Two women with superpowers, huh?" James let this revelation sink in. 

Of course he was surprised, but Amanda noticed that he also seemed relieved to hear that. This was strange. Amanda had theorized about there being more than just the one plant that gave Michelle and herself superpowers and the possibility wasn't that encouraging.

"You seem happy to hear that," Fred had noticed it too.

"I know, the fact that there's more than one woman with superpowers should be quite scary, but try to see it this way: This blonde woman has shown up several times to help people - like a superhero so to speak. Would you prefer this woman to go around bullying people or would you rather have the bully being a totally different person? This way, Blondie could always step in if the redhead decided to cause real trouble." 

"Aren't you judging her too hard? So far it was just an accident, and she might become a superhero of her own." 

James nodded, "That might be even better, though the only way to find out for sure is to wait and see." Taking his phone back, he turned towards the door. "Needless to say that, but I'd really prefer you not to run to the next reporter talking about this. The media can turn this whole situation into a big mess if given the chance." With this he left.

 

 

Now that they were alone, an awkward silence followed. During James' presence they had acted as if everything was fine between them, but now it seemed like neither of them knew how to continue from here. It wasn't at all like Amanda expected it to be. Now that she officially knew about Fred's encounter with her alter ego, Amanda would have to pretend to be jealous - of herself. Not to mention the reason they had broken up in the first place: his cheating on her.

"Thank you," Fred eventually said.

"For what?"

"For coming here. It was more than I could ask for."

"You may be right about that. But since Erika didn't know how you got injured, I feared it had anything to do with our breakup." The lies she had prepared beforehand came in handy after all. "Doesn't seem this way, though."

"Yeah, this woman came out of nowhere."

"Really? From how you defended her, it sounded like you were quite fond of her." Amanda almost asked whether she was the one with whom he had betrayed her, but decided against it.

"I won't deny that, after all she's the reason I wanted to talk to you in the first place." Fred was sounding more and more embarrassed as he said that.

"How is that?" For once, Amanda had absolutely no idea what he was getting to, and she feared that maybe he had figured out that she was 'Devil'.

"After the accident, she came visiting me here and apologized about the whole thing. She was really eager about that and I figured that I should follow her example." Fred took a deep breath. "It was wrong of me to see another woman behind your back. I betrayed your trust and for that I'm sorry. And if there's one thing I regret about the whole thing then it's the fact that I hurt your feelings. You were the one good thing in my life and I'll never forgive myself for hurting you."

Once again Amanda was amazed at how she instinctively knew that Fred was telling the truth here. As cliché as his words sounded, they were his true feelings. Yesterday it had been the same, but she had been in her super form back then. She had wondered if this was just another part of her powers, but right now she was normal. Without her powers, this instinctive trust was rather disturbing. Was she just fooling herself?

"Why now?" Amanda began. "You had your chances to apologize before; I downright asked you if you had anything left to say yesterday. And you declined. So don't tell me that someone else actually needed to show you how to apologize." Amanda was getting louder and louder. "Can you imagine how things look from my perspective? I tell you how it looked: It looked like you didn't care about our relationship at all, like nothing had any worth for you. I was just another stupid girl that fell for your lies. It's really hard for me to believe that you regret anything." Or at least it should be.

Fred didn't look into her eyes. Like a scolded boy he sat there and waited for Amanda to finish. He also waited a few seconds before he began his answer - seconds that seemed like eternity for Amanda.

"Just because I didn't show any regret, it doesn't mean that I didn't have any. But I admit that I wasn't aware just how much all this meant to me. I knew my chances of patching things up were slim - and I suppose they still are. You're not the kind of woman that would simply forgive this whole affair. I wouldn't love you if you did. That's why I thought the best course of action would be a clean cut - the sooner we broke up, the sooner we would get over it and could continue with our lives."

"So in other words, you gave up before the fight began? I thought you were more of an optimist. What about your affair herself? Where did she fit into your plan?"

Fred sighed, naturally this was not his favorite topic. "Honestly I didn't have one, as I had no particular feelings for her."

"No particular feelings?" Amanda almost shouted. "Then why did you have this affair in the first place?"

"Because she had … connections. There's more than one reason for me not to be proud of this, but the truth is that I used her. I wanted to get something and this affair was the best - well, actually the only - way to get it."

Amanda didn't believe what she heard. "Let me ignore how cliché this sounded, what exactly did you want to achieve through her?"

"Since it was me who betrayed your trust, I can't allow myself to lie to you if I want us to get back together. But this is something I don't want you to know. This is too private."

"Did I hear this right? You want to make up with me but you want to hide the very reason you cheated on me? How much more selfish can you get? I mean how am I supposed to trust you at all?"

"I already told you why I cheated on you! All I left out is one detail that I consider too personal for this. Do you really think this detail could make the circumstances any worse?"

There was something in Fred's voice that disheartened Amanda. He was losing hope about getting back together. After all she hadn't given him any hint that this might work. Perhaps letting him hold her hands and being here in the first place were too subtle for him to notice, not to mention that he didn't have any clue that she felt guilty for his knee.

"I suppose not," Amanda said, calming herself down. "But it's a bit hard to imagine a relationship together if you're going to keep secrets from me."

"I prefer the term privacy; after all I don't know every tiny detail about you either. Some things need time to build up the necessary trust and this is one of them."

"Could you at least tell me that it's not something illegal?"

"I'm a jerk, not a criminal." Fred forced himself to chuckle, only to contort his face in pain - his knee didn't like to be moved yet. He then asked the question that tortured them both for the last day. "Do you believe there's a future for us?"

"I doubt things will become exactly the same as before. But I also can't deny the fact that I want things to work out between us as well." Fred's face clearly lightened up upon hearing this. "Don't get me wrong, this isn't a free pass for you. We'll take things slowly and you will have some concessions to make of your own."

"Like what?"

"For example I'm going to need my share of privacy as well..."

 

 

The closer evening came, the more Michelle's anticipation was replaced by panic. It began with her eating an early dinner only to remember that her date included dinner in the first place. For a second she wondered if this was some kind of withdrawal symptom as she hadn't been normal for such a long time since her first transformation. But that wasn't the case. Sure the idea of drinking the potion and transforming into her superpowered alter ego was as tempting as always, but it wasn’t like she really needed it.  No, she had been eating because she was nervous ... and hungry, but that was to be expected. Now she was standing in the shower, trying to get her nervousness under control by thinking about the irony of the situation. Two days ago she had been sure that her next date would be in her super form with her super powers as the ultimate confidence boost. It turned out she could score herself a date just fine even without them. Well… almost. The tiny improvements to her body had helped as well and while she still had no idea how deep these improvements went, she already added heightened sensitivity to the list – the hot water on her skin really felt good. Her super self on the other hand was turned on by the other sex in unexpected ways: by their fists and bullets from their guns. The latter with unexpectedly erotic results. There had been only one instance that could be considered flirting and that was a teenage boy she had saved from a mugging last night. The boy had blatantly asked if he had died and gone to heaven – given the fact that he had been threatened at gunpoint before Michelle’s intervention, he might have believed what he said. Why was such a kid even out at night?

Stepping out of the shower she took a look at the time and learned that she had been showering for almost forty-five minutes. Great, now she had only fifteen more minutes left until James would arrive. In a hurry she began to dry herself. Good thing she had already planned out her outfit for the night: a beautiful red dress that hadn’t fit too well earlier as well as matching red heels. The dress had been a birthday present from Amanda, so instead of changing it, Michelle had intended to lose the few pounds that would make the dress a perfect fit – and she had lost those pounds after transforming back to normal. The shoes were a present from her sister for the same birthday – since she lived in another town, she clearly had cooperated with Amanda. Normally Michelle wasn't the type to wear heels, but today was a special occasion. With the time running short, she didn't have any time to stand around worrying. Ten minutes later she was finished and gave her mirror image a final check. God she looked great. She filled out the dress as if it had been bought specifically for this evening.  Her face looked absolutely gorgeous even though she wasn't even wearing any make-up. Only one thing seemed off, but Michelle couldn't figure it out. Since she managed to be ready before her date arrived, she took a final look at her bedroom to check if there was some evidence she needed to hide. The plant was still hidden in plain sight on her nightstand, since it would only be suspicious to conceal something like this. She spotted her over-sized flip-flops on the floor and proceeded to hide them in her closet along with the other clothes she had bought for her super self. Michelle had long since taken care of any trace of the potion in her room. Her supply was hidden in the fridge and she checked once more for any glass or vial she had used to transform - only to confirm that she had indeed washed all of them. Then she noticed her glasses that laid unused on her nightstand.

"Oh my god," Michelle whispered to herself. She hadn't even noticed that she had forgotten to put on her glasses because she had no trouble seeing. With shaking hands she tried to put them on. As her vision got blurry she immediately took them back off. It was official: she wasn't near-sighted anymore. As great as that was, why did it have to happen now, right before a *ding dong* date? No use in fretting over it now. As she headed to the door, she took one last glance at the mirror. Brown. At least the color of her eyes was still as it should be. As she walked to the door she felt herself getting nervous again and she calmed herself down that being in better condition than expected couldn't be a bad thing. Once she had opened the door, her nervousness had all but disappeared. James had taken things just as seriously as she, and Michelle had to admit that he looked great in a suit. He really looked like a guy that could walk into a bar and leave it with a woman in each arm - if it weren't for the dumbfounded look on his face that made it really obvious that he liked what he saw. Who needed superpowers as a confidence boost if she could render a handsome guy like him speechless?

"Wow … uhm, I mean hi." James' face turned bright red as he struggled for words. He cleared his throat before finally making any decent sense. "Sorry about that, I was just astounded by how great you look."

"Thank you. You look nice as well," Michelle said with the most charming smile. She wasn't nervous anymore. This was going to be fun.

 

 

Amanda looked around the bar Erika had dragged her to. It was still early in the evening, so there weren't many customers besides them. Erika had arrived at Fred's hospital room shortly after he and Amanda had agreed to give their relationship another chance. She quickly accepted this turn of events, but she seemed a bit wary about it as well. Things turned a bit awkward when Fred and Erika exchanged their stories about their encounter with Super Amanda and Super Michelle. Like James before, Erika didn't really have a high opinion about Super Amanda. She became understandably irritated that her brother seemed to defend the woman who was responsible for his condition. Especially in front of his girlfriend. Fred used this opportunity to explain how this incident had given him a second chance with Amanda, causing the latter to exclaim that she was right there. Thankfully the discussion then shifted more towards Erika's role as a hostage and Michelle's intervention about it. When Amanda excused herself to leave, Erika had surprisingly accompanied her 'to have a chat'. 

Now they were sitting in a booth at a bar waiting for their drinks. Amanda wondered about Erika's motivation - fearing that the other woman had drawn the painfully obvious conclusion that the "evil redhead" had acted far too much like a pissed ex-girlfriend not to be suspicious about Amanda and him making up afterwards. On the other hand, Amanda had a few questions for Erika as well. Whatever it was that Fred was hiding from her, Erika was the only person besides himself that might know about it. Once again, Amanda noticed the tired look in Erika's eyes. Considering what the other woman had been through, this was absolutely understandable. 

"I have to admit I'm a bit surprised that you actually showed up at the hospital, not to mention forgiving him," Erika began. "Actually, I thought you were too proud to overlook something like this. What changed your mind?"

So she was suspicious after all.

"I don't really get it myself. Maybe it's because of his condition, but his apology sounded really sincere. I know it sounds naïve, but only time will tell if we really get back together or whether we're just prolonging the inevitable."

"Did he … tell you why he cheated on you?" Erika sounded more curious than testing here.

"Only partially. He said he wanted to use her connections, but not what for. Do you believe that? He said it was too personal for him, after he cheated on me!" Amanda thought it would be best to be direct. "Do you know anything more about that?"

Erika shook her head. "I knew nothing about the whole affair." She took a sip from her drink. "But the fact that he's so secretive about it narrows it down."

"So you know what he's hiding from me?"

"You could say that. There's only one thing that he really didn't want you to know."

"And what would that be?"

Erika gave out a loud sigh. "Don't dig any further. If he says it's too personal then you should respect that. Build up the necessary trust for him to tell you, if you're really interested."

"Hello? He cheated on me! Don't I get any credit for that?"

"It’s a bit more complicated than that. Fred hates being pitied and he’s fully aware that his current state encourages this. In a way, he’s swallowing his pride here, too."

"You’re not seriously comparing these two, are you? I mean ‘being pitied’ isn’t exactly a deal breaker like cheating is." Amanda then remembered a conversation she had with Fred before. "Wait, do you want to imply that his 'breaking up because she was overprotective' story is real?"

Erika blinked a few times, showing that she was surprised. "He told you about this?"

"Yes, a few months ago when he had the flu. I thought this was just a joke to prevent me from nursing him too much. Did he really break up with a girl because she went overboard when it came to nursing him?"

"Um, yeah. But she really had it coming. She tried to nurse him, even when he was fine." Erika took a deep breath. "What I wanted to say is that you shouldn't exaggerate his condition. Don't give the impression that you only made up with him because of that and you should be fine."

Amanda sighed. Now she had to downplay an injury she herself had caused.

 

 

The date was going great from James' perspective. They had reached the restaurant without any complications, chit-chatting the whole way. Once they had taken their seats and placed their orders, their conversations drifted to their jobs. 

"… long story short, I'm an assistant," Michelle finished her rather long job description. 

"So, technically you're a full-fledged reporter, but you don't actually appear on TV? Why is that?"

"I'm quite shy and when I started, other candidates proved more useful in front of the camera. So I settled for the second row."

"Do you have any intention of changing that? You don't seem that shy to me and I'm sure you'd make a great anchorwoman."

Michelle blushed and looked away, all while trying to hide her smile. God, she's adorable when she's embarrassed. James couldn't help but smile as well.

"I did think about it, of course. But after a while I got used to my job and thanks to recent events I'm really not interested in this kind of promotion anymore."

"What recent events are you talking about?"

"The meteor scare of course. Can you imagine how it felt to see my colleagues adding fuel to the fire by concentrating on the worst case scenario which ended up being missed by several miles?"

"Oh yeah right, the media wasn't exactly helpful back then. But wouldn't that encourage you to change the way information is handled?"

"Easier said than done. When the whole industry only seeks sensation it becomes hard to change it all by yourself.”  

James could easily empathize with her; after all he had a few things he didn’t like about his own job as well.

“How about yourself?” Michelle suddenly continued. “What does a scientific consultant for the police actually do when he’s not knocking on my door on a Sunday morning?”

"Oh that's simple. When the police finds something out of the ordinary, they call me to check whether it really is."

"Out of the ordinary? Did they expect small green men to come out of the meteor?"

"No, but the public already feared that a rock from outer space could bring the end of the world. The program is more to calm it down, actually. Unfortunately, this means most of my cases are downright boring and the police used this fact to get some additional tests done that they can't do due to budget or time constraints."

"That doesn't sound too bad," Michelle said. "My superiors would turn it into a corruption scandal, though."

"Why is that?"

"You're doing work meant for the police while neglecting your own - that's the part that they would focus on. The fact that your job consists of helping the police would mean nothing to them."

James suddenly felt anxious. "And what is your opinion about that?"  

"Me? Well, you're doing your job and by assisting the police you're actually doing a public service, so it's hard to find anything wrong with that. The only 'out of the ordinary' case I know about is some boulder that had been moved. By the way, are there any news on that one?"

"Actually..." A sudden shudder went over James. He did have a theory about how that boulder got moved, but it might be a big mistake to share it with Michelle. She was part of the media after all. Spreading the news of superpowered women flying around would be just another day at work for her - not to mention a boost for her career. And he would be the security leak. This was one big dilemma. Until now everything had went great between Michelle and him, he honestly believed that there was some kind of connection between them. Still there was the possibility that those feelings were one-sided on his part and that she was merely using him. No! He needed to get rid of this paranoid thinking as soon as possible or otherwise it would poison the whole evening. "… I'm still operating on the 'a person lifted it' theory."

"I thought you said this boulder was too heavy to be lifted without proper equipment." James was surprised that, instead of laughing at such an outlandish idea, Michelle asked in barely a whisper.

"Let me show you," there was only one way to go for James, but this didn't make him feel any better about it. He took out his smartphone and began looking for the video file that would explain his theory. Once he had found it, he presented it to Michelle. 

It wasn't like it had been this afternoon where he had presented this video to a couple that had already heard about the existence of superpowers before. Hell, the man had even met one of them before. James watched as Michelle's eyes stayed fixated on the small screen in her hand. Concern was written all over her face. This was to be expected; after all she didn't know that the hostage would survive.

"Why are you showing this to me?" Michelle asked in a shaky voice once she was done watching. 

"You asked about the boulder, right? My theory is that she - or someone like her - moved it."

"S-someone like her?" Michelle seemed like she was about to freak out. "Are there more like her around?"

"There's been word of a redheaded woman," again James was surprised at his own honesty. He realized that while he didn't know whether or not he could trust her, this honesty could come back to bite him. "Excuse me for a second."

James then stood up and made his way to the bathroom, leaving his phone with the compromising video behind.

 

 

Sitting alone at the table, Michelle's tried to organize her panicked thoughts. How much did he know? Why did he even tell her about such an important discovery? Just because she asked? No, he most likely suspected her already; this was the most logical explanation. Did he just want her to make a mistake that proved his suspicions? It didn't feel that way. Actually it felt more like it was quite the opposite, like he didn't want her to confirm his fears. Michelle hadn't missed that James was nervous. In fact his nervousness had been contagious as it was the main reason she was nervous as well. Michelle noticed that James' phone was still lying in front of her. She wished she could just delete this video of her and be done with this story. But she knew things wouldn't be so easy. Sooner or later her actions would become public knowledge. It was a miracle that this video hadn't made it to the news yet. Most of her colleagues would simply take the camera or copy the file to present it to the world. Michelle was pretty sure that even if it wasn't her on the video, she wouldn't want to spread this news. Maybe she could convince James not to show it to anybody he met. It would calm her down if he agreed, after all.  

 

 

James splashed cold water on his face. He had barely managed to set a trap that would decide whether or not Michelle was trustworthy - or if he had already screwed up by showing her the video. Thankfully he had some nasty surprises hidden on his phone that would make any attempt to copy the video file futile. The only way to publish this video was to steal the phone right now - in which case Michelle wouldn't be waiting for him at the table anymore. And if she was, a quick check on his phone would prove whether she had tried to copy it. He had made these precautions more out of legal reasons, so that he couldn't become a security leak should he lose his phone. To think that it would help him ease his unreasonable paranoia had a certain irony to it.

James returned to their table and smiled once he spotted Michelle still sitting there. Once he sat down, he picked up his phone and checked the file - and his smile grew even broader. Why had he even thought this woman was capable of something so underhanded? 

"What's the good news?" Michelle asked.

"I just noticed that you're just as nice as you look." Okay, that one was cheesy, but Michelle blushed nonetheless. "You didn't try to copy this video file, meaning that showing it to you wasn't a mistake."

"That's good to hear," Michelle indeed seemed to be relieved. James was just happy that she wasn't offended by him fearing such things. "I already wondered why you showed me such delicate information in the first place. Do you have any idea what would happen if this got published?"

"I've given it some thought, but in the end there are too many unknown variables. The most important part would be the "how" it's published. And the meteor scare was a good demonstration of how not to. If this woman continues like this, she will sooner or later become public knowledge. It'll depend on how good a job she does to determine whether she inspires hope or fear."

"What's your opinion about her, then?"

James hadn't expected to hear this particular question. It seemed strange to talk about a totally different woman on a date, especially if he didn't know that other woman.

"It's a bit unreal that there's a real person that seems to be more fitting for a comic book than reality. But from what I heard so far, she really seems to fit the term superhero, wouldn't you think?"

"There's no arguing on the 'super' part, but I don't think she should be called a hero yet. From what I see, there's no actual danger for her during the whole fight. Her priority should have been the safety of the hostages, but instead she went after the criminals first. You can clearly see that she screwed up the moment the hostage got retaken. It was written all over her face."

"You may be right, but things aren't as easy as they are in fiction. Getting the hostage to safety sounds easier than it might be, so maybe attacking the kidnappers first was the best chance she had?"

"And if she had a better way but didn't use it?"

James shrugged his shoulders. "Everybody makes mistakes, I guess. I don't think it would be that good to openly point them out. The point is that she wanted to help and succeeded. She's basically doing a public service, it's hard to find anything wrong about that."

Michelle turned her head away as she blushed once again. She must have recognized that he had returned her own statement about his work to her.

"I take it you're a fan of hers, then."

James had to gulp hard. This was the most dangerous question she could've asked, and that slight smirk that was still on her face made it clear that she knew this. She was messing with him!

"I don't really want to use the term 'fan' here as I don't really know that much about her. She's flying around helping people and unlike the police, I don't see her as a problem."

"So the police doesn't like her?"

"Not her specifically, but the idea that there are people with superpowers can become quite disturbing. And while this woman really seems use her powers for good, others may not be that
nice."

"If there are others, right?"

"There are. I mentioned a redhead before who may be connected to her. She's only appeared once so far and even the victim admits it was an accident. But even if she's nicer than expected, the fact that there are two of them increases the chances that there are even more."

"I see, so the cops are more concerned that there may be a criminal with these powers. Can't blame them for that."

"Yeah, let's just hope those two women are the only ones." James thought about the dead prostitute and how she would fit into the story. Then he realized that their conversation had become quite serious and that this wasn't exactly the mood he had intended for this evening.

"Do you have any theory as to how they got their powers?" Michelle seemed to enjoy this topic, though. "Could it be related to the meteor?"

"I've got no idea," James admitted. "I've yet to receive the report as to what they found out about the meteor, but I doubt this will make any change. The best way to find out might be the woman herself, but that's not going to be easy. Well, there's still the autopsy."

"What autopsy?"

James wanted to mentally kick himself for even mentioning it, but found that he had begun to trust Michelle and valued her opinion.

"The police found a drug victim that turned out to be somehow mutated. Her DNA contained many more chromosomes than the human DNA was supposed to have. A comparison with old hair of hers showed that she originally possessed the 23 pairs normal for humans, but at the time of her death possessed 27 additional pairs."

"Any idea about what these extra chromosomes do?"

"None so far. The only outward sign was that she looked much more - uhm - healthy than she was supposed to."

"And by healthy you mean more attractive?" 

"Both. She had been a drug addict for quite some time, and it showed in past photos. The corpse I saw didn't show any signs of this, as if she had been at perfect health again. It seemed like her drug history had been cleared from her body - which most likely caused her death."

"Any idea how that happened?" Michelle now sounded really concerned.

Again, James had to shrug his shoulders. "Your guess is as good as mine. My first idea was that it was caused by some kind of drugs. There's no hint so far that it's connected to the two superpowered women" He tried to sound as convincing as possible, as he could see Michelle becoming more and more anxious - something he instinctively wanted to prevent. "Let's change the subject, shall we? It's kind of awkward to talk about other women when the most beautiful woman in the world sits right in front of me."

Michelle rewarded his compliment with a smile.

 

 

Amanda entered her apartment with a loud sigh. Her head hurt like hell and Amanda knew full well why it did so. She had planned to make Erika spill the oh-so-big secret she and Fred were keeping from her, by getting her drunk. Normally, this would be a futile effort as Erika could hold her liquor quite well. Amanda had thought that increased resistance to alcohol would be one of the many tiny improvements she had been subjected to. And technically she was right, just not in the way she had expected. It took her only one drink to realize that she was getting drunk faster than she normally would. Her body processed the alcohol much faster, which included a fast approaching hangover. Of course, her plan to get Erika drunk was doomed to fail this way. Amanda considered herself lucky that Erika hadn't noticed her condition; after all she didn't need any more suspicion from her. Now she was at her apartment and her hangover hit her with full force. It was tempting to skip her suffering by drinking the super potion, but the last time she had done so had ended badly, so she would have to wait it through. After all, it wouldn't take that long for her to recover and she wanted to prove to herself that she wasn't reliant of the super potion.

 

 

Time sure flew by for Michelle and eventually she stared dumbfounded at her finished dessert, realizing that their dinner was about to end. She took a glance at James, who seemed to have similar thoughts. Except for the short moment where both of them had been almost afraid of each other, they had a really good time together. In fact, Michelle had absolutely no doubt that James dreaded the end of this evening just as much as she did. Now that she thought about it, it was a bit strange that she was so confident in knowing how James felt. This reminded her of how Amanda had claimed to know for a fact that Fred hadn't been lying about still loving her. It had sounded like wishful thinking back then, but right now Michelle understood what her best friend had meant. She felt somehow connected to James, and began to wonder if it was more than just a metaphor. Amanda's words were echoing in her mind: 'Just be yourself and determine whether or not you love him. If you do, and he loves you too, then you should tell him asap.' Why did this pop up in her head now? Not too long ago, she had been scared of him finding out and now she was … curious.

"About these superpowered women, you mentioned earlier. What is your job about them exactly?"

"Officially I'm researching everything out of the ordinary, which includes them, of course."

"So, you're hunting them?"

"That's what it boils down to. Chances of success are slim enough for my superiors to 'entrust' this job to me and in case I do find something, they'll just let someone else handle it."

Michelle could clearly feel his anger over this situation and she had no trouble sympathizing with him about it.

"That sounds quite demotivating. How do you keep yourself going?"

"Curiosity," James didn't even have to think for this answer. "I became a scientist because of that and nobody can argue that my job has its exciting parts now."

"But it sounds futile if you're not really able to research anything," Michelle retorted. "What good is it to track something down if someone else steals the glory afterwards?"

"Good thing I've got a certain amount of freedom, then. After all, they can't take away information that I already possess. They may have cut me off the mutated drug-addict, but I do know a few things about her - not to mention my connection to the police. They also know that there was a moved boulder in the mountains and that it was most likely moved by this blonde superchick, but I may have forgotten to mention the pajama pants that led me to you."

When he put it that way, it was a damn miracle that he still hadn't at least considered her to be involved.

"Thanks, I really appreciate that."

"It was nothing and it would've left a bad first impression to draw any unnecessary attention towards you. You deserve better."

Michelle blushed at the honesty of that comment, and the unspoken affection that had caused him to act that way. He mainly wanted to help her - and he hadn't even intended to tell her this. The fact that she was above suspicion for him had played only a very small part in James not mentioning her to his superiors compared to this. Michelle also realized that the only reason she was above suspicion, were the radically different looks between her normal form and her super form. James simply hadn't considered the possibility that there was a physical transformation involved that turned her body into a living wet dream. One good thing about him not knowing her secret was that he didn't fall for her just for her super looks. Unable to hide her happiness about this, Michelle began to smile even more.

God, she's adorable when she smiles.

What was that? Michelle looked surprised at James, who was just in the process of drinking. It had sounded like his voice, but he clearly hadn't spoken. Must've been someone else.

James paid for the meal and the two of them made their way back to his car. Neither of them said a word during the drive. Michelle didn't really pay attention to the road as she watched James from the side. He was focused on the traffic and used it as a means to ignore his nervousness. Her heart began to beat faster as she realized just how much he wanted this drive to last longer, to make a detour just to spend more time with her. But doing so, would startle her and so he did the only thing he could do, to prolong it: drive slowly. Fate was on his side as there was no free space before her apartment for him to park - or stop.

"Seems like you'll have to park a little further away and walk me to my doorstep," Michelle teased.

James did as he was told - with a broad grin on his face that he thought invisible due to the darkness in the car. Once they had left the car, Michelle seized the opportunity and grabbed his arm so that they walked arm in arm. With great joy she remembered the couples she had watched on her first night on patrol. Right now she had no reason to be envious of them.

"Well," James began as they had reached the door. "I ...uh... had a really good time tonight. I mean, you're a fascinating woman, that... no, what I wanted to say is..."

Michelle interrupted James helpless stammering by gently putting her index finger onto his mouth.

"You seem at a loss for words right now, so let me do the talking. I also had a fun time tonight and I'd like to repeat it rather sooner than later. Yes, I know you were going to ask me that, because you're so much of a nice guy that you'd rather ask this instead of what you really want to ask. So instead of trying to come up with the right words how about you try to come up with the right actions?"

Even though it sounded as if James had a choice, the reality was that Michelle already had made it for him. As she spoke, her face had steadily gotten closer to his and in the end her finger seemed the only thing separating their mouths from each other. With their faces so close, they stared each other in the eyes. Michelle teased him for a little longer, savoring his undivided attention before finally removing her finger. Immediately their lips met and for Michelle this moment was magical. Never before in her life had she felt this happy - and considering the recent events in her life this really meant something. A stream of emotions washed over her. Michelle suddenly saw pictures of herself from another person’s view. From the angle it seemed like the other person was at least a foot taller than her, but Michelle didn't even need this information to realize that she was somehow seeing flashes of James' memories. Besides a few flashes that must've been from their initial encounter yesterday, all of them were from this evening - including the very moment before their kiss. In this memory she seemed equal in height- a sign that reading his mind and feelings wasn't the only extraordinary thing Michelle was doing right now. Under normal circumstances these news would have been the focus of her attention. But right now, while she literally tasted his affections that only added to her own, Michelle didn't care about petty things like how she wasn't supposed to have any powers right now. And so the fact that she was hovering a foot above the floor remained unnoticed by the two lovers who had only one thing in their mind: Them.
