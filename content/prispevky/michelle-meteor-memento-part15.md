Michelle bit her lip as she used her X-ray vision to keep track of the situation. After a fight with James she had visited her sister for some counseling about that - only to be disturbed by her sister's girlfriend. 
<!--more-->
This wouldn't be much of a problem if she were in her normal form. But she wasn't. In order to travel the five hundred miles that usually separated the sisters, Michelle's super powers had come in quite handy. While she had no problem telling J.J. about her recent ascension, Kelly however was a whole different deal; Michelle didn't know her enough to include her.

So the first thing Michelle had done when Kelly entered the apartment was to super-speed into the next best room, only to find that it didn't have a big enough window for her. Now she was pretty much stuck here, unless she wanted to do another round of explaining.

Through the wall, she saw how Kelly went through the usual homecoming routine - taking off her jacket, kicking off her shoes and then giving J.J. a kiss as a greeting.

"Hey," J.J. said a bit anxiously. "How was your day?"

"Far too long," Kelly mused as she hugged J.J. "I couldn't wait to get back here. And now I need a shower." With a smirk she added, "Wanna join me?"

The nervousness on J.J.'s face was now hard to miss. "Uhm," she began.

Michelle's thoughts raced as well, and she quickly put on the water in the shower before shouting, "Sis, could you lend me some of your clothes after the shower?"

"Y-yeah sure!" J.J. answered over an increasingly confused Kelly before addressing her. "My sister dropped by for a visit. And as you can hear, she's in the shower."

Kelly was obviously surprised by that - after all, she knew that Michelle lived far too much away for her to stop by unannounced. Still, she shrugged. "Guess I have to wait, then,"
before kissing J.J. once more.

Michelle on the other hand switched off her X-ray vision and faced herself in the bathroom mirror. Now that Kelly was aware of her presence, she needed to transform back to normal ASAP. Thank goodness she had spent several hours practicing just that skill today. This training had also shown that she had too much energy to transform back. But her body had already shown her a way to deal with that, too. Hurriedly, Michelle began looking for a suitable container.

The best thing she found was an empty soft drink bottle. How and why it had ended up in the bathroom was a mystery to Michelle, but she was just glad she had found something for this. Quickly she cleaned it up with hot water, while double-checking that the door was indeed locked, before disintegrating her costume. Now finally naked, Michelle held the cleaned bottle to her chest and concentrated on transforming back, forcing the super energy out of her and into the bottle. Her chest began tingling and soon she saw confirmation as her breast leaked supercharged milk into the bottle. It took her a whole minute of concentration before she came close to her actual goal. By now her power level had been reduced to the point where she could will herself back to normal - or at least normal looking.

Closing the bottle again, she took a look at her mirror image. Her hair was brown again as were her eyes. And her breasts were back to their original A-cups while her overall figure slimmed down to her petite self. Happy that her transformation back had succeeded, she put the bottle of super milk down and began to hover under the shower.

 

 

"Wow," Jacob said as he looked down to see the city below them. On a clear night it was indeed a sight to behold.

What was more remarkable than the sight however was how he had found his way up here. After all he was being carried by a woman who could fly on her own. This woman, Desire, wasn't just carrying him, however. In fact she used some kind of power-sharing to make him just as weightless as herself. The only downside was that he was feeling dizzy because his body obviously wasn't made to fly around.

"I'm glad you like it," said Desire, her green eyes glowing in the darkness as she held him tightly.

From what Jacob understood, she didn't really need to hold him this tight, but who was he to complain? Aside from her incredible powers, Desire was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. Actually, to him she was the most beautiful, which said something given that he had encountered three other women who were in her league, whereas most people only knew about the Angel that had become a public figure not even 24 hours ago.

Jacob found himself staring into her eyes more than enjoying the view of the city that she presented to him. She returned his gaze and, despite the darkness of the night, he could tell that she smiled at him. A sweet scent entered his nose and he immediately knew it was her. The fact that they were several miles in the air pretty much left no possible alternatives anyway. Still, the way he could pretty much feel his arousal growing left no doubt about it.

"You really seem to be enjoying the sight," she teased sheepishly.

"Well," he felt himself blushing. "It is a privilege to see it after all." He wondered if it would be fine to kiss her. Normally he would take this chance in a situation like this - the worst that could happen would be the woman slapping him instead. A slap would hurt, but nothing more. This woman however was strong enough that a slap could kill him.

"Aww, don't worry. I won't bite." Desire's voice did her name justice.

"What? Are you reading my mind?"

"Who knows? I'm rather new to this whole being super thing. But it felt like you were afraid of me." She sounded sad. Jacob could almost hear the part she didn't say: I don't want you to be scared of me.

This encouraged him to take his chances. Not allowing himself to second-guess his decision, he leaned forward and kissed her. She clearly had expected him to do that, as she passionately answered the kiss. He felt her hold on him tighten as the wind seemed to speed up. The truth however was that Desire had picked up the pace, flying higher and higher as they kissed.

After about ten seconds they released the kiss, and Desire slowed down so they came to a halt again.

"Wow," they both said in unison before they both started to laugh.

"I didn't believe a simple kiss could be so … uplifting," Jacob joked as he noticed her sweet scent intensifying.

"Neither did I," Desire answered, "it seems like the joy through the kiss intervened with the natural joy felt by flying resulting in a feedback reaction where both increased each other."

"You lost me at kiss," Jacob teased. "But it sounded quite scientific."

"Maybe I should put it differently: You made me think happy thoughts, so I flew higher."

"Hm, I hope I don't make you leave the atmosphere if I do it again," he said before acting upon his words. This time, they remained in place, but it didn't make things less pleasant.

"I could get used to this," she said once their lips parted again.

"And I begin to understand why you called yourself Desire," Jacob commented.

Immediately her smile disappeared from her face. Jacob couldn't actually see her expression change - it was too dark for that. Instead he felt her mood darkening, not much but enough to make her frown.

"Don't call me that," she all but whispered.

"What should I call you then?" he still had to ask.

She leaned over and this time actually whispered to his ear. "Deziree."

If there was something that surprised him, then it was the fact how little this surprised him.

"Why are you telling me this?" Jacob had no doubt that this was the same Deziree he had met earlier today. "This could cause you trouble."

"Because you helped saving my life earlier. It felt unfair to lie to you in return." She then looked him straight in the eyes. "Will it cause me trouble?"

"Not from me," Jacob answered, now trying to compare the goddess before him with the woman he had met earlier. "And I wasn't the only one involved, in fact I was the least useful."

"That's not true," Deziree encouraged him. "You carried me when I couldn't walk, and you helped me out when I truly needed it. Most importantly, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here."

"You're overestimating my help, really. It was me who told Ms. Harland about the liquid that powered her up."

"Which ultimately led to her leaking the milk that transformed me into this," Deziree countered. "All because of you."

"So you... didn't even use the potion we secured?" Jacob asked.

"No," Deziree shook her head, before suddenly kissing him again. "But you're giving me an idea."

 

 

After a quick shower, Michelle gave herself a final once-over in the bathroom mirror. This would be the first time where she would have to play normal while still having super energy inside her. During her shower she had managed to prevent an unnecessary transformation, and once she was out of the apartment this first test run would be over already. Still, she had asked J.J. for some clothes despite locking the bathroom door, so she couldn't just create a new outfit.

Dressed in only a towel and hiding the bottle of milk inside, she settled back onto the floor before stepping out of the bathroom. Michelle may have kept her normal form all the time, but that hadn't prevented her from being airborne all the time. Now, however, she needed her masquerade to be perfect.

Stepping into the living room, she found J.J. and Kelly entangled on the couch. Once they noticed her, they let go of each other and faced her.

"Hey, Michelle," Kelly greeted her, and she looked a bit surprised as she did that. "Wow, you look good, did you start working out?"

"A bit," Michelle lied. She was once again reminded of the slight changes that affected her normal form as well. Good thing it had been a while since she was last here, making it a lot easier to pretend that this was just a normal development for her.

"Alright," Kelly jumped out of the couch and walked past Michelle, giving her a teasingly seductive look. "Hope you didn't use up all the hot water."

 

 

Kelly smiled as she entered the bathroom. Usually her teasing would make Michelle feel uncomfortable, but today she seemed a lot more composed and confident. She bit her lips as she allowed herself to fantasize of a threesome with both Jenkins sisters. Kelly had always noticed how similar the two of them were, and what she had seen just now was a lot of improvement on Michelle's part. “Maybe J.J. and her should get more into sports, too,” she thought as she stripped down in front of the bathroom mirror. Kelly giggled a bit as she could still smell Michelle's lingering scent and she began to dance a bit in front of the mirror. For some reason it felt vitalizing despite her being quite exhausted after a long day. “Hmm,” the thought of watching J.J. work out together with her was quite something.

Crunch.

The sudden noise brought her out of her fantasy as Kelly noticed a slight pain under her right foot.

Looking down, she found she had stepped on a small glass vial with some greenish liquid that got quickly mixed up with the red of her own blood. Where that vial had come from, she didn't know.

"Please don't be poisonous," she thought.

 

 

"I hate to break it to you, but it seems like my bras won't fit you anymore," J.J. concluded, "no matter how much you try to will them smaller."

Michelle tried to ignore her sister's snarky remark. She had indeed tried to decrease their size just a bit more, but apparently her normal form had slightly bigger breasts than before. It was barely visible, though, and it had only showed after she had tried on one of J.J.'s bras.

"Ah, screw this," she said aloud and went for the obvious solution by willing herself a fitting bra into existence.

Now J.J. stood there with her mouth open. From one moment to another, an almost exact replica of the bra Michelle had just tried on appeared on her frame - this one fitting her however.

"So, aside from being super sexy, you can even create clothes?"

"Yep," Michelle answered with a smile as she put on the top that J.J. had laid out for her. This one was more forgiving of her new measurements. "It's a bit exhausting, however."

"A small price to pay don't you think? I mean you've been whining about being stuck in that Super Barbie form, but where exactly lies the downside here?"

"Well, if you don't see being a half-alien hybrid and the fact that eventually I won't even be able to pretend to be me anymore as a downside, then there aren't any." She held up the bottle of super milk. "In that case you'll probably want to take this."

J.J. gulped before shaking her head. "N-not before asking Kelly," she said.

Michelle frowned. "I should've seen this one coming."

"After whining about how your boyfriend didn't drink this stuff, you should have."

"Actually this isn't what I wanted him to drink. This is my milk, so whoever drank it would become related to me - which wouldn't change much for you, but for James it would be disastrous. I had a vial of the potion for him that didn't cause that kind of problem."

"Sounds complicated."

Just then the both of them heard a loud scream coming from the bathroom.

"Kelly?" J.J. stated the obvious and already took off towards the source of the scream.

Michelle followed her closely.

"Kelly, are you alright?"

There was only a whimper behind the closed bathroom door.

"Why, why, why?"

Michelle could still pick up Kelly's almost silent cries and instinctively she used her X-ray vision to see what the problem was. She almost screamed herself.

"Come on, I can hear you crying in there; what’s up?"

"N-nothing," a shocked Kelly tried to say but it was no use, her crying made it obvious that things weren't okay.

"Then open the door and let me see, sweetheart."

"No, I don't want you to see me like this."

"Actually she'll want to," Michelle interfered. "It's going to grow back immediately."

J.J. looked at her quizzically as she had no idea what Michelle was talking about. "Kelly, please open the door! I don't want to have to break it." It was obvious that it wouldn't be her who would break it anyway.

Still, Kelly complied and unlocked the door, allowing J.J. to open it.

"Oh, my God," was all Michelle's sister could say.

The woman that stood there was barely recognizable as Kelly, but neither J.J. nor Michelle doubted that she was. Kelly's face had turned stunningly beautiful and now sported glowing blue eyes, but her hair had fallen out. From the neck down however, she seemed to be the same Kelly as before. At least Michelle suspected that the slightly chubby body was still unaffected.

"What's happening to me?" she asked at the verge of tears.

It wasn't hard for Michelle to figure this one out. From the corner of the eye she saw the broken vial with super serum on the floor mixed with blood that was obviously Kelly's. Michelle's heart sank as she realized that this had been the potion she had intended for James. She had carried it around all the time and had forgotten it when she disintegrated her costume earlier. Kelly must have stepped on it and became infected with the potion, as she was now obviously in the middle of her first super transformation.

"It's going to be okay," J.J. calmed her down before turning around to Michelle for clarification. Her brain may not work with super speed, but she had gotten the gist of it

"You're transforming," Michelle said calmly, "and you'll like the outcome."

Now Kelly seemed to notice Michelle and her glowing eyes widened. "Why are you glowing like that?" she asked to J.J.'s increased confusion.

Sighing, Michelle prepared for a full explanation. "I'm not glowing, you’ve simply gained the ability to see the super energy that's inside of me and you’re confusing it with a glow." She pointed to the broken vial on the floor. "You can see it there too. It's what is transforming you. Your hair will regrow and your whole body will improve until you look something like this."

To prove her point, Michelle triggered her own transformation. Her hair grew out and turned blonde. With the super energy already inside her body she transformed almost instantly, growing a whole foot in height as her muscles took on fitness model proportions and of course added several cup sizes to her breasts. The top she had borrowed stood no chance of surviving her new measurements.

Naturally Kelly yelped in surprise, and even J.J. stared at her despite knowing that Michelle could do that.

"Y-you... a-are... t-the.." Kelly stammered, but Michelle didn't let her finish.

"I'm still Michelle no matter what the media say. And by the way your hair is starting to grow out again."

Sure enough, Kelly's hair was growing quickly. Unlike her former blonde hair, this one was auburn in color, pretty much the opposite of how Michelle's transformation had gone.

"It's beautiful," J.J. commented, more to comfort her girlfriend than commenting on the outcome. After all it was still only a few centimeters long and thus far from its final length.

"Will it … hurt?" Kelly asked. "I had some nasty headache earlier."

Michelle shook her head. "The headache was the worst part of the whole thing. From now on its steadily going up, until you literally can't keep your feet on the ground anymore." As she said that Michelle remembered her own first transformation and subconsciously began hovering again.

Kelly's eyes widened, but not as much as they had when Michelle had transformed. After all her ability to fly was her best known one. Her hair was about to reach her shoulders, and Kelly turned towards the mirror in surprise. Smiling, she felt her hair before turning towards J.J. again. "I think we need a bigger mirror," she said before leaving the small bathroom, surely going to the bedroom and its full length mirror.

J.J. didn't wait long to follow her, but she grabbed Michelle's shoulder when she thought Kelly was out of earshot. "Please tell me this wasn't your plan all along."

Michelle couldn't believe her sister thought this of her. "Sis, I swear to God I had no intention for this to happen. Not like this, and honestly, not to her either."

The relief was visible on J.J.'s face. She clearly preferred to trust Michelle, but given the strange coincidence she had to ask. "Alright, I believe you," she said before picking up the pace to catch up to Kelly. "You still owe me a top, though."

Smiling, Michelle looked down at the remnants of said shirt. In her demonstration she had ruined the borrowed piece of clothing, but right now Kelly's ascension was more important. There was only one first transformation for everyone, and after missing Amanda's Michelle really looked forward to seeing the most important changes happening to Kelly.

When they arrived in the bedroom, Kelly was admiring her mirror image as her hair was already reaching down her back. J.J. quickly positioned herself behind Kelly, looking over her shoulder as they both looked into the mirror.

"Looking good," she whispered into Kelly's ear. By now she was as excited to see the next step of the transformation as Kelly herself.

Michelle took the opportunity to switch on her super senses to their upmost capacity. She concentrated on Kelly's body and the changes going through her but also used J.J. as a comparison.

"Something's happening," Kelly exclaimed as Michelle saw a wave of super energy going through her. Through her own experience she knew what this was for, but now that Kelly was looking forward to the outcome, she saw no need to spoil the ride for her.

Then it began. Kelly's body cells started dividing themselves at an incredible speed. Slowly, she grew in height. Both women let out a gasp as they noticed, and J.J.'s hand traced Kelly's stretching body as if to confirm her growth. Kelly's excess fat disappeared in the process, dissolving to serve as fuel for the new cells. So aside from growing in height, Kelly also slimmed down in the process.

As she watched the growing difference in their bodies, Michelle also noticed that both women were getting aroused. She remembered the transformation had that kind of effect on her too, but so far it seemed to be mostly J.J.'s caressing that did it. It helped that J.J. had more and more trouble looking over Kelly's shoulder as the latter simply became too tall for that. J.J. didn't seem too bothered by this as she compensated by fondling Kelly more.

A moan escaped Kelly's lips as another surge went through her. Now that she had grown over a foot in height and slimmed down, it was time for her muscles to adapt to the power they would soon possess.

"You have to see this, Jessica!" Kelly said, urging J.J. to watch her mirror image again.

"I'd rather feel it," J.J. answered, giggling as her hands traced Kelly's what had once been a slightly flappy tummy and was now in the process of becoming one hell of a six pack. "Feels kinda warm," she exclaimed. "But it's only natural if you turn hot, right?"

"You have no idea," Kelly turned around to kiss J.J., who gasped as she saw how toned Kelly had become in this short time.

The kiss quickly became more passionate, and apparently they got lost in it. Instead of turning back to the mirror to watch the final stages of the transformation, Kelly made her way towards their bed with J.J. in tow. They fell down on the bed, with Kelly first on top, but quickly they switched places as she let J.J. explore her body.

Had Michelle not been focused on what happened inside their respective bodies she probably would have given them their privacy. She wondered if the two were even aware of her presence now.

Kelly didn't notice that her muscles were done growing, as J.J. was occupied kissing and fondling her. What she did notice, however, was the pleasant surge that marked the last change to her appearance. With a smile she guided J.J.'s hands towards her breasts, and Michelle's sister gladly focused her attention to them.

"Oooh," Kelly let out a loud moan as the sudden pleasure caught her off-guard. Michelle couldn't blame her; the feeling of her breasts expanding was nice enough, but adding someone’s fondling of them is outright orgasmic. She still concentrated on the changes that had gone through Kelly, which was increasingly harder to do thanks to J.J.'s actions.

The moaning and growing continued for a bit until Kelly's breasts had reached their final size, leaving her body in a very similar shape to Michelle's own. From her estimation, Kelly ended up about an inch smaller than Michelle, but a hint more muscular in the process. Due to her being slightly smaller, her breasts looked a bit bigger on her than they did on Michelle, but one needed super senses to even notice differences on that scale. The biggest difference remained their hair color; Kelly's was auburn as opposed to Michelle's blonde. Interestingly, their eye color was matched, something new considering the bright orange or even golden eyes on Amanda and Susan respectively.

"Oh … my… Go-o-o-o-o-d," another moan accompanied the climax of her metamorphosis, as Kelly's body was now infused with the super energy and all the powers it could use thanks to it. She rose from the bed, instinctively taking J.J. with her. For a second, Michelle was concerned about J.J.'s safety. As much as Kelly would love her sister, having her strength level explode from human to superhuman during an orgasm was dangerous for a mortal like J.J., but she had it covered. On a truly instinctive level, Kelly's super energy entered J.J. to protect her from her own strength as she enjoyed the peak of her pleasure several feet above her bed.

“I guess she has the power-sharing trick down already,” Michelle thought to herself.

 

 

"So you think that the potion will be the solution to all your problems?" James asked.

After the painful topic about Michelle's and his argument, he had managed to bring the topic to Amanda's recent experiences. From her own issues with her boyfriend, his hospitalization and how that had somehow managed to put them back together. This had ultimately led to her discovering the truth about his condition - and to their eventual engagement. The conversation then had returned to her plans to utilize the potion to save her fiancé's life.

Seeing that their conversation was getting dangerously close to going back to his issues with Michelle, he had tried to steer it into another direction with the aforementioned statement.

"Well," Amanda hesitated for a second, "if you put it that way, it sounds too good to be true, right? But if used correctly it can pretty well be."

Her confidence in the matter surprised him.

"What do you mean ‘if used correctly’?"

Amanda took another sip of her Coke before answering. The fact that she had switched to non-alcoholic drinks before he had, despite her immunity to alcohol, hadn't gone unnoticed.

"If it weren't for the potion I would still be single," she began. "I would consider the man I love to be evil incarnate for having cheated on me with no clue as to why he did it and that his life had been on the line. No matter how much I regret hurting him, by making the best out of it I was able to learn the truth and reconnect with him. The powers helped there."

"Just because the powers were helpful doesn't mean you couldn't have managed to reconnect with him if you wanted to. From what I understood about your relationship, the actual problem was his secrecy."

Amanda sighed. "And despite all the weird stuff that happened, it took his sister dying for him to come clean with me…. which tragically was also caused by the potion..."

"See what I mean? Those who ingested the potion usually ended up worse than they started. She's not the first to die because of that."

"Please tell me you didn't say that to Michelle," Amanda's tone was getting more serious and the glare, with her flaming eye , made her several times more intimidating than she probably intended. "She's aware that the changes to her body are so deeply rooted that she can't be considered human anymore. Someone with her self-esteem shouldn't be told that this is a bad thing!"

Now it was James who sighed. Their conversation had gone full circle and returned to his argument with Michelle. Her words popped back up in his head. "I had hoped for a bit more support here," she had said, and he felt guilty for not having provided it. Apparently all these feats of strength had made him overestimate Michelle. All he had done was call her out on her subconscious desire to have an equal partner and make her feel alone in the process.

"Uhm, excuse me." His train of thought was disturbed by an unfamiliar voice. Turning around, James saw a young Asian woman, probably around their age standing there, her eyes focused on Amanda.

"Yeah?" Amanda asked, obviously just as puzzled as he was.

It was pretty obvious why the woman addressed Amanda - her supernatural appearance stood out after all.

"Hi, uhm..." the woman stammered. "My name is Miu, and I … well... uhm..." she held out her hand. "Pleased to meet you," she finished.

Still puzzled by the other woman's nervousness, Amanda shook Miu's hand, and her eyes went wide in the process. "I see," she whispered.

"I'd like to talk," said Miu - apparently more confident now.

"Yes, definitely," Amanda hastily said, gesturing for the other woman to have a seat. To James she whispered, "She's been super, too."

 

 

Once Kelly's transformation was completed, she remained hovering in midair, carrying J.J. along with her. Michelle was getting uncomfortable as the two lovers seemed to only have eyes for each other. Kelly was aroused because she just experienced her initial transformation - and Michelle knew that this was a moment to remember - while J.J. couldn't get enough of her girlfriend’s new look.

"Uhm, girls?" she spoke out loud, wondering if she should have taken the chance to leave them alone. She didn't dare leave a newly transformed Kelly on her own, especially not with her sister.

J.J. however shot her a glare that pretty much screamed, "Couldn't you leave us some privacy?!?" while Kelly's expression was much friendlier. Lustful even. And this only served to increase J.J.'s irritation. Fortunately J.J. got over it rather quickly and blushed with embarrassment as she tried to get off Kelly. This proved harder than expected considering that the latter kept them a good foot above the bed.

Sensing J.J.'s trouble, Kelly brought them into a more upright position and put her back down onto the ground.

"So, how does this work exactly?" Kelly asked as she hovered back towards the mirror. Her eyes went wide as she saw her new reflection for the first time. "Unbelievable," she exclaimed. "This is just too good to be true!"

Michelle honestly wished it wasn't. While it definitely had been informative to watch Kelly's transformation with her improved senses, the consequences were quite substantial. After all, if she would sooner or later become stuck in her super form, this would also apply to any other super, Kelly included.

"I honestly hadn't intended for any of this to happen," Michelle began, trying to find the right words, "but the changes to you are major. Nothing will be the same for you again."

This brought Kelly down a peg. The tone of Michelle's voice made it clear that this wasn't all fun and games.

The three women went back to the living room where Michelle began her explanation of what the potion had done to Kelly. First, she decided to get her wardrobe back under control and was a bit disappointed when Kelly didn't follow suit, only creating a bra and panties that made up the very basics of clothing. J.J., however didn't seem to mind. And truth be told, Kelly's supply of super energy was rather limited, so it actually made sense not to waste it.

For the second time tonight, Michelle went through the whole story, telling how her own transformation had been less than voluntary and how she had ended up as the world's first superheroine - if the term applied. Kelly was surprisingly okay with the whole thing, even though Michelle made the downsides pretty obvious.

"So the bad news is that I'm not technically human anymore, and thus can't really reproduce with them? And that I'll eventually get stuck in this incredible hot body? With super powers too boot? What's the actual bad news then?"

"Don't forget the medical risk!" Michelle repeated. "One woman died of a drug overdose shortly after transforming back, another had a heart attack..."

"… Due to a medical condition she had beforehand. A condition that I don't share with her." Kelly finished the sentence. "And for the record: I don't do drugs either."

"By the way, didn't you offer the stuff to me just before Kelly arrived?" J.J. interrupted.

Michelle bit her lip. The conversation had a big resemblance to her argument with James - only that this time she was playing the role of James. Just like herself before, Kelly wasn't really concerned about the downsides. She was aware of the risks - her constant turning to J.J. proved that - but the beneficial effects far outmatched them. Now that J.J. brought it up, she had desperately wished for her sister to see it as a good choice despite the risks too.

"She did?" Kelly asked, surprised. "And what was your answer?"

"Well," J.J. seemed a bit embarrassed. "I actually said that I wanted to hear your opinion first."

"I'd say go for it," Kelly urged her on, and Michelle couldn't really disagree. "I'd feel weird if you didn't."

A smile grew on J.J.'s face. "Aw, sweetheart, we can't have that can we?" Then turning to Michelle, she asked. "Does your offer still stand?"

Michelle hesitated for but a split second. A part of her wondered: what if the population of superhumans grew too quickly? But over the last two days it had become obvious that someone was going around turning people super. And Susan had shown what could happen if this power fell into the wrong hands. J.J. on the other hand, was one of the few people who Michelle could blindly trust with this. With a smile she answered.

"How could I say no?"

 

 

Miu only hesitantly came out with her story. So far all she had mentioned was that two days ago she had been in a bar with a few friends and had encountered a ridiculously handsome man who had been more interested in her than any of her friends.

"Why do you think he picked you?" James asked.

"Well," Miu blushed. "First I thought he was hired and my friends were merely pretending to be competing. But given what happened afterwards, I think he chose me because I was the most miserable of our group - hell in the whole bar - actually."

"Don't belittle yourself," Amanda interrupted. "You're quite good-looking, even in your normal form."

She was right, although everyone involved was aware that the transformation left some traces on the person's normal appearance. Even Michelle had been improved compared to what she had been before.

"Thanks," Miu admitted. "But that's not what I meant. You don't have to be ugly to be a miserable wreck." Her head sunk a bit low as she said that. "Truth is that until two years ago I used to be a dancer. Whether it was ballet or hip-hop, I could pull off pretty much every dance there was. And I loved it."

"What happened?" Amanda dug further.

Obviously, the failed career story that was unfolding struck pretty close to home with her. James on the other hand was a bit more on edge.

"I was paralyzed," Miu exclaimed. "Through some dire twist of fate I lost my ability to walk or do anything with my legs, actually." She took another sip of her Coke having vehemently declined any alcoholic drink.

"Aww," Amanda visibly fought the urge to hug her.

"You can imagine how depressed I was when I was bound to a wheelchair since then. And two days ago was no different. Anyway, this hunk of a man asked me out, and despite my suspicions I left with him." Miu blushed as she remembered the night. "And the outcome was simply unbelievable. I mean, one moment I was a plain, scrawny girl, unable to walk, and the next I was some larger-than-life goddess that didn't need to."

"How exactly did that happen?" James interrupted. "Did he slip you something or make you drink anything?"

Miu shook her head. "I didn't drink anything. All we did was… have fun." She blushed further. "And it happened after we were done."

James slumped back. This was pretty much the same story Michelle had heard from Susan. No sign of the potion being consumed. Given that apparently a super woman's milk could double as the potion as well, why should a male super’s sperm be any different? But then, wouldn't that mean he'd turn his partner into a relative?

"It happened after you were done, you say. May I assume that you'd like to do it again with him if it gave you these powers once more?"

"Oh these powers have been great!" Miu exclaimed, but her expression became less and less enthusiastic about it. "But … I kinda don't feel like it." That last sentence was so full of surprise that it seemed she said it aloud to actually realize it on her own.

"What do you mean, you don't feel like it?" Amanda asked.

"I don't understand. Having these powers felt great. But to sleep with him again to gain them... I mean that was the best sex I ever had and still..." The confusion in her voice was steadily increasing.

"I think I know why you feel that way. Since he transformed you, you now consider him a family member. And thus you don't feel attracted to him anymore."

"Y-you mean that superpowers are like some kind of STD?" Miu now seemed concerned.

"At least when the man is super," Amanda commented. Obviously she had figured it out as well. "As for the other way around, this doesn't seem to be the case."

"Good," Miu let out a sigh of relief. "Last thing I wanted was to spread it around."

" What do you mean by that?" James asked. "Were you with others while you were super?"

"I'd rather not talk about that."

"Why not? Didn't it go well? Trust me, we won't judge." Amanda promised. "We all make mistakes after all."

James however wasn't so sure about that. "It would help a lot to hear all you've been through."

Miu looked at them nervously. "Alright, but I'll have to give you a bit more background first."

 

 

"Are you sure that stuff is actually milk and not some fluorescent liquid?" Kelly commented when she saw the bottle.

"You only see the super energy inside it, which is why you think it glows. But for anybody else it doesn't glow at all," Michelle explained.

"Then this bottle contains more power than both our bodies combined!" Kelly exclaimed.

Michelle had to agree. She had powered-down so that she could transform back to normal, so the majority of her power had gone into that bottle. As for Kelly, her energy supply was even less, because she had only absorbed what little potion had entered her blood stream.

As for J.J. who couldn't see that difference in power, she was quite shocked to hear that. She sat staring at the bottle in her hands second-guessing her own decision.

"Uhm, Michelle?" she began. "Could you give us some… uhm… privacy?"

That wasn't exactly what she had expected, but, given how she had felt out of place during the final stages of Kelly's ascension, Michelle couldn't argue here. Things would probably get steamy here.

"Alright, I'll take my leave then. Don't drink it all at once, and try not to cause too much destruction." She said before giving J.J. a goodbye hug. "And thanks for your comfort."

"Any time, Sis. And don't worry; if he's the right one he'll come around. You just have to give him time to get to know you better."

Once they were done, Michelle made her way to the window and gave the couple one last look before she took to the night sky.

Coming to a stop high above the city, Michelle tried to sort things out for herself. The whole deal with Kelly had distracted her from her own little problem. She wondered how James would react when he learned that she had created two new supergirls. He probably wouldn't like it at all. With a sigh she began her trip home, the landscape becoming a blur under her as she picked up the pace.

 

 

Miu's story turned out to be much more dramatic than Amanda had expected. The young Asian woman told them about how she had lost her ability to walk. She had been at the wrong side street at the wrong time and encountered the wrong man there. He pulled out a knife, raped her and - as if that wasn't bad enough - had stabbed her several times in the back while he did it. Afterwards he left her for dead, but Miu survived and was found. She was unable to identify the man who did it and, thanks to the injuries he had inflicted, she was paralyzed from the waist down.

Amanda fought back tears as she heard the story. Saturday night, when Michelle had showed off her powers to her, someone had tried to rape her as well. Unlike Miu, Michelle had been far more than that man could've handled and easily took care of him. As far as Amanda knew, her best friend had stopped more than one attempted rape in the meantime. But two years ago, Miu didn't have that kind of power - or luck, for that matter.

Taking her hand, Amanda asked the question she didn't really want to hear the answer to.

"What did you do when you had this power?"

"Revenge," Miu flatly stated. "I tracked him down and repeated our little encounter. Only this time, when he tried to stab me in the back, he didn't even make a scratch." She held up the mangled remains of a knife. "My skin was stronger than steel, and my thighs more powerful than his bones. He's alive, but he won't be able to hurt anybody again."

"He'll never be able to walk again," James commented. "Quite extreme for revenge. If you found him that quickly, why didn't you call the police?"

"You don't know how it felt like to be broken - to have nothing worth living for - and then suddenly being able to do whatever you want." Miu blurted out this part, her emotions getting the better of her. "I … suddenly knew how to find him. It was strange, all that time I had cursed the fact that I wasn't able to see his face, and then I am capable of sensing him halfway across town. Even when I found him, I wasn't sure until he tried to stab me during the act." She looked at her drink as if in deep though, obviously going through the scene in her mind, her eyes glassy. "When all you have to do is flex your thighs, you don't wait and call the police. I had no proof anyway, at least none that they would've accepted. I'm not proud of what I did, but it gives me closure." Tears were now running down her cheeks. "I've never hurt anybody like this before."

If what she said was true, this guy truly had it coming. And Amanda wasn't really in the position to judge anyway. She herself had put her boyfriend into the hospital shortly after becoming super. Hers may have been an accident, but she could understand how Miu, who suffered a lot more than her, saw it fit to dish out justice. And still...

"Well, I'd suggest that you take this to the police if you really want closure. I know the officer leading the investigation actually, so I could arrange things to go as smooth as possible for you. What I'm more interested in is how you managed to track him down all over town. How exactly did this work?" James tried to change the topic.

Amanda doubted that Jacob and Deziree would return anytime soon. The former would obviously be quite interested in the story.

"I don't know. It was like I felt where he was. After figuring out I was super strong, I thought about getting even with him and then … it was like I had a supernatural radar going or something like that. I just knew in which direction he was, and when I found him, he made it easy for me to confirm it was really him."

"I see. Did it feel like you were straining to do that? I mean sensing someone over the town could be relatively easy to do. Maybe you could do it right now if you tried?"

Miu shook her head. "I lost all super powers mere moments after getting my revenge. Which is a good thing, actually. As nice as they were, I wouldn't have any use for them anymore. Being plain old me again was all that I wished for."

"You're not plain old you again," Amanda interfered. "I could tell that you had these powers merely by touching you, and so can any other super regardless of whether or not they have powers at the moment. Long story short, you're a different being altogether, and given enough time, these powers might return on their own."

Miu's eyes widened, the gravity of the situation becoming clear to her. Amanda felt bad about having told her, and wondered if she should really go into detail about how exactly these changes worked. The poor girl had no idea that the changes tracked back to an alien plant after all. 

"This is … are you sure about that?" she whispered.

"I don't know about a case where it fully happened yet, but we’ve had both a woman that stayed in her enhanced appearance while losing her powers, and one that was starting to be able to use them while in her normal form. In short the powers aren't gone, you're just lacking the energy to use them. Eventually your body should find a way to generate it on your own."

"W-wait wouldn't that mean I'll be stuck as Amazon-me then?"

"Most likely."

Miu looked down her body as if to mentally compare it with her super form. "Wow... I hadn't expected to hear something like that..."

Amanda took her hand. "Don't worry, you're in good company. We may not know everything about what is happening to us, but we'll get to the bottom of it eventually. After all, we have scientists like James working on it."

Miu turned to James. "Really? There's a lot of research going on about this?"

"I wouldn't put it that way. Of course, we are trying to research this phenomenon, but we're lacking actual research cases. So far we only have a bunch of dead women to perform an autopsy on. It's not like superpowered women are too eager to be guinea pigs. In fact the last superwomen who entered the lab caused a lot of property damage during their … argument. With a bit of luck the loser may be convinced to help us out from now on."

"I see," Miu exclaimed before turning to Amanda again. "How about you? Are you helping there as well?"

That was a good question. "Uhm, actually not. But now that you mention it, maybe I should consider lending a hand in the future. What do you think, James?"

James looked at her like she had just decided to eat a baby for dinner. "You're not serious, are you?"

"Why not? You just said yourself that you only have corpses to work on and I'm pretty sure that I'd be a bigger asset than you-know-who. Plus, how better to get the necessary information about my fiancé's problems than at your facility?"

"I can hardly see you cooperating with the lead expert on the subject. Didn't you hate him? And doesn't he hate your fiancé, for that matter?"

He definitely had a point here. The idea of cooperating with Prof. Harland of all people made her stomach twist. But Amanda had higher priorities.

"I'm not doing this for my sake. And I'm willing to go quite far for my fiancé."

"Uhm," Miu fiddled with her hands nervously. "W-what kind of tests are we talking about? Would it help if I volunteered, too?"

 

 

Half an hour later, James returned to his place. What had started out as an attempt to get superpowered women out of his head had far too quickly turned into the very opposite. The good news was that the mystery Asian had not only presented herself, but also seemed a lot nicer than her victim’s state had implied. The bad news was that supers were popping up at an alarming rate now. What would happen if that went on for much longer? He didn't dare to think about it.

The closer he got to his apartment the less he thought about the other superwomen and the more he thought about the first he'd met of them. It didn't surprise him in the least that he saw light coming from his apartment. He already knew that Michelle was there and had been for quite a while. The strange mental connection between them made it hard not to know where she was. Opening the door, he heard the water running in the shower. That gave him a bit more time to figure out what to say.

One thing that quickly struck him was the hole Michelle had created during their argument. Or rather the fact that it wasn't there anymore. Michelle had been true to her word and fixed it. Which was why she took a shower now. Something told him her previous shower wasn't that long ago.

The water stopped running, and shortly thereafter Michelle hovered into the room. James gulped as he saw her. With her body still in her super form, dressed only in a towel and slightly wet everywhere else, he could barely string together a coherent thought at this sight. One thing was sure though: After talking to equally-enhanced Amanda and Deziree, it was still Michelle that utterly blew his mind.

"Hi," she whispered, blushing slightly at the effect she had upon him.

"Hey," he answered just as awkwardly, stepping towards her. He felt a constant urge to rip that towel off her body, but right now a hug would do.

"I'm sorry about earlier," she continued. "I just couldn't stand the feeling of you disagreeing."

"Shh... no harm done," he answered. "I'm the one who has to apologize. I should've known that the whole situation isn't as easy for you, either."

They continued to hug each other in silence for well over a minute, before Michelle spoke up again.

"I've made a huge mistake. My sister and her girlfriend... they're super now, too," she all but cried as she whispered that.

"How did that happen?"

"Let me show you..."

Once again Michelle flooded his head with information. About how her sister’s girlfriend had accidentally stepped into the potion Michelle had originally intended for him to drink. When it came to her transformation, the whole thing seemed to happen in slow motion, with different overlaying images that he could barely register all together. His head hurt trying to process the sudden information overflow that Michelle had stored in her memory. 

"Wow..." he exclaimed as the vision ended. "Seeing things from your perspective is indeed something else."

He could hardly be mad at her for making a mistake, not after this kind of vision. Any scientist would kill having this kind of view when the process was at work - even though he could barely process it. Maybe his opinion was biased by the fact that the information management at the lab was abyssal, but this whole link to Michelle and her supernatural perception was becoming his outright favorite powers.

"I'm glad you see it that way," she whispered. "After all, these are my personal powers."

James eyes widened. He knew about those - Amanda's heat vision, Ms. Riley's ability to create permanent clothes, Ms. Harland’s mind control, Deziree's invisibility and Miu's super radar ability - but none could hold a candle against Michelle... at least not for him.

Even though they were staring into each other's eyes, he could practically feel her smile grow brighter as he came to that conclusion. After all, from what they had learned, these powers seemed to be at least partially affected by the user's personality. Simply put, the fact that he loved Michelle's personal powers more than any other was a subtle sign that he loved her as well. Not that he needed that hint.

"If you like it that much, how about I show you even more? So far I only gave you small glimpses of what I've done until now, and in my depowered state no less. Wanna see how Amanda's second transformation looked in slow motion? I think I could even make it easier for you to understand this."

"How would that work?" James almost expected her to suggest drinking the potion to solve that issue.

"Of course not. For some reason, I made a link to the plant that gave me these powers. Even though it doesn't have any brain or intelligence of it's own, I could share part of my brain for it to use. If I do the same with you, you should be able to perceive things the same way I did without getting a headache."

"You never cease to amaze me. I probably won't get such a detailed view on a transformation of yours, would I?"

"Not a third person view, no. At least not without the same kind of powers. But I could share with you the detailed memory of how it felt to me. Last time I only gave you a rough version."

"You really wanna do this do you? Shouldn't we talk about our little disagreement first? "

"Correct me if I'm wrong, but your main issue with taking the potion and becoming super is that you'd settle with me, and feel that we don't know each other enough for that kind of commitment. Through our bond, I already know you a lot better than I should after such a short time, but it seems like you don't know me as well. Apparently the bond works better for me, so it's only fair to let you catch up."

James couldn't argue with that. She was right. If she really could read him like that all the time, then she would know him a lot better than he did her. Balancing things out would be the only plausible solution, no matter how he looked at it.

"Alright, you've got a point there."

"Good. Then let's lie down for this; I'll need my whole concentration."

He didn't need to be asked twice. Not a minute later, they were lying in his bed, her on top of him, partially floating, her eyes glowing bright before....

 

 

James suddenly found himself standing in a white space. Michelle hovered naked in front of him and he noticed that he was naked as well.

"What is this?" He thought it to himself, but found his mouth asking the question out loud.

"Some kind of mental meeting place," Michelle answered. "I used it to talk to the plant, but it took me a while to realize just who I was really talking to. Anyway, this space enables me to share my memories in the most effective way. Is there anything you would like to see first?"

"I don't know, actually. There are so many things I want to know about you that I can't decide where to start. Maybe you could decide where to start?"

"Alright, then; how about I start small and show you how I found the seed that changed my life?"

 

 

He nodded and the white space disappeared, to be replaced by the streets of the city. Somewhere downtown; a usual place for Michelle to go on a walk. James noticed that the images were blurry at times, especially the faces of the people walking around. That was only logical considering this was Michelle's memory from three months ago. While she had a clear knowledge about the buildings here, she had not paid too much attention to the people around her. Except...

One man going in the opposite direction stuck out. Unlike the others, he was clearly visible, meaning that Michelle had bothered remembering him. A sudden wave of animosity came over him and as he wondered whether he was getting jealous of this guy, he noticed that this was actually part of Michelle's memory.

They passed each other, and past Michelle gave him an aside-glance. “At least pretend to recognize me, asshole!”... James could hear her thoughts from back then clearly. Unfortunately her attention would have been better spent on the pavement, as she suddenly slipped and fell on her back.

"Ouch," he heard Michelle exclaim as she landed. The people around her, commenting her misfortune with a slight laugh, but generally not paying her too much mind. The man however, turned around and laughed wholeheartedly.

"You better watch your step," he joked before a loud growl made him grab his stomach.

"... And you better watch your food," Michelle countered. "Apparently your last meal was from before the evacuation."

With gritted teeth the man turned around, and with hasty steps was probably about to find the next bathroom. James felt Michelle's mood lighten."Well, there really is a God," he heard her think before she noticed just what she had tripped over. Before her lay a small, brown almond-shaped object. Michelle picked it up and figured it must be some kind of seed. Given that this was the first day after the evacuation ended, Michelle decided just then and there to plant it as a memento of that day. Just to see what kind of plant it was.

 

 

The white space returned, as the memory was over now.

"The rest is easily explained, I planted the seed, it grew into the plant you've seen at my nightstand, and it produced a liquid that turned me into this."

"What about the man you met there? You seemed to hate him."

Michelle averted her gaze.

"Let me guess, he was an ex-boyfriend of yours." James said.

The blonde amazon shook her head. "That would be giving him far too much credit. He was just a one-night stand. And it was my own mistake to believe we would be more than that."

"Sorry to hear that," James walked over to hug her.

"It's okay. He was an episode of the past, but you are the present." Michelle blushed as she added, "And the future."

"You wanted me to get to know you better, how about you show me how it went with him?"

Michelle's eyes widened, yet her blush didn't disappear. "Y-you sure about that? That wasn't exactly a good episode of my life."

"Which is exactly why I want to see it," James answered. "You already gave me glimpses of your heroic deeds, showing how great you can be. But for us to work as a couple, I will also have to know your bad sides, and who knows? Maybe I like what you consider these bad sides?"

Michelle gulped, but nodded. "That would be great. OK, I'll show you."

And so she did. For the next few hours Michelle did nothing but show James episodes of her life. True to her word she gave him full disclosure, a leap of faith that dwarfed everything she had done so far.

 

 

The night at the hospital felt a lot less lonely than the day for Fred. The news that his sister had died had been more of a shock than he had expected. He thought he had been mentally prepared for this to happen. That Amanda had been digging in this very wound hadn't helped there, especially due to the changes she had gone through these last few days. On the other hand, the very fact that she was still there for him had kept him sane for now. After all, the reason Erika died even before her time was that she, for a short time, had the same kind of powers as Amanda had.

At least that's what Amanda had told him earlier today, when everything had become clearer – yet so much more complicated. Now they were engaged, something he hadn't even dreamed possible. His problems hadn't decreased: he still had a ruined knee and a heart that would fail in a few years. Still, it felt comforting that Amanda knew about that now. When she had exclaimed that they would solve these problems, he had believed her. Had it been because of her new powers? Of these abilities that defied explanation?

Fred felt compelled to look outside – and wasn't surprised as he saw a figure just outside the window, a woman with a long red mane and glowing orange eyes opening the window from the outside. What surprised him was that Amanda's outfit was a lot more casual than her last one when she had come here in her super form. Not that he was complaining about the tight jeans and the sexy top, but he remembered her mentioning that her ability to create clothes wouldn't allow an outfit like that.

"It's been a present of sorts," Amanda whispered as if to answer his thoughts directly.

"From who?"

Amanda's face darkened a bit. "Erika," she whispered again. "This was her individual power that she passed on to me. Remember when I told you about the little fight we had because she didn't know it was me? She gave me some of her energy and apparently a boost for the whole clothes creation ability."

"You are full of surprises," Fred exclaimed.

"And I haven't even started yet," Amanda giggled, placing her hand on his knee.

Fred expected the pain to instantly go away – like always when Amanda did that. But this time she seemed to be trying something different. Instead of disappearing, the pain actually got worse – and he could see the strain on her face.

After about a minute, she gasped and stopped whatever she was trying. "Alright… the whole healing power part... will take a bit longer. But it looks like I made some progress on that front. If I can keep it up, you'll be walking by the weekend."

"I wouldn't believe it if it weren't you saying that."

"Aww," Amanda leaned in for a kiss, which he gladly returned. "Like I said, I have some news for you. There's good news, bad news, and important news. Which one would you like to hear first?"

"Let's start with bad news. I have a feeling it won't be the worst news I hear today."

"You may be right. Still, the fact that Susan Harland became super too is definitely bad news."

"Please tell me you are kidding."

Amanda shook her head. "Which bring me to the good news: Michelle took care of her."

"Michelle? Oh I get it: she's the one who saved Erika back then... shouldn't you have tried to keep that to yourself?"

"Nope. She told her boyfriend about me, so why shouldn't I tell my fiancé? Don't worry, she'll be fine with you knowing."

Fred rolled his eyes. "Of course she will! She's way too trusting at times. Remember that one guy she hooked up with thinking it was her soulmate? Didn't go beyond a one-night stand, if I remember correctly."

"Would you rather have her be bitter and disillusioned about it? Sure, she's been quite trusting and leaves herself wide open at times. But the way she's willing to believe in people is what makes her so good at helping them."

"Can't argue with that." Actually Fred didn't know Michelle well enough to actually argue at all. "I just hope she's not in over her head. If these superpowers are popping up that frequently, it would be best if the poster girl remained one of the good guys."

"Don't worry, if worse comes to worse, I'll talk some sense into her," Amanda exclaimed as she slid under the blanket. Her clothes dissolved into thin air, leaving her in only a bra and panties. They kissed again, slowly.

"So what is the important news?" Fred asked. He knew he was rushing things here, but, with her so close, his rational mind was eager to take a vacation.

"Well, you did hear that these powers come with a significant mutation that basically turns me half-alien, right?"

"Yeah," he nodded. That train of thought made it easier for him to remain focused, though.

"As you can probably imagine, the different number of chromosomes makes it pretty much impossible to reproduce..."

Fred gulped. "I-if you want to tell me that you can't have children, then it's okay. All I remember about my parents is that they died far too early, and that both Erika and I had inherited their condition. I don't really like the idea that my kids would suffer a similar fate, so it wasn't really high on my agenda to have any."

Amanda's face darkened – due to her eyes not glowing as bright anymore. "Well, I fully intend to fix that little condition of yours. And actually, you turning into a half-alien hybrid like myself would be part of my agenda, too."

"Wouldn't I die just like Erika?"

"I'm still trying to figure out a way to prevent that. So far the best lead would be Susan. Apparently she didn't transform back to normal after she was out of power. That could be the key to saving you."

"I see. I don’t know too much about these powers of yours, so I'll trust you on that. If you think you found a way to cure me, I'll go along with it. Even if it means to go down the road that killed my sister."

"And the becoming half-alien part wouldn't bother you?"

"You still look and act pretty human, so it can't be that bad. Besides, if this really cures me, then this would apply to any children of ours too, right? In that case we could really start a family!"

Amanda simply smiled at him, her eyes shining bright again, maybe even brighter than they did originally. "I'm glad you see it that way." She then picked his hand and placed it on her belly. "Because it seems like we already started our family."

His eyes widened. Hadn't she just claimed that she couldn't get pregnant from him due to being super?

"That’s right," she once again answered his very thoughts. "But apparently I was already pregnant when I drank the potion…."

 

 

"That was… something else," James exclaimed when the bond broke.

Michelle couldn't really disagree, but she didn't feel like answering right now. Enabling James to look this deep into her soul had taken its toll and used up the rest of her super energy. And as her body returned to it's normal state, the exhaustion hit her like a train. From one moment to the next the bond was gone, and they barely had gotten to the good stuff.

What was left was a feeling of loneliness she hadn't felt for several days. The fact that she was now in her plain state didn't help at all. She fought back tears and turned away from him.

"Is everything alright?" James asked.

"Yes, everything is fine," she pouted.

"You're a bad liar." He came closer. "Are you hurt?"

"No, just exhausted. I've been up for quite a while, you know?"

"That makes it two of us." He hugged her from behind. "Still, that's not what it is, right?"

Michelle almost shivered. Right now she felt very self-conscious. She hadn't expected things to get that… private. After taking the leap of faith of showing him the mistakes of her past, she had intended to make it up by showing him all the incredible things she had done after her transformation. The problem was that even she wasn't proud of them.

"I'm just a naïve fool that happened to be extremely lucky, am I not?" she said.

"What? You're not a fool! What makes you think that way?"

Michelle sighed. "All the things I did with these powers, they weren't that much to speak of."

"That's not true! You saved people after all!"

"I only delayed things for Erika! I didn't save her at all. In fact she was already safe when I interfered. I only made things worse." After everything that had happened today, this was still the harsh reality.

"You made a mistake, fixed it, and learned from it. That's a win in my book. And I didn't mean Erika, there were others, too."

The image of the young girl popped up in her head. "Everybody can jump into the flames or catch a bullet when they are invulnerable," she sadly announced. "Nothing special about me doing that then."

"You couldn't be more wrong!" James almost shouted. "After all, you did it, not someone else. By now we know that there's someone passing around these powers, yet none of them has done anything like you did. Sure, you may be lucky to have found the seed, but of the five supers I met today, you're the only one who’s helped anybody. Actually you're the only one who didn't use her powers to hurt or steal at all!"

That comforted her a bit. Being the one out of five did raise her confidence a bit.

"Besides," James continued. "Given that you were the one that was all over the news today, it may the reason things change in the future. If someone gets these powers in the near future, they will be reminded of you and either follow your example or at least refrain from causing trouble out of fear you might deal with them."

"Aww," Michelle turned around to face him again. "You're just saying that to cheer me up!"

"I'm serious. You're carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders, and you're past the point where you can bail out easily. So I figured you need all the support you can get... and I'm terribly sorry to not have given it to you right away earlier."

He leaned in for a kiss that somehow helped to wash all her bad feelings away. Despite her weakened state, she could feel their connection again. And through that connection she could hear one thought loud and clear:

*If she asks me again, I won't say no.*
