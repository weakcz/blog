Michelle stared at the container, trying to process the events of the last hours.<!--more--> What had started with her trying to learn how to be super, yet look normal, had soon turned into her having to rescue her boyfriend from another woman with the same kind of powers she had.

The whole ordeal came with a lot of new revelations, and a few spoils of war to boot. For one, there was a container of super potion that she had taken from the lab where James worked. It was proof that the scientists there had access to another superpower granting plant and would now obviously redouble their research efforts. Michelle had taken this container not to stock up on super potion, though. Hell she already had enough to be able to share it with her best friend, so it obviously wasn't necessary for her to get more. If it weren't for the one side-effect that turned those who drank the potion of the same plant into - for the lack of a better word - siblings... this batch wasn't meant for her, but for her boyfriend. The naughty part of her brain already imagined how their lovemaking might be if they were on the same level.

However, the other spoils of war weren't much to her liking. During her fight with Susan, she had managed to convince the latter to transfer all her super energy to Michelle, leaving her with a lot of extra energy. And with this extra energy came whatever individual powers Susan had developed on her own. Michelle knew that this woman had the ability to control other people's minds, and that she had done so mostly subconsciously. For someone who valued the freedom of the mind as much as Michelle, this power-up felt more like a curse that she would never use. Still, another of Susan's apparent unique abilities disturbed her even more. Even after transferring all her energy to Michelle, the other woman had not transformed into however she had looked originally. If that was also an individual ability of hers, then Michelle was probably just as stuck in her super form. In that case her double life, as a reporter at day and a superheroine at night, was over already - after only a few days.

Her only comfort right now was that it didn't feel like that at all. Michelle could feel something new, but was pretty convinced that this was the mind-control power she had gained. But nothing that would refrain her from transforming back to normal from what she could tell. Still, the issue ate at her, and Michelle needed an answer. Sitting cross-legged above her couch, she closed her eyes and entered the place where she expected to find the answer.

 

 

She was quite familiar with the white space now, so it didn't surprise her when her doppelganger greeted her with a warm smile. It was this familiarity that made her notice the difference right away. Where before her doppelgänger had looked exactly like herself, she now had... slight differences in her appearance. Her hair seemed a bit darker with a strange hint of green and her normally blue eyes had a greenish tint.

These changes confirmed Michelle's suspicions. This doppelganger wasn't a part of herself, after all. Neither was she a personification of her instincts nor a split personality. She was the plant that had given her these powers in the first place.

"You look good," Michelle commented the changes on her doppelganger.

"Thanks, you too," came the answer.

Michelle now noticed that her doppelganger wasn't the only one looking different this time. She herself was in her super form instead of her original appearance.

"As always I come here with a bunch of questions for you," she began. "I tried to learn how to be in my normal form while still having super energy inside me. But it appears there are limits to that."

"Indeed there are," her doppelganger confirmed. "And I fear that your attempts may be futile in the end."

"Are you referring to the powers I absorbed from this other woman? She didn't transform back despite having no energy left, right?"

Her doppelganger looked upwards in thought, probably reliving Michelle's memories right now.

"Yes and no. You believe that her staying in this form was some kind of individual power she created, while in truth it was one that you possessed all along."

"Like flying and super strength? This doesn't make sense. I've transformed back whenever I ran out of super energy. I even managed to do it voluntarily."

"And you are still able to do that," her doppelganger explained. "This woman merely triggered the reaction that closes the door to her former self while you have yet to do so."

"What kind of reaction are you talking about?"

"She had reached the point where she couldn't store any more energy. This marks the point where the normal form outlives its usefulness and she stays in her improved form even when out of power."

"The point where she couldn't store any more energy?" Michelle remembered that Susan had drunk a huge amount of the potion from the container she had brought. Apparently this had triggered the effect. "So if I drink too much of the potion or absorb too much energy, I will be stuck in this form too? But why?"

"This smaller form uses up less energy, but also a limited capacity. You learned that yourself: your smaller form can store a limited amount before you either transform or eject the extra super energy."

"You mean when I suddenly leaked super powered breast milk."

Her doppelganger nodded. "Your super form can store a lot more super energy, but that too has a limit. Reaching that limit causes the cells that make up the difference between both forms to be permanently active, making it impossible to change back."

"So in other words this is meant to happen? At one point I am bound to reach this point and be stuck like this for the rest of my life?"

Her doppelganger nodded. "I'm sorry. This isn't what you wanted to hear, is it?"

"Don't be sorry," Michelle answered out of reflex. "I guess the evolution had little reason to consider the advantages of a double identity anyway. Not to mention that being stuck like this is far from the worst thing that could happen to me."

A smile appeared on her doppelganger's face. It was so genuine that Michelle couldn't help but respond in kind as the white space faded away

 

 

Opening her eyes again, Michelle had some new-found confidence. All she had to do was not absorb too much super energy, which sounded easy enough. And if it proved inevitable, she still had some time to prepare for that.

 

 

Deziree sighed as she finally reached her apartment. Today had been the officially weirdest day of her life. She kicked off the heels that had caused her to sprain her ankle earlier. Thanks to the "Angel's" magical bandage, she didn't feel any pain in her foot right now. Actually, she didn't feel any physical pain at all. Mentally, however, the whole ordeal had taken its toll on her. After all, she had not encountered one, but two godlike women whose simple appearance made her even more self-conscious than usual. Not to mention that one of them had tried to kill her.

She decided to take a bath to cope with today's events. Her clothes had suffered through the whole ordeal as well, with her partially ripped-off tights and the ruined backside of her blouse, she had preferred to wear a lab coat on her way home. Now in the privacy of her apartment, she quickly took off her clothes and inspected the damage her body had suffered today.

"Ouch," she exclaimed as she saw the numerous cuts and bruises that marked her back. Considering she had been thrown across a hallway, she considered herself lucky.

Lying down in the water, she thought about how unfair this seemed. Susan Harland had suddenly gotten herself some super powers and received a killer body as a bonus even when her powers were taken from her. Or had they worn off? Deziree didn't know for sure. But what she did know for sure was that Susan was the least fitting for this kind of powers. The spoiled brat that she was, she had used these powers for nothing but trouble, and it was lucky that she hadn't killed anyone.

Then again Deziree herself couldn't really complain. That magical bandage was somehow taking away the pain she should be suffering now, and Susan was eventually stopped and was now on her way to rot in a cell. And not without leaving some kind of reparation too. Deziree smiled as she thought about that. When Susan had drunk the strange liquid from the plant, she had exclaimed "too much" before she had started to lactate. Since Detective Spencer had been knocked out cold, Deziree had been the only one to witness that. She had managed to fill the milk into a few vials and sneak them out of the lab.

Now her thoughts trailed back to the theories she had about that. "Too much" obviously referred to the amount of liquid Susan had drunk. Even before learning about super powers, she had suspected that the liquid served as nutrition of some kind - similar to the milk of mammals. In short, Deziree suspected the milk to have a similar effect as the liquid. In fact, it could even be better adapted to the human body.

There was only one problem here: this was just a theory. She had no chance to analyze the milk for similarities and had impulsively decided to sneak it out. Now the only way for her to find out would be to drink it and see what happened. Would it transform her into a goddess like Susan and the Angel had been? Or would it be smarter to sneak it back in and make an analysis first? But there was no guarantee that she would be able to sneak it out again...

During her whole bath, Deziree thought about little else. The longer she thought about it, the more she considered the negative consequences of drinking it prematurely. Taking it slow and safe would be the best way to go after all. She got out of her bath and while she dried herself, she looked at her reflection in the mirror. Aside from today's wounds, her appearance was … plain. Her glasses and mousy hair gave her a kind of cute librarian look, but the rest of her body wasn't much to speak of. She was small in every possible way and lacked any womanly curves.

She frowned. Compared to the goddesses she had witnessed today, she wasn't even worth the breath it would take to ridicule her. Looking at her mirror image further, she began wondering how she would look if she were in their shoes. Why exactly did she want to play it safe again? Those women probably had no time to analyze things beforehand either, and she had spent three months examining that plant.

With newfound confidence, Deziree walked into her room to get one of the vials containing the milk. Stepping in front of her full-length mirror, she gave her naked reflection one final stare as she opened the vial. "Good bye!" she said before downing the milk.

The first thing she noticed was how sweet the milk tasted, but also another taste that she couldn't immediately put into perspective. For a moment she felt disgusted at herself for so readily drinking someone else's breast milk. That disgust however was short-lived as she immediately felt her stomach react to the liquid and a wave of dizziness came over her. Deziree was convinced that this was a good sign and considered sitting down, but she wanted to see the whole show and didn't intend to step away from the mirror.

It didn't take long for the dizziness to grow weaker. What replaced it however, was pain. To be precise, it was a headache. And although it was a small and rather tolerable one, Deziree realized that it was probably quite a significant pain as she looked down at the magical bandage. How much pain would she be feeling right now without it?

The more Deziree thought about it, the more she realized how much clearer she could think at all. Oh it was so clear now! The headache was caused by her brain being enhanced. After all, the superhumans had shown a wide array of abilities that the human brain wasn't supposed to handle, so it was only natural for it to adapt. She giggled, staring at her still unchanged reflection as she felt her sight getting worse. True, she wasn't wearing her glasses right now, but her sight was getting blurrier and then disappeared altogether.

"Oh my god," she exclaimed. Fortunately her blindness wasn't permanent, and once her sight returned, the pain left her head altogether. As she could make out her mirror image again, she immediately noticed that her eyesight had returned much better than it had been before. Now she could see a lot better than with her glasses, being able to make out details that she couldn't before. As she watched at her face, she noticed that her eyes didn't look the way they used to. Her greyish blue eyes had been replaced by vibrant green ones that glowed in their own light similar to what she had seen with the other superwomen.

Deziree stared at her mirror image, dumbfounded. Was it really happening? Was she really just in the process of becoming some sort of goddess? God she needed to pay attention to every tiny change that was going to happen from now on. Not only her eyes, but her face had changed as well already, having become downright gorgeous. She began to imagine herself in a body fitting that. A body like those women she had encountered today possessed, with the killer physique and this gorgeous hair.

Hair... Deziree's eyes widened as she felt a strange surge going into her head, followed by tingle on her scalp and then saw in the mirror image how it began falling down to the ground. She watched the fall in what felt like slow motion. Her hair, mousy at it was, was no longer part of her body. With utter disbelief she watched the pile of hair lying next to her feet, her thoughts racing, desperately trying to find an answer.

And they found it. She remembered this morning during the briefing, there had been talk about a how a drug-addicted prostitute had been the first documented case of this kind of mutation. They had found a large amount of unmutated hair in her apartment. Apparently this was a natural course of the transformation. This thought calmed Deziree down and she allowed herself to smile again.

As her gaze was still directed at her feet, she noticed that the magical bandage showed a strange glow now. Focusing harder, she saw how that glow faintly shimmered into her body, and she came to the conclusion that this was what had numbed the pain all this time. Actually that glow reminded her of the one in her eyes, and she put two and two together: This was what allowed the supers to do what they did. Deziree was surprised at how exciting this whole deal was becoming.

Feeling a strange sensation in her scalp, she looked back up to see that hair had begun to sprout again on her head. Her smile grew brighter as she noticed that this wasn't the mousy greyish brown she had before, but a vibrant black. The sight of it growing so quickly was rather unreal yet at the same time it felt so natural.  Deziree could even make out the strange glow at the roots of her hair that was probably the cause of that quick growth. Soon her hair had reached its original length and continued to grow further, reaching down her back. Deziree was beside herself. Her hair was clearly on its way to be on par with that of Susan and the Angel.

And what started with her eyes and hair would clearly apply for her whole body eventually. Right down to her genes. Deziree's eyes widened again as the scientific significance of the current situation became obvious to her. She had initiated her own mutation into some sort of half-human-half-alien-plant-hybrid. No matter how impressive the outcome, the process itself was still one of the biggest wonders she could think of at the top of her head. And it would only happen to her this one time.

This trail of thoughts increased her curiosity even further. She needed to pay utmost attention now; no sensation, no tiny difference was allowed to be unnoticed. As she thought about that, she suddenly noticed the mirror as well as her reflection disappearing as she saw the wall behind it, then the wall behind that...

"Oh my god," she exclaimed as she got accustomed to using her newfound X-ray vision. Focusing on her own body again, she was surprised as she was able to see the insides of it - even making out the strange glow inside her. She felt another surge going through her body and more importantly saw that it consisted of the same strange glow - although in a slightly different color.

The effects of that surge didn't take long for her to notice. Slowly but surely, she saw the cells in her body divide themselves quicker, as her body gained some height. It was unbelievable. Even though she had seen the outcome before, it was utterly unreal to see her body change from within, getting taller than her original 5'2" with increasing speed. On top of that, Deziree was surprised that there was absolutely no pain during the process, even though she expected such a procedure to be torture. Another part she noticed, that while she was growing, she merely gained in size. Her skinny body was still far from the toned amazons she had witnessed today. This didn't really bother her; so far the transformation had happened body part by body part.

She intently watched every part of her growth until she had passed the six foot mark and the growth slowed. Once it stopped, Deziree yearned for the next part to happen. Right now she was slim and tall, but still skinny, while the goddesses she had met before were everything but. Sure enough she felt another surge and saw how the energy washed over her body again, concentrating in her muscles. A wicked smile crossed her face as the next step was obvious.

The feeling as her muscles began to grow was incredible. While before the lack of pain had surprised her, the pleasure now had utterly taken her off-guard. Oh, she could get used to this! Especially since she knew that no matter how strong she would look, her actual strength would be far greater. Remembering her own astonishment as she had seen the news about the Angel this very morning, she allowed herself to laugh. "Strong enough to lift a freaking plane," she commented as the growth picked up the pace and she saw her abs gaining definition.

Deziree had a hard time deciding where to look as the process happened all over her body. The cells making up her muscle tissue divided themselves at an alarming rate, causing her to gain more and more mass. She also noticed that some cells seemed a lot smaller than others and was quickly reminded of the moment she had witnessed Susan drinking the liquid from the plant. At one point her muscles had seemed to inflate before shrinking back down. Could it be that both she and the Angel were even stronger than she had anticipated so far? From the looks of it, Deziree concluded that these cells - if grown to normal size - would cause a massive bulk up.

Truth be told, the feats of strength she had witnessed already were more than enough for her. It was the fact that she was now officially hot that mattered to her. And the feeling of her muscles growing was strangely arousing. Deziree let out a slight gasp. Not only was she becoming one hell of a hot chick, she already felt sexier than ever before in her life. Her thoughts raced. The growth process obviously stimulated her from the inside out, and with her added senses it was outright arousing. Things got even better when more muscle groups joined the fray, including those situated in her most private parts. From one moment to the next, her pussy began to tingle in rhythm with her growth.

By now her body had taken on fitness model proportions and Deziree loved every bit of it. At one point she had deactivated her X-ray vision to appreciate her mirror image. It was simply astonishing. Even though Deziree had a very good understanding of what was happening on a rational level, the feelings going through her body as it was magically changing into a hot amazon was simply unbelievable. She felt the growth coming to a stop and mentally compared herself to the goddesses she had encountered today. Deziree was close to them now, at least when it came to size and physique. Her pretty face was also on par with the others, while her dark hair was just a matter of taste. Those who preferred blondes would surely prefer the others over her, but those who preferred dark-haired women would chose her. There was just one part where she was still underdeveloped. Well, two parts.

Looking down at her bare A-cup breasts, she reactivated her X-ray vision just in time to watch and feel the next surge of energy go straight into them. "Oooh," she moaned at the sensations that came with it. If her muscle growth felt like a slow yet intimate massage of her whole body, this felt as if someone began to both fondle and suck on her breasts at the same time. At least that was how she imagined it would feel like. It was harder and harder for her to focus on the scientific parts of her transformation. After years of feeling undersized, her breasts were finally about to grow.

First her nipples became erect, and grew in size, then her whole breasts followed suit. Deziree was surprised by the speed at which it happened. The growth of her muscularity had been a slow, yet pleasurable process, while her breasts expanded on a much quicker rate. And the feeling of it was indescribable. Deziree let out a series of moans as she grew past the C-cup range and well into the D-cup in mere seconds. Her arousal reached heights that she didn't consider humanly possible - and what was left of her rational thought concluded that this was probably another benefit of her transformation. Still, even she had her trouble withstanding all the unexpected pleasure, so she was relieved when her breasts had reached their final size which she estimated to be DD.

Standing in front of her mirror, Deziree confirmed that her body now fully resembled those of the other supers she had encountered. From the looks of it, she was now officially one of them. She blushed at the realization of how aroused she still was, and tried to find a distraction. Focusing once again on the bandage that hadn't been impressed by her growth, she noticed that she could outright feel the energy still contained within. Suddenly she felt an urge … she wanted that power, she needed it. And the moment she thought that, the bandage began to dissolve, as the energy inside it moved into her now fully healed foot and crept upwards her leg to distribute itself over her entire body. At the same time, she felt much more of the same energy slowly beginning to build up, engulfing her whole body.

Deziree closed her eyes to try to figure out the details, but she quickly got lost in these feelings. This energy now felt like power itself, settling into each and every cell. It was like a thirst she didn't know she had suddenly being satisfied. This power that so far had changed her body from that of a plain Jane to a sexy goddess was now becoming part of her. For a few intense seconds, this feeling continued to wash over her body, constantly increasing her arousal until it filled her whole body. This was it: the transformation was complete.

Opening her eyes again, Deziree smiled as she took another look at her mirror image.  The woman who stared back at her hadn't changed on the outside, but was now giving out the same glow of power that she had seen in her eyes first. As she gave her body another once-over, she noticed that her feet had left the ground, leaving her hovering in midair.

"Unbelievable," she commented this new revelation as her mind was still numbed by the sheer pleasure she was experiencing. Deziree began tracing her hands over her newly transformed body, feeling the hard-cut muscle that was right underneath her flawless skin, all with her enhanced sense of touch. With a wicked smile, she led her hand to her pussy and let out a gasp at the sensation she felt. The arousal that had started to dissipate came back with full force as she shamelessly began to play with herself.

Deziree leaned back, one hand on her breast, another between her legs, both massaging her most sensitive parts. Now hovering in a horizontal position, she threw all rational thinking overboard. Engulfed in her own pleasure, Deziree didn't even realize the forces she used on her own body. The hand that massaged her breast did so with a force that could crush steel, while the one between her legs, vibrated at super speed. To her, however, this felt like a normal speed as her senses had kicked into overdrive, distorting her sense of time. To her, seconds lasted minutes, so when she reached her climax five seconds later, it had felt like a whole five minutes of masturbation.

"Oh... god... ahhh," she moaned as her wave after wave of orgasmic pleasure went through her, maintaining peak intensity for well over a minute - that lasted an hour from her perspective. Finally, she felt her orgasm subside and her senses return to normal.

"Wow," she exclaimed as she had finally gotten down from her high - figuratively, of course, as she was still airborne. She 'sat up' Indian style and tried to assess the situation. She had really done it! Drinking this milk had given her a super-hot body with a bunch of superpowers along the way. Concentrating on her flight, Deziree rose a bit higher, then descended a bit lower, turned around to fly upside down - it was all so easy, as if she had been born to do that. And the liberating feeling of being weightless... no wonder Susan had preferred to hover through the lab, not even trying to hide these powers. Deziree would have a hard time keeping her feet on the ground herself as she began forming her plans for the night.

 

 

"How was your day?" Michelle asked seductively and with a kiss that made it impossible for James to verbally answer for several seconds. She had flown over to his place, and thanks to their mental connection, he had opened the window in advance, allowing her to drop by quick enough to make it impossible for neighbors to notice her.

"W-wow, you kiss me like I was the big hero instead of you," James commented after they broke the kiss.

"I'm just happy to see you, that's all." Michelle answered, her seductive smile still in place. "Plus, I think we have something to celebrate."

"The destruction of a multimillion dollar lab?"

"Oh come on, don't be like that," Michelle feigned a frown.

"I'm just messing with you," he chuckled. "If it weren't for you, who knows how much more damage that Harland girl would have caused."

"Thou shalt be forgiven." she laughed, before she took on a more serious tone. "But kidding aside, something is on your mind..."

"You're inside my head again, huh?" he answered weakly. "Guess I can't complain. You can't help it and today this bond basically saved my life."

"I'm not doing it on purpose, which is why I only know something is on your mind, not what exactly it is."

"The fact that there's a lot on my mind right now helps a lot there," he sighed. "And I have to say, the chaos allowed me to perform a few tests, I otherwise wouldn't have been able too."

"Oh? What kind of tests?" Now Michelle was curious. Any test result about herself would help her understand herself a bit more.

"Well first things first, I managed to snatch a strand of hair from Ms. Harland, and it seems she got her powers from the same source as the other women we heard of: the drug addicted prostitute, the Asian and of course Ms. Riley."

"You managed all of that in such a short time? And what Asian?"

"Oh yeah, remember that man that was severely hurt after what seems like intercourse with a superwoman? According to the DNA she was Asian. The analysis of the other women was already done this morning. All I had to do was a quick test with Ms. Harland."

"I see. So they all gained their powers from the same man..."

"Hm, yeah Jacob mentioned something like that as well. That a man would be the link between the women. He assumed that he empowered them in order to sleep with them. Sounds quite plausible to me."

"Yeah, Susan's story basically confirmed that."

James gave her a strange look to which Michelle added. "What? You think I turn her over to the police without interrogating her first?"

"So what did she say?" James asked.

"She didn't drink any kind of potion, or at least she didn't notice. From what she told me, she transformed after having sex with a man who seemed to be super as well."

James face paled. "No potion? That doesn't make any sense. I mean these powers aren't exactly sexually transferrable. Hell, I'm living proof that they aren't."

"I didn't really understand this either. He probably slipped it to her without her noticing."

"Well if he was super it would be easy for him to do so." James thought out loud.

"But there's something that doesn't make sense," Michelle interrupted. "Why make her super after sleeping with her? That just sounds plain wrong to me!"

"That's indeed strange. Did she mention any reason why he did that?" James asked.

"No, he only said that she should have fun, but in a strange distant kind of way. Like he didn't even care about that. It's totally strange that he even shared these powers at all.  I mean, would you do that in his situation?"

"Um," James hesitated for a few seconds. "Well if I didn't care for the woman at all, then I sure as hell wouldn't slip her some super potion."

"Exactly," Michelle agreed with a smile. "And what would you do if you cared for her?"

James gulped loud enough that it didn't take Michelle's heightened senses to hear it. She didn't like this reaction.

"Well… um… I wouldn't give her the potion at all."

Michelle's face darkened as she heard that and James hastily continued.

"I mean look at it from this angle. The potion would change her in quite the dramatic way, making her a potential target of people interested in examining the potion and its effects on humans."

"The potion would also allow her to easily escape anybody trying to hunt her," Michelle countered.

James sighed. "We're not talking about that strange man anymore, are we?"

Michelle shook her head.

"Figured as much. I take it you brought the super potion you took from the lab earlier?"

He pointed at the bag Michelle had brought.

A few seconds of silence passed. He was right as Michelle had indeed brought a dose of that potion, a dose that didn't come from the same plant as her own.

"So, if I asked you to take it, you would decline?" Michelle's question barely hid the disappointment she was already feeling.

"I know that's not what you want to hear, but yes I would decline."

She had been secretly looking forward to the idea of having an equally powerful partner ever since her first transformation, and now that she had both a boyfriend and some potion that could fulfill her wish, she really didn't want him to decline.

"Why?" She asked.

"I already told you. The changes to the DNA aren't something to be trifled with. We have two fatalities already that were directly caused by the potion and not just someone misusing the power that comes with it."

"One of them was a drug addict who got clean without knowing it and tried her usual dose anyway! If she had known that, then this could have been her ticket out of that addiction!" Michelle's voice became louder as she spoke.

"And the other one died due to a very small genetic flaw that had shortened her lifespan considerably already. Who knows what other flaws could blow up in our faces?"

"This…," Michelle stopped herself from simply screaming nonsense back at him. Fortunately her enhanced senses allowed her to regain her composure almost immediately. "Look, it may sound hard to believe but I am hundred percent certain that nothing like this would happen to you. For all I can say it's instinctive, but so far my instincts were always right. After all they warned me not to give you the same potion I use. I only knew it was wrong, but you told me that this was because we would turn into some kind of siblings if we did that."

"And now that you found a fitting alternative, you think things are going to be fine?"

"Yes, I think if there were some complications to be expected, I would feel it somehow."

James sighed. "My answer remains the same."

"But…" Michelle bit her lip, barely hiding her disappointment. This definitely wasn't how she had imagined things to go. "Just imagine what we could do together," she began seductively. "Our lovemaking would be out of this world."

"Seriously?" James snapped back. "Is that all you can think of right now? People died because of this stuff! Hell, your best friend found a body today, I almost got killed by a superpowered spoiled brat, and all you can think about is sex?"

"Amanda is a tough girl, she's doing fine. And by the way you're welcome," Michelle retorted. Slowly but surely her disappointment was replaced with anger. She couldn't follow his logic at all. Why did he have to be against it?

"You're missing the point here! This is far too serious a step for me to take it just because you want to get knocked up!"

"What? That's not what I meant!" Michelle shouted back.

"Maybe you didn't mean it consciously. But the truth is your instincts are easy to see through. What your instincts want is to mate with a member of your own species, a man that has the same kind of mutation that you have and that could technically impregnate you. Right now, I don't fulfill these criteria."

"Member of my own species...," Michelle repeated angrily. "So that's what you think of me? A nonhuman freak?"

"I didn't say that!" James retorted hastily. "I just referred to the mutation you went through. Considering I'm working at a research facility that happens to research just that, I am pretty sure I would be found out in no time. After all, even transforming back doesn't mean I would go back to who I am now, right?"

Boom

"What the…?" James shouted out.

Michelle didn't answer right away. In the blink of an eye she had punched a nearby wall. Her slender hands had created a sizeable hole as Michelle was now facing away from him, her head hanging low. Slowly she took out the hand from the hole she had created, watching it for a second to make sure she had indeed not even broke a nail. Her vision became blurry however as the reason for her outburst came back to her and tears formed in her eyes.

"You just keep going on why you don't want to take it… seriously I had hoped for a bit more support here."

She didn't want to be seen crying in front of him, so turned around, making her way to the window through which she came.

"Michelle wait..." James started, not really understanding what she meant with that.

"I'll fix the wall," she said as calmly as she could. "But I need some time alone."

And before James could say any more, she had super speeded out of the apartment.

 

 

In the darkness of the night, the lab had a certain horror movie vibe going for it. Deziree remembered how today it had actually turned into one of the most dangerous places on earth as the mutated Susan Harland had gone on a rampage only to be stopped by the Angel. Their battle had been quite destructive, and Deziree had feared for her life - and not without reason. But now things were different. Now she was the one with the super powers roaming the lab. And unlike Susan, she had no intention of causing a huge mess, not even for the watchmen that patrolled the facility now.

Actually, this was the part that made Deziree most nervous. After all, she could hardly identify herself as someone who worked here with access to go to the lower levels. Even if the guards believed her that would mark the end of her career.

Back at home, when she had wondered if her powers could serve her to get in and out unnoticed, the answer had presented itself. A strange tingle had washed over her body and Deziree's mirror image had disappeared. It hadn't taken long for the young scientist to figure out that she had the ability to turn invisible and how to access it. Hovering naked through the hallways was a strange sensation, especially when she encountered a guard on patrol.

The man obviously couldn't see her, but he did seem to be aware that something was up. Floating up to the ceiling and lying flat against it, Deziree waited until he walked past her, but this guy decided to come to a halt right under her. She didn't waste any time and flew over him the moment he stopped, but despite the fact that she didn't make any sound, he seemed to have noticed her. The guard looked upwards to where Deziree had passed him, and the superpowered brunette noticed the tent in his pants.

Oh my god, she thought, putting two and two together. She may be invisible and took extra care of not making any sound, but her scent was still present. Now that she figured that out, she noticed that the man wasn't really paying attention to his surroundings anymore, but apparently was quite distracted by what he smelled. Of course, her scent was laden with her pheromones and like everything else on her, they were super.

Now that was an interesting revelation. The scope of her sexiness was even greater than she had imagined. Guys didn't even have to see her to be incredibly turned on. She wondered what would happen if she turned visible again. The thought of a supernaturally sexy naked chick materializing in front of him would probably drive him over the edge in an instant. Considering that she was still a virgin - and not by choice - this was one hell of a game changer. Still, this wasn't the moment for her to catch up on that.

Deziree continued her silent flight through the hallways and eventually reached her lab. Fortunately, it was unguarded even though a certain amount of the battle had happened here. The giant holes in the wall that Susan's body had created had the benefit of making Deziree's break-in all the easier, as well as being able to see perfectly in the dark. Looking through the lab, she spotted the wall behind which the plant was sealed. Deziree willed it transparent, allowing her to see the superpower-granting alien plant as if hidden behind transparent glass instead of solid steel.

"Wow," she whispered in admiration. Her impromptu test proved that she was able to see through walls just fine, even spotting the secret vault where she had sent the containers with the plants liquid earlier. Those were the reason she had come here tonight. After the Susan had promptly drunk a large amount of this stuff only to leak her milk in the process and the Angel taking with her the rest of that container, there was no doubt that this stuff was what gave them super powers. But how to get it? Sure she could use her access codes to get it out, but any access was logged and thus traceable to her. Apparently she would have to use force and rip open the underground vault.

She chuckled. Ripping open a high security vault? God, that sounded crazy, but then again so did the idea that a woman could fly through the sky and lift a freaking plane. The vault should be feasible for her. In fact, it was the best way to test out how strong she really was. So much for sneaky, she thought.

Traveling to the level below her lab didn't present any challenge now. With her newly found X-ray vision Deziree was now able to spot the guards through the walls - and there were none in her way anyway. A few minutes later she was standing in front of the vault door. Noticing a security camera above it, she stared at it intently as it was impossible for her to open the vault without getting filmed, even though she herself was invisible. She felt some of the super energy enter her eyes and… boom… two beams of green light had shot out of them and destroyed the camera.

"Oh my god," she shouted out, as she saw the destruction her eyes could cause. She would need to be extra careful with her new powers, that was for sure. Still, the vault door was closed and waited for her to test her strength on it. Touching down on the floor, Deziree walked towards the door and put her hands around it. The thick steel felt just as immovable as she had expected it to be, but Deziree convinced herself that she could do that. As she applied more pressure, she could feel the energy inside her moving into her muscles boosting her strength to levels she had yet to figure out.

Deziree took her time, the scientist part of her curious to find out what exactly her body was doing right now. She found herself strangely aware about her increasing strength and could feel that there was a lot of muscle tissue that seemed inactive. Remembering earlier today, Deziree recalled the effect the overdose of the potion had on Susan. The other woman had seemed to grow a lot more muscular before shrinking down to normal again.

As she thought about that, Deziree wondered if she could grow to these kind of proportions as well - and her body responded in kind. The young botanist could feel a wave of super energy going into the dormant muscle cells all over her body and instantly felt herself grow to bodybuilder-like proportions. From one moment to the next she went from slowly applying pressure onto the thick vault door to using all the strength her body could muster.

Boom

The sudden noise caught Deziree off-guard and it took her enhanced mind a whole three seconds to process what had happened. Her hands, slender as they were had ripped through the solid steel door like it was made of paper. Instead of just forcing the door open, she had torn it to shreds. This was a vault door created to withstand the explosive force of pretty much everything short of a nuclear warhead. And she had simply ripped it apart as if it were made of paper.

Awestruck by the raw power she had displayed just now, Deziree proceeded to create an opening large enough for her to get through. Now better controlling her strength, she was rewarded with a screeching sound as the steel protested uselessly against the force she applied to bend it. A few seconds later the door had been deformed beyond repair and Deziree allowed herself to relax again, feeling her body shrinking down a bit as the extra muscles turned inactive again.

She marveled at her handiwork. A solid vault door hadn't even proven any resistance to her. Deziree quickly spotted the two containers she had managed to secure this afternoon. With the vault door gone she could see the faint glow of the power inside it, but she was actually surprised to see how faint it was. Apparently the sturdy container made it harder for her to spot the otherwise invisible energy. Activating her X-ray vision she could see the liquid inside it but the super energy itself wasn't visible anymore. This meant that while supers like her could see the super energy, not even their X-ray vision would allow them to see it through the walls. So while the vault wouldn't have slowed down a possible intruder, it did a good job at hiding the stuff.

Picking up the large containers, Deziree found it rather easy not to use too much force while holding them. She also remembered that these containers were heavy enough for her to struggle with them when she was still normal. Now that she had what she came for, Deziree turned around and back through the vault door she had opened.

"Freeze!" came a shout from the front. Apparently Deziree had forgotten about the silent alarm that would go off when the vault was damaged. Or maybe the destroyed camera had caught some attention. Whatever it was, one of the guards she had avoided before, was standing there and pointed a gun at her.

Deziree's first reaction was a slight hint of panic and she did as told. She had been so absorbed in her feats of strength that she didn't notice that she had become visible. The gun wouldn't be much of a threat to her, but her plan of going in and out unnoticed had failed.

"Put down those containers!" the man ordered.

More out of habit than out of genuine fear, Deziree dropped the two containers and with a loud clang they landed on the ground.

"What the?" the guard was obviously surprised. Dezire figured that he must've expected them to be much lighter judging by the way she had carried them.

"Ok, who are you?" he asked again, his voice a little shaky.

That was a surprise, Deziree hadn't expected to be this intimidating, but she could already see the sweat forming on his forehead, his eyes wandering nervously over her, and his aim wasn't exactly steady either. Still, the way he eyed her...

Deziree blushed as she realized the true reason for his unease. He wasn't scared of her at all. The tent in his pants was a clear sign that he liked what he saw. Her blush became even more intense as she remembered her own nakedness. This man didn't even need her superpowered pheromones to affect him in order to get horny. And he wasn't exactly unattractive.

"I'd rather not say my name," Deziree answered. "And as you can see I don't have an ID with me."

She could clearly hear the man's heartbeat begin to pick up the pace, his eyes wandering over her body with ever increasing lust. Deziree didn't know whether or not she liked that. In fact this was the first time she ever got that kind of attention from a man. And given that she had become super specifically in order to finally be noticed by the other gender, this was should make her happy beyond reason. On the other hand, her being naked right now embarrassed her to no end. She had only stayed naked because she was invisible, something that wouldn't apply to anything she touched. Not that she had fitting clothes anyway.

"You don't seem to have anything with you..." the man stated the obvious."H-how did you manage to open the vault?" He looked at the shredded remains of the massive door and gulped. "What the hell happened here?" he whispered, obviously expecting her not to hear that.

"Well, I ripped it open with my bare hands," Deziree said shyly. She was fully aware of how ridiculous that sounded.

The man gulped again and his hand almost began shaking. Apparently he believed her. This wasn't that strange considering he had been patroling a facility that still showed the damage of the fight the Angel and Susan had here. He had little reason to doubt the existence of a woman that could rip open a massive vault, after all.

"Y-you're not kidding, right?"

Deziree shook her head.

"Then what are you here for?" the man asked again. "W-what is in these containers that you come here?"

Now those were dangerous questions. Deziree was pretty sure he had figured out that the containers included the reason for her super powers. The look on his face remained lustful, but it also showed … greed?

"A woman has to keep her secrets, right?" She weakly answered.

"I bet it's what gave you these powers, right?" He lowered the gun, and began walking towards her. "Why else would you come here and break into a vault that is meant to hold dangerous materials?"

"And what if it were?" Deziree was getting nervous now. Something about the way he acted rubbed her the wrong way.

"Why the angry face," he smoothly said. He came closer, his hands reaching up to her face. "A beautiful woman like you looks much better when she smiles."

"Don't touch me!" Deziree said and at the same time felt a strange sensation in her eyes.

He immediately complied.

This surprised Deziree, but then she remembered her own encounter with Susan this afternoon. The other woman had shown some kind of mind control ability and it just sounded logical that she could do that was well. Now this was convenient. This way, she could ask him and he would have to answer honestly and not even remember it.

"Now tell me, what would you do if these containers actually did contain the source of these powers?" Deziree asked, her green eyes glowing even more than normal as she spoke. She was getting the hang on how this worked.

"I would talk you into sharing it with me, then sleep with you, having you show me how things worked. Then when you wouldn't be looking I would steal the containers from you."

Deziree's eyes widened. This guy must've been rotten to the core to even consider this. He intended to use her like a tool. And she wouldn't have it. "You will forget that I was here and what I took from the vault. You will have no desire of gaining this kind of power, and you will do anything to prevent yourself from getting them. Furthermore you won't hurt people unless it's in self-defense. This also includes other people's feelings, do you understand?"

The man nodded, and Deziree was confident that her commands had been deeply implanted into his brain. He turned around and walked away, whistling as if he was still patrolling, utterly ignoring the naked superwoman.

"Unbelievable," Deziree whispered. The human mind was basically just a plaything. With this kind of power Susan could have done a lot more damage if she intended to. Deziree was just happy that the other women hadn't done so. Picking up the two containers she made her way out of the lab as quickly as possible.

 

 

Once she was back flying high over the city, Deziree pondered the situation. The way the guard had acted had been quite disturbing. And the fact that he had seen her naked definitely wasn't part of the plan. Then again it was her own fault for counting on her invisibility alone and then forget to keep it up all time. She tried it again, her body becoming transparent but still visible to her own eyes. The containers however were unaffected, so for a normal person it would seem like they hovered in the air. Any super powered person, however would probably still be able to spot her as the glow of her super energy remained.

Deziree wondered how she could prevent such an embarrassing moment in the future. Thinking back to this afternoon, Susan had clearly used some thrown together clothes to hold her improved curves and these clothes had not survived the battle. The Angel however had only worn a leotard that hat remained in perfect shape throughout the battle. What the hell had this been made of? Then she remembered the bandage the Angel had created for her...

Oh god it was so obvious! Deziree wanted to kick herself for not thinking about this sooner. The Angel had willed these clothes into existence! Trying it out herself imagined herself in an elegant red dress that was long, yet showed of her amazing legs with through a slit. Sure enough she felt a tingling all over her body and the dress simply grew out of her. It didn't even take a second and she was wearing the very dress she had imagined. But also she felt the strain that this had caused.

"Nice dress," a voice suddenly spoke behind her.
