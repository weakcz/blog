Deziree turned around to spot a woman hovering there. She wore a black catsuit with red and orange flames on it that seemed to flow straight into the boots she wore. 
<!--more-->
That outfit only enhanced the long red hair and the glowing orange eyes as well as the proportions that were almost identical to Deziree's own. If she had to describe this woman with one word, it would definitely be 'hot'.

"Uhm...thanks," Deziree answered shyly. From what she had heard about this woman, she had hospitalized a man she had encountered. The good news was that the victim claimed it to be an accident. But Deziree had no way of knowing if that was true, so she kept her guard up. After all, the other woman could probably see what was inside the containers. Unfortunately the redhead seemed to have more of the super energy inside her than Deziree did right now.

"No need to belittle yourself," the other woman said with a slightly warmer voice. "This is the fanciest dress I've seen that was created this way. It shows that you have a certain talent. Say, what should I call you?"

"I'd rather keep my name a secret," Deziree answered immediately. After her encounter with the guard just now, she found it hard to believe this woman's friendly voice...not while she carried something with her that the other woman probably wanted.

"I didn't ask for your real name, did I? By the way, you can call me Devil."

"Not exactly the friendliest name there is. But it kinda fits." Now Deziree tried to figure out a name she could give in return. She hadn't really thought about a codename of the likes of Angel or Devil and actually wondered if the former had done such a thing. The media obviously named her because of the wings she had materialized to carry the plane after all. "I can't really think of a name right now," she admitted.

"Hm?" The redhead raised her brow. "Well, it's not that important actually. But I'd like to ask you a few other questions. Would you answer them?"

"That depends on the question." Deziree was still on the fence about this woman. She was nice and polite, but maybe that was only because she thought she had the upper hand? Then again this was an opportunity to get some answers herself. "Actually, I also have some questions about you. How about we take turns?"

"Fair enough. You can start if you want."

Now this was a surprise. The redhead let her start? Deziree hoped that this wasn't just a trick to make her trust the other woman. After the rotten guard, she could really use someone to restore her faith in humanity. "How did you get these powers?"

The redhead sighed. "Straight to the chase, huh? Well since I'm going to ask you the same it's only fair, I guess. My best friend got her hands on some of the stuff that's probably in those containers you carry and shared it with me."

"How did she get it?" Deziree asked.

"Wait, first you'll have to answer me my question. How did you get these powers?"

Deziree sighed. "Some superpowered bitch tried to kill me, got her hands on one of these containers, drank a great deal of it, and started leaking milk. The Angel interfered, kicked the bitches' ass while I managed to sneak some of the milk away, and you can guess the rest."

Devil's orange eyes widened. "Interesting. Your turn again."

"How did your friend get this stuff? Did she have another person who gave it to her? Or does she have a plant that produces it?"

"She's got her own plant. So the milk you drank came from another super? Where did her powers come from? These containers, or somewhere else?"

Deziree shrugged. "I don't know. She seemed unaware of the stuffs effects until she drank it, but I can't rule out that she got her powers through this."

"Understandable. Well, your turn again."

"Is your best friend the Angel?"

For a second, Devil glared at her, but her expression softened right away. "Guess there's no use hiding it: Yes. My turn again: Where did those containers come from?"

"I … uhm kinda stole them." Deziree admitted sheepishly. "And if the Angel is really your best friend she knows from where." Or who I am, she thought to herself. "What kinds of abilities do we all possess? It's kind of a hassle figuring everything out myself."

"Well," Devil hesitated. "The whole thing is a bit more complicated. From what I understand there's some basic abilities we gained through drinking the potion. From what I understand abilities like flight, invulnerability, energy-absorption and the ability to create this cloth-like material come straight from the plant that produced the potion, while other abilities like super strength, super senses, X-ray vision and super pheromones are basically just enhancements of normal human abilities. Anything else seems kind of individual."

"What do you mean by that?"

Devil looked at her, unsure about whether or not to protest about this follow-up question. She decided to answer instead. "From what I understand we can use the aforementioned powers on an instinctive level, but it is also possible to figure out other abilities for yourself. And you can actually share these abilities with other supers by absorbing their super energy, so they're not really exclusive although they seem to be affected by one's personality."

Deziree's eyes widened.

"Alright, my turn: What power that I didn't mention do you possess?" Devil continued.

"Uhm," Deziree pondered her answer. While invisibility would be the honest answer, she actually had some choices here. She had at least three abilities that wouldn't be among the standard set Devil had mentioned. The question was which one was hers? Well, mind control was obviously Susan's trick. That woman was so accustomed of getting what she wanted, that this power fit her far too well. That left heat vision and invisibility. And it was just as obvious that the latter fit for plain, shy unnoticeable Deziree.

"I can shoot lasers out of my eyes," Deziree answered.

Devil's face could barely contain her surprise. "First the dress and now that," she muttered to herself. "What else?"

"What makes you think there is more?" Deziree countered, wondering what that had to do with her dress.

Instead of answering, Devil held up her arm, looked at it and suddenly fired two beams of light onto it – beams that didn't hurt her in the least. "Heat vision is kind of my thing. And actually your dress is too fancy for it to be created with the basic fabric creation, so I think you got an enhancement on that just like I did. It probably won't even disappear once you transform back."

"Y-you said that these powers can be shared quite easily," Deziree stammered, her mind racing. She remembered how she had absorbed the energy from the bandage the Angel had given her. Apparently she had gotten all the Angel's abilities along with it. "So you gave the Angel your powers…"

"Indeed. And apparently she gave them to you in turn," Devil concluded.

Deziree let out a sigh of relief. This confirmed that Devil was indeed a friend of the Angel. After the guard that had tried to lie to her before, it mean a lot that this woman spoke the truth. Then it hit her: She had absorbed the Angels powers... the same Angel that had easily defeated Susan earlier today.

"Wow... I didn't look at it this way," she exclaimed.

"So, what extra powers do you have?" Devil repeated.

"Well, I can turn invisible," Deziree admitted, before remembering that Devil would probably learn about Susan's ability if she asked the Angel. "And I kinda have mind control powers."

"Mind control?" Devil seemed intrigued. "That's sounds dangerous."

"Yeah," Deziree nodded. "It's from the woman whose milk I drank and... let's just say she didn't notice what she was actually capable of. Thank goodness...she wasn't exactly subtle. Who knows what she could have done without anybody to stop her."

Devil nodded, and after a moment of silence she added. "Your turn."

This brought Deziree back to their asking game. She had a lot of questions, but right now it was hard for her to figure out the right one. "Uhm, why did you approach me instead of... y'know grab those containers or something like that?"

"Hm," Devil took some time to prepare the right words. "In my experience it's a lot more constructive to talk to one another instead of showing hostility. After all, you probably wouldn't want to answer my questions if I attacked you out of the blue. And these containers...if they got damaged in the struggle the contents would rain upon the city. I can't even imagine the damage that could cause."

There was no arguing with that.

"My turn," Devil continued. "Since you had the choice to become super, why did you drink that milk? What exactly are your goals?"

As simple as it sounded, as embarrassing was the answer. Deziree blushed as she thought about her original reasons behind drinking this potion. She hadn't done that for the ability to rip open a vault door with her bare hands or the ability to bend other's minds to her will.

"I … uhm kinda did it for the looks," she almost whispered.

Devil raised her eyebrow. Given that they were hovering high over the city, the wind would usually make it impossible for her to hear Deziree, but her super hearing made up for that.

"I mean, well...I looked rather plain before I took it and... when I encountered these women today, not only the Angel, but the one who attacked me as well. They just make you want to be like them, in a way."

"Yeah, I know that feeling," Devil nodded. "But now that you have these looks, what are you gonna do with them? Especially since you got yourself quite the supply of them."

She gestured at the containers that Deziree was still holding. Normally she would have struggled to carry even one of them, but right now the two had felt so light to her that she had almost forgotten about them. Then again, their valuable contents had kept them in the back of her head.

Her mind darted back and forth. Deziree hadn't planned ahead that far. Getting a large enough supply had been the natural thing to do - and the chaos at the lab had made it easier for her to get that. But aside from that...

"You haven't thought that far, have you?" Devil eventually spoke it out.

Deziree let her head hang low in defeat. "It was a spontaneous decision."

"Don't beat yourself up because of that. It was even worse for me," the redhead cheered her up. "I was heartbroken and my best friend had entrusted some of the potion to me. When I got sick on top of that I couldn't resist any longer."

Raising her head again, Deziree managed to fill in the blanks. She had heard about Devil's encounter with Mr. Riley, but since that wasn't as well known as the Angel, she couldn't mention it right now. What's more, she knew that this guy had an affair with Susan Harland of all people. The same woman who had intended to kill Deziree for no reason at all.

"Well, I guess we all make mistakes," she commented. "What exactly are you planning to do with your abilities?"

"If you asked me a week ago I would have said 'become a superheroine, of course' but now this doesn't seem too smart. That spot is occupied by Angel, after all, and stepping into the spotlight would only make it harder for her. For now I'm trying to get my life back on track and since I always wanted to be a doctor, I thought maybe I, with all these outrageous powers, I might somehow develop actual healing powers. Of course...that's a work in progress."

"That sounds quite ambitious," Deziree concluded. "But an honorable goal nonetheless."

"There are some personal reasons behind that, too. I'm trying to solve a tricky problem with these powers and actually..." she averted her eyes as she sheepishly finished the sentence. "I could really use some of the stuff from these containers for that."

Deziree gulped as she heard that. "W-what do you mean, I thought the Angel shared her supply with you?"

"Yeah she does, but it's kinda important for it to be of a different source than the one she has. You know the stuff changed our genes, and two people who took the potion from the same source would be like siblings. This might work with good friends, but for the partner... it's pretty much incestuous. A potion from another source however would mean that the changes were slightly different - no incest there."

No, thought Desiree, that actually made sense. "So that explains why the Angel took the remainder of the third container with her."

Devil looked at her, surprised, but nodded eventually. "Well, in that case she might be having the time of her life right now."

 

 

"Dammit!" Michelle screamed as her fist slammed into the boulder. The giant rock crumbled under the force, and with a loud boom shattered into thousands of tiny pieces that flew in every possible direction.

The young woman looked around. By now she had turned a large part of the mountain front into a number of small stones. Any mining company would be proud of that, but for her it was merely a way to vent her frustration. In her mind she replayed her last conversation with James, which hadn't gone entirely as planned. Now that she had found an alternative power source for him, she had intended for him to take it only for him to decline out of fear for the consequences. Unfortunately she couldn't take that away from him. There was at least one person who died because she had taken the potion - so it was hard to argue with that no matter how convinced she was that everything would be alright. Then there had been the part about her wanting to get knocked up by him. Michelle knew that from an instinctive part this made sense - and that may actually be a subconscious reason for her. But still, she didn't want to admit to herself that her wishes and desires all boiled down to a wish to procreate.

Focusing the super energy in her eyes, two beams of blue light shot out of them and cut another boulder from the mountain. The rock fell towards her only for another punch of hers to shatter it just like the one before. Michelle had always wondered what she should use her destructive powers for, and now she had the answer: Nothing helped her vent her own anger better than senseless destruction. In the last five minutes she had caused more destruction than in her entire life before that. Fortunately, nobody would mourn the mountain she disfigured. There was nobody in the vicinity anyway.

Eventually, however she got bored with that. As much a stress reliever it was, the whole thing didn't bring her any closer to a solution. To find that, she would need to talk to someone and get a third opinion. Rising up from the mountain, she instantly accelerated to make her way back home. Compared to last night, Michelle's flight speed had significantly improved. The whole exertion with the plane had worked wonders on that front. Using all her cells to fly now seemed so easy, as if it had become a part of her. From the mountain in Africa to her hometown in the US it took a mere ten minutes - and she wasn't even going full speed yet. She probably could fly around the world in twenty minutes instead of the almost full hour she had needed yesterday.

Once she was back in familiar airspace, she quickly scanned Amanda's apartment - only to see Amanda wasn't there. Michelle let out a disappointed frown. Amanda was the only other person that knew about her powers. Who else could she talk to about such a matter?

 

 

It took Amanda a while to get used to the smell in the bar. This was the first time she had visited in her super form and her enhanced senses were picking up more different scents than she was comfortable with. Next to her, Desire had struggled with the same problems. The decision to move their conversation from the skyline to a more hospitable place had more or less forced the other woman to come up with a codename and this had been it. Amanda didn't think that Desire described the other woman well, though. Compared to any normal woman, she surely was a living fantasy, but compared to other supers like herself she didn't stick ut that much. Their physiques were so similar that it was a matter of personal taste after all. Still, she didn't complain about the name, especially since Desire had actually agreed to share a whole container of the super potion with Amanda. That was much more than she needed, and she definitely appreciated the gesture.

The two superwomen had changed their outfits into something more fitting for the occasion, but that didn't mean they didn't draw any attention. On the contrary, given the stares they were receiving, Amanda doubted that her Devil costume would have drawn any more attention than she had now. Desire smiled and blushed at all these eyes that were aimed at her. Amanda had the feeling that Desire enjoyed this quite a lot. Maybe the name wasn't that far off after all. They chose a hidden corner booth for themselves.

"So what exactly are you doing at that research institute?" Amanda resumed their conversation.

"Funny thing: I'm a botanist." Desire continued, "I had that stuff right in front of my nose for the last few months and had no idea what it was capable of."

That surprised Amanda less than expected. Michelle and her had already theorized that the plant was alien and it made sense that there was more than one seed inside the meteor. Of course it would have been found.

"I can see that. Drinking some alien plant juice isn't exactly a valid form of examination."

"Oh it would have been one hell of a surprise," Desire chuckled. "But I'm glad that it happened in my own apartment, I couldn't stand the idea of being filmed when it happened."

She blushed. Amanda could all to well understand why she did so. Even though the first transformation started as a rough ride, it did finish as a really pleasurable one.

"Uhm, there's one question I am particularly interested in..." Desire blushed even further. Amanda wouldn't be surprised if the other woman suddenly started glowing bright red if she got any more embarrassed. Stranger things had happened.

"Shoot it."

"Well..." her voice became a whisper. "Is it actually possible for us to have s-sex with normal men?"

Amanda could barely prevent herself from laughing. "Of course it is," she said before adding with a smile. "And it feels awesome!"

Desire's eyes grew wide as her lips curled to a smile. Amanda could even see that the other woman rose into the air - probably involuntarily.

"Keep it together," she whispered. "We're in public, after all."

Blushing again, Desire sank back onto her seat. "Sorry, I'm new to that." A quick glance revealed that her little trip to the air had gone unnoticed. "All clear it seems."

"Back to your job. You said you examined the plant, did you find anything out of the ordinary besides this liquid?"

Desire thought a bit. "Well, I wouldn't call it out of the ordinary since it's an alien life form. The similarity to local plant life is quite striking. Oh, and it's quite tough. We tried to cut off a leaf for sampling, but no matter what we tried, we couldn't do it. Until yesterday I had no idea how to explain it, but after seeing the Angel carrying the plane this morning, I immediately had a feeling that this could be connected."

Amanda was about to comment, when a waitress arrived at the table. To her surprise she already brought two beers and put them on their table.

"From the two young men at the bar," she announced and pointed to towards them.

The two men in question were admittedly handsome and seemed to have the money to spare. Their cheeky grins basically claimed "We're the best you can get here" and Amanda didn't stand this kind of arrogance. Desire however returned the smile.

"Which one do you want?" she asked.

"My fiancé," Amanda answered right away. "Not one of these guys."

"Oh? I thought you were heartbroken before you took the potion?"

Amanda bit her lip, this topic was quite close to unmasking her.

"Let's just say it worked out somehow," she commented, hoping to end the topic quickly.

"Come to think of it, didn't you deliver a guy to the hospital a few days ago? Had that anything to do with it?"

Now Amanda was getting nervous. The other woman knew a lot more than she expected. "Uhm, well..." she stammered. "I don't want to talk about that."

"Oh come on," the brunette urged. "If that was an accident, you could tell me how it happened. After all something similar could happen with me as well. You also all but know who I am anyway. All you have to do is ask your friend and she'll be able to identify me."

Amanda let out a sigh. Desire had a point. "Ok, I'll admit it. He was my ex-boyfriend at the time. It's complicated. He had cheated on me, so I dumped him. And I took the potion right after he had fetched his stuff from my place. I went for a flight through the city and found myself at his place as he was about to arrive. Given that I looked radically different I wanted to use that as I flirted with him a bit."

"I take it he was like wax in your hands?"

"Actually he wasn't. On the contrary he was more affected by the breakup than I expected. Unfortunately I didn't realize that and kicked his car to bits and then took him for a quick flight - too bad his shirt couldn't carry his weight."

"Ouch... hard to believe that this still worked out in the end."

"Well, it's a bit complicated. There were circumstances behind his cheating, stuff that I hadn't known before and that allowed me to make an exception for him."

Desire listened intently and nodded. "So you didn't know about his condition? I mean a terminal sickness isn't a small deal."

Amanda's eyes widened. "H-how did you know that?"

"Well, I've had the questionable honor of playing babysitter for the woman your ex had an affair with. Let's just say every encounter got worse - until she tried to kill me today."

"What?" Amanda almost crushed her drink as she heard that. "That Harland bitch is super?"

"Not anymore. She may still look like it, but her powers were gone when the Angel was done with her."

"I don't understand. She still looked super even when she was out of energy?"

"Yes. Is that strange? I thought people would turn back to normal once out of power, but after seeing that I imagined that I'd get to keep these," Desire pointed at her chest.

Shaking her head Amanda tried to figure this out. "No, we usually transform back to normal. Well not really, we still look better than before but can still be recognized as our original selves. It would be the first time I heard about someone looking super even after being out of energy."

"Interesting," Desire commented. "So despite our deep-rooted changes into half-alien hybrids, we still look perfectly human when we run out of energy? This sounds a bit like that is supposed to conserve said energy."

"Indeed. And in the long run it should be possible for us to absorb sunlight to produce the super energy ourselves."

Now Desire seemed surprised. "That doesn't make much sense strictly speaking. The amount of energy in the sunlight is far too low to allow any of the stuff we can do. Especially compared to the amount of liquid the plant can produce."

"You may have a point there, but I can definitely feel how the sunlight gets absorbed and turned into super energy - even though it's not much. If anything it is a catalyst the plants and our bodies need to produce super energy. Right now we're rather bad at it which explains why we deplete our supply. At one point however, we'll be producing more than we use up."

"Oh god that's it!" Desire exclaimed. "I know why Susan didn't transform back to normal! She had drunk so much of the potion at once that she reached the maximum she could store. That's why she lactated the excess energy as an own potion. For her body this must've been a sign that she didn't need the 'low power' state anymore."

"So all it needs is drinking enough potion and we'd be stuck like this?" Amanda whispered. Part of her liked the double identity she could have as her normal self and Devil. As good as it felt to be Devil, she had a normal life that she could live. How would that affect her life with Fred if that happened? Her eyes widened. She had spent hours looking through her medical books to figure out a way to cure his Harland Syndrome and how the potion had proven fatal for Erika. Could this be the solution?

"You don't look like that's a bad thing..." Desire commented.

"Well I just had an idea. But I would need some information first. You see the potion proved deadly for someone with Harland Syndrome, and I need to verify the cause of death. If it's the transformation back to normal, then the whole not transforming back part could be the solution to curing the Harland Syndrome."

"Haha that would be it," Desire chuckled. "For Susan Harland to find the cure her father searched his whole life, it sounds a bit ironic. But for the cause of death I suggest you ask the one doing the autopsy." And with a nod towards the door she added. "And it seems like you're lucky."

 

 

Jacob suppressed a yawn as they entered the bar. He had spent the last nights in bars hoping to find any clue on the superwomen that had appeared. Monday night he might have encountered a male version of these, but he had faced into the wrong direction. Last night on his way home he had been lucky to encounter the Angel. That was about it in terms of success and given today's events he had looked forward to an evening of peace and quiet.

Apparently James had thought otherwise. That in itself was a new development. Outside of work the two had never hung out and from the tone of him when he called, James had something on his mind that he wanted to drown in alcohol.

"Two beers," James ordered the first round.

"So..." Jacob said after a while of awkward silence. "What made you decide to go for a drink tonight?"

"Isn't it obvious? A woman!" James said grudgingly.

"That would be 'who' made you decide to go for a drink. I was asking for the actual story." Jacob countered.

"Let's just say my girlfriend moves pretty fast in certain things."

"Did she ask you to move in already?" Jacobe asked half-seriously.

James shook his head. "No, it's a bit more complicated than that."

"I assume that it has something to do with a certain blonde goddess who likes bullet-massages and uses planes for a workout."

Now James seemed shocked. "What?"

"Well, you told me she's a reporter, so I thought she might have expected you to give out some classified information to her."

James shook his head. "No, she's not like that."

Now this was a surprise.

"Are you telling me that you're dating a reporter that doesn't want you to talk about the news of the day, not to mention the week, month and most likely year?"

"That's not what I meant. I mean that she wouldn't use that information for her career."

This sounded fishy to Jacob. "Sounds like you're readily trusting here."

James burst into laughter. "To you it may seem that way, but trust me: Compared to her I am very skeptical."

"Well...I have to take your word on that. After all, I've never met her." He took a sip from his beer. "So what did she rush about?"

"It's a private matter, sorry."

"Freaky ideas for the bedroom, huh? Or did she stop using protection?"

"Something along those lines, so let's switch the topic." James said sourly as he took a sip from his beer.

"Alright, new topic then. What do you think it would be like to bang the Angel?"

James almost spat out his beer. "What the hell?" He said in between coughs. "Why did you come up with that topic?"

Jacob laughed at this reaction. "Right now, the look on your face would be reason enough. And besides work we didn't have many topics."

"Maybe. But after today, does it really have to be this one?"

"Hey! At least you got through all that without a scratch. And you were the only one to do so. God I was tempted to return the favor to that bitch."

"So you questioned her?"

"Yeah, she wasn't very informative, though. Didn't know how she ended up that way. From her point of view these powers were an STD."

"We have hints that claim otherwise," James countered dryly.

"True. Actually, I think that strange liquid was somehow slipped to her. From Ms. Harland's description it looks like her partner was super too. Given what we know, he would have to make her super in order to sleep with her."

"Uh-huh." James didn't sound too interested. "Well maybe it was less a necessity but more of a personal preference. Assuming he's behind the drug addict and Ms. Riley, neither of them were in perfect health after all."

"The Asian too, she was in a wheelchair after all." Jacob added. "I'm sensing a pattern here. Some guy picking out women with health problems, giving them the potion which causes them to become both healthy and attractive. Then he sleeps with them and leaves them on their own. In some cases they could roam the city - like the redhead, the Asian and Ms. Harland - while in other cases the health problems came back with a vengeance."

"I don't like that." James took another sip. "Giving them power, changing their genes and then leaving them unguided. Seems like he doesn't care for the consequences at all."

"He probably thought he was doing them a favor. After all, he outright encouraged Ms. Harland to have fun with her powers."

"If destroying a lab and trying to kill people for the hell of it was his definition of fun, then we have an even bigger problem than him creating mutants left and right."

"Well, for today at least we've seen enough of them," Jacob tried to end the topic.

James turned to him, but then his gaze went past him and into a corner of the bar. Letting out another sigh, he focused back on his beer. "Corner booth at eight o'clock, two women," he said.

"Was that fight of yours really bad enough to be looking at other women already?" Jacob asked.

"Just look!"

And Jacob did as he was told. What he saw made his heart drop. With her backside faced towards him, there was a redhead. So far so unimpressive. But the other woman was an outright hot brunette whose green eyes showed a glow he had seen before. There was no doubt that this beauty was just as super as the Angel or Ms. Harland had been. And her eyes were fixed on his to boot. Before he could even wonder if the redhead was super as well, she turned around to reveal glowing orange orbs that instantly locked onto him as well. Her lips curled into a smile as she waved them over.

"Looks like they noticed us too," he commented.

 

 

"Hello?" the familiar voice came through the phone.

"Hi JJ, it's me," Michelle said like she always did.

"M-Michelle?"

"Who else?"

"Well," JJ paused. "it's your number on the display, but your voice sounds so different that I wouldn't recognize it."

Michelle bit her lip. She was still in her super form and had totally forgotten that her voice was different compared to her normal form. Not wanting to explain the changes she had gone through was the reason she was calling JJ instead of flying the five hundred miles to drop by.

"Oh that, I have some trouble with my phone so my voice comes over a bit weird," she lied. "But I can hear you just fine and so far nobody complained about the way I sound over the phone sometimes."

"I wouldn't say it sounds bad either, but it's strange not to hear my sister's familiar voice. Maybe you should get a new phone?" JJ suggested.

"I'll consider it, but that's not why I called. I've had a fight with my boyfriend and I'd like to hear your opinion on it."

A few seconds of silence followed.

"I didn't even know you were seeing someone," JJ commented. "But go ahead."

"Well, this may be a bit hard to follow, but I found something that would do wonders for his health, but he refuses to do it."

"Is he sick or something?"

"No, he's actually in good
health."

Another moment of silence before JJ answered. "If he's in good health, how do you plan to improve it?"

"As I said it's complicated. But I would really want him to go through with it, how can I convince him?"

"Sis, I have no idea what you're talking about here. All I can say is if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it. He probably has his reasons why he doesn't want to."

"But those reasons are far-fetched, if not plain wrong. It worked for me just great. And if he did it, it would take our relationship to a whole new level."

"How long have you known each other again?"

Michelle bit her lip. "Sunday," she admitted. "But it feels like I've known him for my entire life. I know it's hard to understand, but that's how it is."

"I can't claim to know the guy, but from what I've heard you should stop forcing the issue. You've been dating for half a week, so whatever it is you want from him, it's too soon. Right now you're rushing things. Give it more time, maybe he'll warm up to the idea later. It has to be his own choice."

"But... I didn't get to choose either!" Michelle blurted out before she knew what she said.

"Sis..." JJ's voice was calm and serious, something Michelle rarely heard. "What are we talking about here? I'd like to help you but you have to tell me what's going on."

"You... wouldn't believe me even if I told you."

"Have you been paying attention to the news today? Ah who am I kidding, of course you have. After seeing news about a superheroine there's nothing that could be too far-fetched anymore. And you know you can trust me with anything."

Michelle pondered her options. It was obvious that JJ wouldn't be able to give helpful advice with this level of information. On the other hand Michelle wasn't prepared to tell her family about her condition. Then again she had practically told James after little more than a day.

"You know what, you're right. But this is more face-to-face news."

"We're over five hundred miles apart. Unless you plan to stop by in the near future, I think it can be excused to tell me over the phone."

"Then I'll just have to come over."

"Tonight? It's the middle of the week, you know?"

"I'm fast!"

"Not that fast," JJ countered weakly.

"We'll see about that," Michelle said right before she hung up. Continuing this argument would only spoil the moment of surprise. "Five hundred miles," she said aloud as she hovered over to the balcony door. "Won't even take me five minutes!"

 

 

Deziree was beside herself. The encounter with Devil had started of quite scary, but by now, the situation had turned out quite well. Both superwomen had used their super hearing to eavesdrop on Dr. Thompson and Det. Spencer and the conversation had been interesting to say the least. Now that the men had noticed them, they were on their way towards them. She was almost bursting with anticipation. Her whole life she had been the unimpressive one, the girl nobody noticed. And now? Now there was a bar full of guys that would die to talk to her. And these two were the only ones who had done so before. Granted, Dr. Thompson had rejected her advances earlier, but he hadn't lied about his girlfriend at least. Deziree wasn't sure whether or not to be happy about his trouble with her, though.

Her focus, however, was on Jacob. Not only had they survived the encounter with Susan together, but he had also asked her out on a date. Using her X-ray vision to check out the wounds he had suffered today, she soon caught herself using it for less medical purposes. With her sight returning to normal, she composed herself right on time before Jacob spoke.

"Good evening ladies, mind if we join you?" he asked with a hint of nervousness. Unlike all other men in the bar, these two knew full well what they were dealing with here. Given what had happened with Susan this almost counted as brave.

"Sure, we could always use some company," Devil flirtingly answered.

The two men sat down, Jacob next to Devil and James next to Deziree. Why couldn't it be the other way around? She wondered.

"This is Dr. James Thompson, and my name is Jacob Spencer."

"We're a bit picky about telling our names. You can call me Devil, and her …"

"D-Desire," Deziree stammered. Both men looked at each other and shrugged.

"So what were you girls talking about?" Jacob continued.

"Oh you know, the usual stuff. Diet, fitness and fashion."

James chuckled in a mocking manner.

"Well, I'm not exactly a fashion freak," Jacob answered. "But I'd like to hear about the other two, right James?"

James only nodded about that. "Yeah, especially the diet sounds interesting." The sarcasm was hard to miss.

"Let's just say it's all only natural products." Devil teased.

Deziree immediately notices a hint of fear on Jacobs face. Even though Devil had remained calm and was playful and friendly, the cop couldn't totally shake the fact that his last encounter with a superwoman had been less than pleasant.

"Don't worry, we won't bite," she assured him.

Jacob looked at her quizzically. Apparently he had assumed that his nervousness would remain hidden behind the poker face he had set up.

"And where would you get these natural products?" he asked with feigned innocence.

Deziree didn't like that he was only addressing Devil here. Granted she was a lot more knowledgeable than she was, but he didn't know that, did he?

"You just have to know the right sources," Devil teased further.

Jacob sighted. "How about we stop fooling aroung? Ok, how did you get the stuff that turned you into what you are now?"

"It was a present from a friend," Devil answered, her smile not even disappearing for a second. "And I think you have heard about her."

Jacob nodded. "Well, I'd like to talk to you about Fred Riley."

Deziree began to feel uncomfortable. From the corner of her eye she saw that James eyed her skeptically while Jacob was utterly fixated on Devil. What really bothered her was the growing amount of nervousness he tried to hide - not to mention the tricky topic he was bringing up.

"What about him?"

"Your encounter with him wasn't exactly good for his health, so I wondered why you met him in the first place. Shortly before your friend saved his sisters life."

"As suspicious as it may sound, it was just a coincidence. After all, Ms. Riley was a hostage in a bank robbery, so it should be clear why my friend interfered there."

"That may be true, but it doesn't explain why you approached Mr. Riley." Jacob dug further. "After all, he didn't press charges after landing at the hospital."

"If he didn't press charges, then I wonder why it is your business what I do in my free time and why I do it."

Jacob sighed, and Deziree understood why. Had Devil denied any connection, then he might have had a chance to notice a lie on her part. And if not, it would've told him that he was heading in the wrong direction. In other words he really hadn't learned anything from that.

Still, his behavior was strange. Jacob was nervous, Deziree could tell that and probably so could Devil. But if he was so nervous, why was he asking such touchy questions? There was something else on his mind.

"I'll get to that," Jacob answered. "First I want to know about your connection to Susan Harland."

"Susan who?" Devil lied.

Had Deziree not already known that Devil was lying here, she would have been fooled as well.

"The woman Mr. Riley had an affair with shortly before you assaulted him!" Jacob calmly continued.

Now even James's eyes widened. Devil and Deziree had followed their conversation earlier with their super hearing, and Jacob hadn't mentioned this important detail there. But instead of widening, Devil's eyes narrowed.

"What are you implying?" she asked dangerously.

"A two-timing man gets attacked a day after his affair is found out. Which means at least two women had a motive to get back at him."

"I take offense in calling it an attack when even the victim doesn't call it as such," Devil countered.

Now Deziree was getting nervous too. It was obvious that Jacob was on the right track, yet the way he did it only pissed her off. Why didn't he even try to be more polite?

"I think we should calm down a bit," she said hoping that this would lighten up the mood.

Next to her James nodded in agreement. He didn't seem to be in the best mood - not a surprise given the earlier conversation - but at least he was aware that Jacob's course of action was dangerous.

Jacob looked back at them, and when their eyes met, Deziree could see his expression becoming friendlier. She smiled at the effect she had on him. Apparently she had defused the situation.

"Sorry, I didn't mean to insult you. I just had a rough day." Jacob subconsciously touched his arm - where Deziree knew he was bandaged. She didn't need to apply her X-ray vision to see that either, as she had been the one to apply the bandages.

"So, Desire," now James picked up the conversation. "What's your story?"

Now this was a topic she didn't really want to discuss with him. After all, it would be easy for them to track her story back to her.

"Well... uhm, there isn't much to tell yet. Drank some stuff, ended up like this and that's pretty much it already. But I think I turned out fine, don't you agree?" She proudly stuck out her chest to prove her point. The men didn't know it was her, but it was hard for a mortal woman to compare to what she was now anyway.

The reactions varied on that. Devil cuckled knowingly, James nodded in approval and Jacob... well he outright stared at her chest. Deziree couldn't avoid a chuckle herself.

"So... this is really part of the whole package?" Jacob asked. "Just to clarify, I mean."

"There's a reason it's called the most common superpower after all," Devil laughingly added.

"I wonder if there's any scientific explanation for that," Jacob thought out loud. "I mean it's a bit strange that having super powers includes physical attractiveness."

"Actually," Devil began to explain. "The increased muscularity is an obvious side-effect of the vastly increased strength, fortunately we don't look the part there. Our bodies are powered by some strange energy that makes fat cells obsolete - and we store most of this energy in our breasts - hence their size."

"Strange energy? Stored inside your breasts? That... doesn't really make sense."

"Neither does being able to fly, yet here we are," Deziree interrupted. "I know it's hard to understand, but we can see this energy and feel it inside our bodies. And it's more effective than fat cells alone would be."

"But why the breasts? Not that I'm complaining but even I know that this isn't the first place for women to store extra energy."

"You have remember that the powers come from a plant - which obviously stored the excess energy in the form of this superpower granting liquid. The milk glands are pretty much the human equivalent to that."

"Sounds plausible..." Jacob turned towards James. "Or is that just me?"

James shook his head. "No, sounds pretty logical to me too. How that energy works, however will have to be further examined before we understand that."

Nodding, Jacob turned his attention back to Deziree, his curiosity getting the better of him. "What does it feel like?"

Deziree smiled at the attention. "Well, it's hard to describe. It's like a constant warmth, comforting yet at the same time it feels so … fresh and alive."

Jacob stared at her with an open mouth. "How about flying? Is it hard?"

"Oh I can't even begin to describe that. It just feels great to soar through the air, to be able to go where I want. The ultimate feeling of freedom so to speak. And no it's not hard, it's just natural."

"Ahem," Devil cleared her throat. "And as you can see it's harder to keep her feet on the ground than to fly."

Deziree noticed what the other superwoman had meant as she descended back onto her seat. Somewhere during her description she had begun to hover out of it and almost exposed her powers.

"Sorry," she added, blushing. "It's all just very new to me." She explained to Jacob.

"Indeed it is," Devil continued, looking at Jacob first and then addressing Deziree. "You haven't tested out the whole power-sharing part yet, right?"

Deziree looked at her quizzically. "Uhm, no I haven't. But didn't you say it was rather easy to do?"

"I sure did," Devil confirmed with a smile. "But it doesn't hurt to practice a bit. Trust me, I speak out of experience here. How about you go out and show Jacob here how it works?"

Now Deziree understood her actual intent. James was Devil's best shot at getting the information she needed, so she probably wanted Jacob out of the picture for that. Why exactly Jacob was in the way here, Deziree didn't know - it was probably his curiosity. Not that she would complain here anyway.

"What do you think?" she asked Jacob, who seemed a bit stunned by the idea.

"Power sharing?" he asked.

"In short, we can temporary share part of our powers through skin contact. It's not as effective as actually being super, but it's really convenient when you don't want someone to get hurt," Devil explained.

"Uhm," Jacob looked at James, probably wondering why he had been chosen here.

"Go ahead," the scientist nodded. "I think I'll go with the more scientific questions while you're gone."

That caused Jacob to laugh. "Well, that's your field of expertise after all." And to Deziree he added, "So we're going?"

Deziree nodded with a smile and they both made their way to the exit.

 

 

JJ was still confused about the conversation with Michelle when a sudden noise broke this train of thought. It was the sound of something knocking against the window. And twice at that. Wondering who would go through the trouble of raising attention this way instead of the doorbell, JJ marched towards it and pushed the curtains aside...  and almost fainted on the spot.

Outside the window was a stunning blonde woman with bright blue eyes. She wore nothing more than a black leotard, sitting cross-legged on thin air. JJ blinked twice to check that there really was no ladder or rope to support this beauty - she was really flying under her own power.

JJ gulped as she draw the logical conclusion. This was the woman that had been all over the news today. The worlds first superhero, the Angel. And for some weird reason, she was right outside the window and gesturing for JJ to open it. Sure enough, JJ complied.

"Three minutes and twenty-four seconds from my place to yours. Fast enough?" the goddess asked with a playful grin.

 

 

"Finally alone," Amanda said once the other two had left the bar. "You can imagine that I have a few questions I didn't want them to hear."

"I suspected as much," James answered as he took a sip of his beer. "That goes both ways, actually."

"Yeah. We kinda eavesdropped on your conversation earlier. Wanna talk about it first?"

"No, you can start if you want."

"Alright," Amanda took a long breath. "You know who I am, right?"

"Yes."

"So … how's the autopsy going?" She cut right to the chase.

"Slowly. The cause of death was a heart attack - probably caused by her transforming back to normal."

"Any details on that? Can you say whether it was her decreasing invulnerability or the simple fact that her heart returned to its usual shape, like the rest of her body?"

"I can't say for sure. It's probably the latter combined with the decreased immune system shortly after the first transformation that could have done it. As I said, the autopsy progresses slowly and I had a few distractions today."

"Yeah, I heard about the thing with the Harland bitch. Is it true that she didn't fully transform back to normal?"

"Indeed. Although I have no idea why."

"Hm...Desire had an idea about that. It was probably some kind of overdose on the potion - which also caused Ms. Harland to lactate the excess energy as superpower-granting milk."

James' eyes widened. "What? Super milk? I haven't seen any of that lying around. And how does Des... oh I get it: Deziree. She must've snuck it out before anybody noticed."

"She didn't give her actual name - but she said she was one of your colleagues that got attacked today."

James sighed. "Just great. She really didn't put much thought into that. How does she intend to hide that?"

"I have no idea," Amanda answered. "But let's get back to topic: I've got a theory and I'd like to hear your opinion about it's feasibility."

 

 

"This should be far enough," Deziree announced as they reached the park.

She and Jacob had walked all the way here in order not to be spotted during their little test flight. On the way they had engaged in small talk with her asking about his work and his life in general - while avoiding giving him any hint about her true identity. That aspect was getting harder and harder as they talked. Not that it was a big challenge for her to circumvent any tricky topic, she quickly lost much motivation to do so. After all, Jacob had played a big role in saving her life earlier and it felt bad to lie to him when he so openly told about himself. And it didn't help that she was having a good time now.

Jacob looked around. "Yep, seems like we're alone. So... uhm how does this work again?"

"In short, I can share certain powers through skin contact." Deziree reached out her hand. "Ready?"

Jacob looked at her a bit surprised, obviously doubting that holding hands would make him fly with her. Still he grasped her hand.

Deziree immediately felt what Devil had explained to her in theory. It felt rather easy to push some of her super energy into his body, and she tried it out right away. But instead of making him weightless, she first took care of his wounds by making him invulnerable. Devil had mentioned that this would also relieve his pain.

"Wow, that feels nice."

"I'm glad you like it, now let's become airborne shall we?"

Jacob looked into her eyes and nodded.

Not wasting any more time, Deziree put her plans in motion. A second later, the both began hovering off the ground, slowly rising into the air.

"How does it feel?" she asked. "Should be even better, right?"

"It's... kinda dizzy actually."

Now that wasn't what she had expected to hear. To her it was one of the most pleasureable feelings she had experienced so far. This was probably because her senses were more acute and most importantly adapted to the powers she possessed.

"Too bad. You're really missing something here. Do you want me to stop?"

"No," he answered. "I'd like to see the world from your view once."

This caused Deziree to fasten their ascend even before she consciously decided to do so. "Alright, hold tight!"

Jacob didn't need to be asked twice.

 

 

It took Michelle about half an hour to explain her situation to JJ. Unsurprisingly her sibling showed a great interest in the abilities Michelle had acquired, what she had done with them so far and - of course - her new look.

"It's still hard to believe that my older sister is now some kind of supergirl."

"Trust me, even I find it hard to believe at times. And this sudden spike in popularity doesn't help either. It's just weird when people talk about me while I am present in my normal form."

"So … you can switch back and forth?"

"I tried. Mostly I turn back when I run out of steam, but I can force myself back to normal too under certain conditions - for now."

"Could you -you know- show me?"

"Unfortunately not," Michelle answered. "I have too much energy inside me to do that right now."

She let her head drop as she considered this part. There was also the issue of reaching 100% of her capacity.

"What's the matter?" JJ asked.

"Well... it's just that at some point I will be stuck like this..." Michelle hesitantly said. "I mean, right now I just have too much energy inside me to will myself back to normal, but if I reach a certain point I will never transform back, even when I'm out of energy..."

"And that would be bad because...?"

"Right now I can live a normal life by day and transform when danger calls. A double life, so to speak. But that would be over once I'm stuck as this."

"And?" JJ dug further.

"And what? Isn't losing that enough already? I mean, I can't even begin to imagine how Mum and Dad would react upon learning about this. Then there's all my coworkers...in short everybody I know would be affected. Nothing would be the same again!"

"Hm, interesting."

"Is that all you can say about that?"

"I was just surprised that you didn't mention your boyfriend. Given that you barely know him..."

"He knows about this," Michelle explained. "He's a scientist and somehow tracked me down after my first night out as this. Long story short we went out, got together and I told him."

"So what's the problem with him? Doesn't he like this hot version of you?"

 

 

"I think this is too risky!" James said after Amanda had told him about her plan. "There are too many unknowns that could cause complications. And given Ms. Riley's example, complications mean death!"

"Doing nothing would mean the same," Amanda countered. "The Harland's Syndrome was the reason she died upon transforming back. If she hadn't transformed back she would still be alive and kicking! All we have to do is prevent that and everything will be fine."

"It would require permanent use of that potion."

"Not exactly. Eventually he would be able to absorb sunlight on his own and become independent of the potion. Not to mention the aspect of not transforming at all after an overdose."

"We don't know that for sure."

"We could test it out first. All that's needed is an overdose and if I don't turn back afterwards, we have our answer."

 "Well... since it's your body I can't stop you from testing it out. But you are aware that you'd be stuck like that."

Amanda rolled her eyes. "So what? If all goes to plan, so would he. Sounds only fair to end up the same way."

"And if it doesn't go according to plan: he dies. Are you willing to take that risk?" James sighed. "Why do I get the feeling that you just want to have a super partner?"

"That's just a fortunate side-effect," Amanda countered with a slight grin before her expression became more serious. "But it seems you see this differently. Did this strike a nerve?"

"You could say that."

"Is it about the 'rushing things' you mentioned earlier? I know Michelle took some of the potion after kicking that Harland girl's ass."

"Yeah, she really wants me to take that stuff as well." James took another sip of his beer, emptying it. "Just to spice things up."

"Just to spice things up? That doesn't sound like her."

"It's her instincts. She may claim to spice things up or something like that, but her instincts tell her that as we are now we can't procreate, so she searches for a solution there. Having me drink the potion is that solution. And she doesn't like any reasoning against it because of that."

"Have you actually discussed the pros and cons of you taking the potion?"

"Mainly the cons, actually. She may have managed to live her normal life so far, but I am working at a facility that specifically looks for strange things, and her stunt with the plane has made the existence of supers public. It's not like I could hide it long-term. Especially if your theory about the super form becoming permanent over time is to be believed. But she doesn't want to hear that. She has this inner voice that tells her everything is going to work out and gets mad when I don't buy it as easily."

"Yeah, you may have your reasons for declining, but did you hear her out? She's bound to have more reasons for wanting this than a hunch."

"Well," James looked at his empty beer. "She kinda left before we could finish the discussion."

Now that he thought about it, Michelle seemed more hurt by the fact that he was against it than the arguments he used for that.

"Oh I can imagine how that one went: She brought it up without actually considering that you might be against it and thus was utterly lost in an argument."

"Yeah that sounds about right."

Amanda sighed. "And here I thought you had this super telepathic connection to each other that made understanding so much easier."

"Seems like that one backfired. She clearly felt that I was against it and left before she got too pissed-off. I think she needs to cool herself down a bit and she'll be fine."

"Let me ask you one thing: Are you against taking the potion in general? Or can you imagine that you'd take the potion eventually?"

James took a few seconds to think about that.

"It's not that I can't imagine doing that. But right now it would feel rushed. I mean, let's be honest. I've known her for half a week now. We're freshly in love and thus not in the position to make life-changing decisions. Taking the potion is a one-way road. It's a kind of commitment that shouldn't be rushed like that. I mean, even marriage is reversible...but this isn't."

 

 

"So you're basically mad at him because he didn't want to take the same stuff that turned you into this?" JJ concluded.

"Pretty much," Michelle confirmed, already expecting what JJ was about to say next.

"Didn't you say that you weren't totally ok with the long-term effects of this stuff? Like being stuck like this? Sounds a bit hypocritical to me, for you to want him in the same dilemma as yourself. Why would you want that anyway?"

"It's … complicated. For one thing, ever since I first transformed like this I wondered what it would be like to be with a man on the same level. I mean, it's already way better than normal this way but I still have to hold back somewhat and protect him from my own strength."

"Uhm... I can somewhat understand this argument, but I don't really think it would be worth the downsides."

"Yeah, he already mentioned that this might be my instincts way of telling me to procreate, and I can't really claim that he's wrong there. Anyway I do have other reasons, too. He's working at a facility that researches the meteor aftermath - which includes supers as a whole."

"Wait...there are more than you?"

"Yes there are. I only shared some with Amanda so far, but there seems to be someone else passing the stuff around as well. And here's the problem: Just today, James was in the middle of another woman's rampage. That woman was out and about to go on a killing spree for no apparent reason, and he would have been killed if not for my interference."

"And here I thought scientists had a safe job."

"So did I, but this woman proved otherwise. And when I think about it further, this won't change in the long run. I mean, if there are more supers out there and he's the one tracking them down, it's much more likely for them to react with hostility. If he were super himself, then he wouldn't have to fear stuff like that."

"Wouldn't this be counterproductive for him as well? I mean, if his bosses research supers, wouldn't they start with him first? Given how different you look I doubt he would be able to hide it."

Michelle bit her lip. "Probably not," she admitted. "Even the unpowered form is slightly improved and someone would find it suspicious. Still, it's … he is … I just don't want him to get hurt, ok?"

JJ laughed at that. "I can understand that. But this won't be much of an argument if you start talking about how it would help him at his job. You care about his well-being and that's good. Still, you have only known him for a few days so far. You'll have to give it more time instead of rushing it."

Michelle frowned. "It's different from my perspective. We've got this bond... it's hard to put into words, but it somehow allows me to know him better than I could've dreamed of. It's like I glimpsed into his naked soul...and at times I can literally see the world through his eyes. This is how I was there in time to save him today, by the way. In short it feels like I've known him for years."

"Now that sounds romantic. But does he feel the same way?" JJ asked.

"Oh he loves me, I can feel that."

"No...What I mean is, does this bond goes both ways? Does he know you just as good as you know him?"

"Well, the bond does go both ways, yes..."

Michelle thought about it. JJ had raised a good point. Back on Saturday, when Michelle had brought Amanda out for some training, she had found out that her power sharing wasn't as efficient as her own powers. Back then she had empowered Amanda who had been able to lift a few tons - but had also clearly felt the strain as her body wasn't used to handling the super energy. Things had changed quite drastically when Amanda had drunk the potion as her powers were on the same level as Michelle's. What if this bond worked the same way?

"You may have a point there," she eventually admitted. "He may benefit from the bond, but it's possible that it's still more effective for me. In that case the only solution would be for him to take the potion... which is the problem here."

"It's not the only solution," JJ calmly said. "Give him enough time and he may come around. I mean, from what I see these powers have way more advantages than disadvantages."

Michelle was about to protest, but she realized how stupid that would be. "Yeah, you're right." She rose into the air, still in a sitting position while sticking out her chest. "I mean given enough time, who wouldn't want to be like that?"

JJ only nodded in response and Michelle quickly figured the reason behind it.

"How about you? Would you want to be like this?" Michelle asked.

Now JJ outright froze. Michelle watched her sibling clearly struggle with the answer.

"Well... uhm, wow, I mean, I didn't expect you to ask me." JJ's stammering would have brought a smile to Michelle's face if it she weren't that interested in the answer. Now that she had asked the question, she really didn't want to hear a no. When she had asked Amanda the latter had declined - and drunk the potion a whole day later. James wasn't that fond of it, too. So far it seemed like anybody given the choice would chose not to do it - while she herself never had a choice.

"So?"

"I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to," JJ admitted. "But there's more to be considered here..."

"And that would be?"

Before JJ could answer they were interrupted by the distinct sound of keys that were about to be used to open a door.

"Kelly," JJ announced.

Michelle acted quickly, and silently flew into the next room. She would have flown right out of the window hadn't JJ closed it earlier - and despite her speed she wasn't capable of opening it quick and silent.

So she did the next best thing and hid in the first room she found - only to realize it was the bathroom. A quick glance to the bathroom window revealed that it was too small for her to slip through it. Michelle gulped as she realized that as long as she didn't want to be found, she was stuck here.
