### 01 - Changes in Paradise

"Damn it's hot," Patrick said to no one in particular.

He stretched out his back, stiff from bending over the mess of electronic parts spread out on the tarp in front of him. He was trying to repair a small, short wave radio that had unexpectedly been damaged. There wasn't much in the way of spare parts, and so Pat was trying to modify existing parts and materials. It was difficult, slow work, and he really didn't think he'd be able to fix it in the first place. But he had to try, the boat had been modified, or scavenged as the case may be, to serve as a power plant for the jungle laboratory he and John had set up. It would be impossible to restore it to a seaworthy condition, so the radio was the only hope of rescue. They had found all the evidence they needed to help Green Peace file a lawsuit on behalf of the aboriginal natives that had originally lived on the island, and now it was time to be rescued. Or at least, that was the original plan.

It had been two months since Pat and his old friend John had bought a small boat and secretly landed on the small, uncharted island northwest of Australia. Nuclear tests had been conducted near the island, and he and John were there, trying to document the damages that had been done. They hadn't been supported by any government agency, and they had even been denied permission to go. A few bribes in the right places, however, and they found themselves living in paradise.

Pat had been trying to fix the radio for several days, and he was becoming more and more sure that it was useless. He took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes in frustration. He looked around for a bit of cloth to clean his lenses, and couldn't find a clean one, their clothes had slowly disintegrated in the tropical heat. He and John had taken to wearing only their nylon swimsuits to cope with the weather, and as a result both had become golden brown from head to toe. He set his glasses aside and returned to his task.

He tried one more time to attach his jury-rigged transistor to the power cell and got the odd mixture of tree sap, metal filings, and ocean brine to hold the wire in place. Very carefully he switched on the power and waited for the familiar cackle that would indicate he had fixed the radio.

Nothing. Not even a blip. Then, a sudden crackle! No, that was someone coming up the path. Damn, and double damn, thought Pat.

"John," he called out towards the path from beach where his friend was returning from trying to spear dinner. "John, it looks like I'm just not technician enough to fix the damn radio."

"That's o.k. buddy, you're a molecular biologist, not an electronic engineer," John smiled as he trotted back to the small lab with a flounder firmly skewered on his homemade spear. "We'll be eating just fine tonight! We can worry about being rescued when I'm too old to fish," he joked.

Pat smiled wanly at John's joke. "Yea, but Green Peace will never be able to file that lawsuit without this evidence."

John nodded thoughtfully. "Well, there's not much we can do about it, is there. We cannibalized the boat so we could build the lab and the beach hut, and we planned on using the short wave to let somebody know we were here to be rescued. How could we know that a tsunami would rush up on the first hut we built and ruin our radio?"

"Yea, we're lucky that we decided to build the bio lab at least 200 feet higher up the side of the volcano than the other one, even though it was a pain to haul all the pieces of the boat up here. And the geothermal energy that powers some of the experiments has other uses too," mused Pat as he carefully put away the sea-stained, still ruined radio. "Having your own private hot tub on the side of a tropical mountain is something I could get used to. But that luxury will give me little comfort if we can't share the results of these experiments. I think the healing salve we were able to synthesize from the compounds of those species of fish that change gender may have real medical uses when, or if, we ever get back."

"Oh, we'll get back someday. There are enough of the wrong people in the right places who know that we were thinking of this crazy expedition in the first place. They'll soon enough put two and two together and figure out what we did," laughed John.

"I hope you're right," said Pat.

John gave Pat a reassuring thump on the back and jammed the spear into the soft loam floor of the hut. He looked down at his old friend with concern, searching the tanned lines of worry apparent around Pat's eyes. They had always made a great team; Pat the brains and John the brawn. At 6' 3'' John was an intimidating force that could easily make an angry fisherman back off of a protected fishing area. Pat formulated strategies and remedies for the various confrontations they had engaged in. But they were also loners, two of a kind, in a sense. They worked well together because they worked alone.

"What is it you think the fish goop will do?" asked John again.

"I'm not sure," responded Pat. "The compound seems to work miracles in healing scratches. See?" he said as he showed the fresh pink mark on his arm to John.

"That was this morning! It's already healed!" marveled John. "It wasn't a big cut, but it was a good one." He turned Pat's arm over slightly, tracing the thin, barely noticeable line along the outside of his arm. Pat had cut himself while trying to harvest some tree sap on a particularly thorny palm. It had been a deep cut, and Pat had put some of his homemade salve on it a few hours ago.

"Yes, amazing, isn't it. I knew that those secretions had something to do with rebuilding cell structure," said Pat.

Among the many beautiful and exotic fish found along the barrier reef that stretched across the small lagoon to the west were a species of fish that procreated in unusual ways. Tropical "painted shell" fish live in communities of all female fish with a single male that dominate and protect the harem. The male fish is significantly larger; allowing him to collect abandoned shells for the much smaller females to nest inside. Roving bands of smaller males attempt to muscle in on established harems, but the biggest fish usually wins.

The odd part, however, is that all fish are born female. Every single fish is born female. When the male dies, the largest female changes her gender and becomes the alpha male of the harem. Sometimes several other large females challenge at the same time, and the ones who lose the fight are driven off, renegade males in search of new harems.

Pat had synthesized the secretions of the transforming female-to-male fish and applied that to his cut. The results had been nothing short of miraculous.

"Man! It really worked!" said John. "That's just the ticket because I seem to have gotten bit by something, a crab I think, while I was fishing for supper." He turned his leg to show Pat and revealed a fresh tear in his calf. The wound wasn't as long as Pat's had been, but it was deeper.

"Christ! Why didn't you tell me you'd been hurt, and we've been sitting here wasting time. Does it hurt?" asked Pat.

"Nah, I barely feel it," he responded. "You want to try that stuff on it?"

"Yea, it will confirm what I think has happened to me," Pat enthused.

Pat took a small vial from a shelf and spread a small amount of cream colored liquid on John's calf. John sighed immediately as the restorative effects of the salve began its work. Pat worked carefully, getting all parts of his wound covered.

"Wow, that stuff sure works quick. I don't even feel the bite of the salt water any longer," John reported. "Not only are we going to kick some government agency butt when we get back, we'll be rich too!"

"First, why don't you see about getting that fish ready for dinner. I found some mangos while I was looking for those rubber trees and I think I can whip us up something that will knock your socks off," said Pat.

They had fallen into some routines early in their work. John could build just about any kind of shelter, keep a fire going in the rain, and hunt and trap food of all kinds. He was also a crack navigator, pilot, and could get anything that floated, flew, or rolled to almost any destination in the world. Pat, on the other hand, was a pure scientist who constantly tinkered and combined things to create new formulas and understandings of how things worked. This knowledge also contributed to his uncanny ability to cook. Because he understood, on a chemical level, how acids, bases, other elements of all food came together, he was an expert chef. Even stranded as they were on a remote and mostly ignored island, Pat had provided a steady diet of marvelous food flavored with the flora and fauna that surrounded them.

Although neither of them would have identified their roles along gender lines, Pat stayed at home and performed domestic activities while John spent his days building and hunting to provide Pat the raw materials he needed to sustain their existence. The results of their combined labors were impressive. The "lab" was actually a series of small buildings perched on the lower half of the small volcano that gave birth to the island. The boat and its original fixtures had been completely transformed into a Swiss Family Robinson like camp they had constructed. The main hut was centered over a small geothermal vent that John had tamed into a forced air convection oven, a plain slab griddle, and a Bunsen burner that served as the catalyst for Pat's various experiments. The hut was kept cool via the constant dripping of water from the thatched roof. An aqueduct constructed from bamboo fed the camp with a steady supply of water from a nearby mountain stream that was surprisingly cool given the amount of thermal activity in the area. Each man had his own sleeping hut similarly cooled, and a forth hut served as their storage area for basic foodstuffs.

The aqueduct also fed water into their "hot tub" that had been created out of natural depression in a rock outcropping just above the camp. John had diverted part of the hot air from the geothermal vent with scrape metal and a sort of cement he had invented that combined pulverized volcanic rock and the rubber sap Pat had used to try to fix the radio. The result was nearly invisible, except for the small valve the popped up from the edge of the rock pool that regulated the airflow in to the tub. The outcropping gave them clear views of the lagoon below and the sky above, and they both had enjoyed spending time in the warm, bubbling water as the evenings cooled and the starts twinkled.

If they got too hot, they could follow the aqueduct as it twisted and turned another hundred yards up and a few hundred yards west around the side of the mountain to the natural pool that had formed at the base of a small waterfall. The stream was spring fed and was cooler than almost any other, probably due to a large deposit of granite on that side of the volcano. Both Pat and John took daily jaunts up to the waterfall to bathe as the water was nether too cold nor too hot. It was a great way to rinse the salt, grit, and wind from their bodies after a long day cataloguing fish or collecting samples.

All in all, it was a paradise. The jungle was rich with fruits and roots, and the lagoon was rich with a wide variety of fish and shellfish. The days were hot but kept cool by the constant breezes, and the nights were cool and mild. Although neither man wanted to stay there forever, they weren't panicked by the idea that rescue might be far off. They had carved out a pleasant lifestyle on the island, and they knew they would be missed eventually. All it took was time.

The delicate whitefish simmered in a mango broth was indeed the "knockyour -socks-off" meal that Pat had promised. The steamed hearts of palm with baby fronds were a magnificent complement to the fish. The only thing missing was a fine Chardonnay.

"It's too bad that the tropics don't support grapes," Pat mused as he finished the last of his fish. "Wine is the only part of civilization that I really miss out here."

"I've been thinking about that," said John, "and tomorrow I'm going to see about building a small still from the last parts of the gas tank and boat engine. Seeing as how we don't need the generator since the radio is kaput, we don't need the engine either."

"I suppose you're right, but I am reluctant to dismantle the engine as I could still use the generator in the lab. I know we've discovered just about everything we set out to, but as long as we're stuck here, I'd like to continue working," said Pat.

"Yea, but wouldn't water power work? I can rig part of the aqueduct towards a water wheel, and that can power the generator, then we can use the last of the boat parts to construct a still. Besides, the still can be used for other things like making bigger batches of that fish goop, or cooking a really big stew for when we have guests over for dinner," John said with a smirk.

"I'm just reluctant to dismantle the last remnants of the boat for what is basically a comfort measure ... but you're right. I don't need to use the micro-scanner or the computer very often, and we will eventually run out of gas. I guess we can start on that tomorrow," said Pat with a sigh.

They cleaned up the last of the dinner and put the metal dishes into the "automatic dishwasher," a small kettle that kept boiling fed by a constant stream of new water from the aqueduct. In the morning, all the dishes would be sterilized and the water would be ready for a coffee like brew that Pat made with crushed leaves and bark of several coca like plants.

As Pat lay awake on his bed, he marveled at the speed with which his cut had been healed. He couldn't feel any trace of the wound, the new pink skin having perfectly blended with the rest of his arm. The moon had cast more than enough light, and he couldn't see a trace of the deep scratch he had suffered only that morning. It was amazing, really; a first class medical discovery. It was a discovery, however, that would have to wait until they were rescued. And Pat knew it could be months before that happened, but he fell asleep with a smile on his face, knowing they could survive for years on the island.

Pat's dreams that night were extraordinarily vivid. He was swimming in the lagoon, surrounded by thousands of brightly colored tropical fish. The water was warm and the sunlight softly illuminated the coral reef. He was underwater without any kind of snorkel or aqua-lung, but he wasn't afraid. Above him, he could see the outline of John swimming above him, strong and sleek as his powerful strokes propelled him through the water. Pat felt safe and protected looking up at his large, well-built partner slicing through the water. When he woke in the morning, he felt strangely at peace.

John shared similar dreams over their morning tea. He had been hunting sand sharks and had followed them down below the surface of the water before he realized that he was breathing naturally with no artificial aids. They both marveled at the vivid nature of the dreams but drew no other conclusions.

"Let's get started on the still, shall we?" asked John.

"First I want to examine your calf," said Pat.

John hefted his leg up onto the table he had built for their meals, and Pat carefully examined his former cut. Like his own, John's cut was completely and nearly invisibly healed. "Amazing, just amazing!" marveled Pat, "It's almost miraculous."

"Yea, at least we won't be in danger getting a fatal infection from a skin wound while we're stuck here! Let's get started on the day, shall we?" prompted John.

They set to work immediately, and by midday, they had completed the modifications to the gas tank to make the still. Together they set off to gather the materials they would need to make their first batch of tropical beverage. It wasn't until the late afternoon that they took a break for food.

"Hey, do you notice a change in your energy level today?" asked Pat as he nibbled lightly on some fresh fruit.

"Yes, now that you mention it, I feel better than I've felt in a long time. We've been going strong all day, and it's late for lunch, but I'm not starving or anything," reported John as he tore into the whitefish Pat had brought with them.

"I'm feeling very similarly," said Pat. "I wonder if it has anything to do with the salve I used on us yesterday?"

"It might, and if it did, then you're an even bigger genius than I thought," joked John. "I feel great!"

"So do I, but I hope there isn't a piper to be paid for this tune," said Pat.

"What do you mean by that?" asked John.

"Oh, I don't know. Probably nothing," Pat mused. "If the goop is doing all this to us, it's unlikely that this is all it's doing. There might be more that is happening to us, but I'd have to run some tests."

"Seeing as how I feel really great, stronger than I've ever felt in my life, I'm not too worried about it."

"Yea, John, I know. But ... and I do mean but, I am not feeling strength, though I do feel pretty good. High energy is more like it."

John gave his old friend a good look. Pat had always been the thinner of the two men, smaller in stature, but always in good shape. Both of their hair had grown longer and both kept it in a pony tail most of the time. Pat's hair, however, looked thicker today for some strange reason, and softer as it fell about his face and glasses. Now what made that thought come to mind? John looked at his own feet and hands as he puzzled over the sudden embarrassment that washed over him when he looked at Pat. What was that about?

Pat didn't notice John's piercing gaze and subsequent embarrassment. He was trying to catalogue how he felt and had his eyes closed, concentrating on feeling his body. He had noticed that his hair seemed healthier this morning, a bit fuller and lighter in color. He hoped that was simply the vitality the goop had created and not what he already suspected might be a side effect of the fish compound. He noticed that the breeze felt fresh and delicate on his face, and the warmth of the sun seemed more present on his skin. Everything seemed more colorful, alive; it was like his senses had been switched on to full power for the first time in his life. He also noted that his vision seemed to be changing, he saw colors, particularly reds, much more vividly, or so he thought, and the glasses seemed less necessary as the day wore on. He couldn't be sure, yet, and so he said nothing.

They finished their meal and gathered the supplies they hoped would produce their first batch of tropical wine. When they got back to the camp, they immediately started on their first attempt.

"Do you think we should use more citrus or more berry in the mix?"

"Berry, definitely berry. There's already too much acid in the mash, and we need more sugars," said Pat, "sugar!"

John glanced up at his friend and gave him a strange smile. They never called each other by pet names. What the heck was that for, and why was he feeling embarrassed each time he glanced at Pat? John pushed these thoughts aside and hefted another load of star fruit, guava, and wild-berry mix into the fermentation pot.

Pat concentrated on adjusting the fire beneath the pot, furious with himself for calling John by an endearment. What was he doing? Where had that come from? Why was he feeling so awkward around his old friend? That sort of thing had never happened before.

"This is going to need to cook for a few hours. What do you say we wash the grime of the jungle off before we tackle dinner?" asked Pat.

"Sure buddy," John emphasized the 'buddy,' "let's go jump in the hot tub."

They both went to their own huts and took off their nylon shorts in preparation for a swim. Both men had been naked in front of each other many times, but both felt a hesitation this time. John looked down at himself and could see the stirrings of an erection, his cock half-hard and beginning to fill with blood. Pat looked down and wondered if he had always looked this scrawny, and he noticed that his body hair seemed lighter. He pushed his fears aside when he heard John splash into the hot tub, and Pat left his hut.

John relaxed in the tub and the warm water gently swirled and bubbled around him. He had taken great pains to follow Pat's engineering to the letter, and the hot tub was not only a working wonder in the jungle, it was beautiful to behold. The polished black rock made a perfect basin for the tub, and he had used parts from the boat to make the hot air bubble through the fresh water. Between the cool water and the hot air, the tub was usually very pleasant.

As Pat walked up the path towards the tub, John noticed the something else was very different about him. Pat seemed paler, losing some of the golden tan they had both acquired. John also felt the return of his embarrassment; no-it wasn't embarrassment-it was attraction. John felt attracted to his old friend and co-worker Pat. Impossible! He had never felt that way before! Sure, he loved Pat and wasn't afraid to say it when it really mattered, but he had never felt sexually attracted to him or any man. He tore his eyes from Pat and looked instead off into the distance over the ocean where the beginnings of a sunset teased the horizon.

Pat had felt the white heat of John's stare and recognized the embarrassed look John had now. But, because he couldn't think of anything else he should do, he simply slipped into the water opposite his old friend. Both men had let their hair down, and Pat noticed that John's hair was darker and healthier than ever. In fact, all of John's hair seemed darker and healthier. There was hair on his chest and shoulders, and his navel and his ... Pat broke his gaze away, realizing that he had been staring at John's crotch.

They both sat in silence for many minutes before Pat finally announced that he had had enough for one evening. John muttered good night, and Pat walked back down to his sleeping hut alone. When he stepped into the soft glow of the oil lamp he had rigged, he looked at himself carefully in the mirror. He took off his glasses and noted that he no longer needed them; he could see perfectly. What ever was happening to him, it was going to be a doozy.

The changes were more obvious now, he thought to himself. He had felt his body tingling and twitching constantly while sitting in John's presence in the hot tub, and the psychological changes were more pronounced than he had suspected. Pat understood the mechanisms that the painted shell fish had undergone during their sex change, but he hadn't thought the opposite was possible or likely. Looking at his considerably longer hair, softened facial features, and subtly thinner waist, he was now sure that it was not only possible, but that it was happening to him.

What was odd, he thought to himself, was that he wasn't too upset. He had never had a significant relationship with either a man or a woman because he was so wrapped up in his work. Pat had long thought that he might be gay, and though that thought didn't upset him, he had never been attracted enough to anyone to act on it. Correction, he thought to himself, he had never been attracted to another gay man enough to act on it. He knew that his friendship with John was the longest relationship he had ever had, but he also knew that John was about a straight as they come.

Pat looked closer into the mirror. His eyes had shifted color from their normal blue/green to a more brilliant green. His normally dirty blond hair seemed to be moving towards an auburn or red tint. His chest and arms were nearly hairless, and his pubic hair seemed thinner. He still looked like himself, he decided, though he could see that femininity was creeping into his body structure and facial features.

He heard John come back through the camp and go into his own hut. He fought an urge to go to him and instead slipped into his bed and fell almost immediately asleep. Just like the night before, Pat began having extraordinary and vivid dreams. This time Pat found himself floating in the hot tub, looking out over a surreal sunset. John was standing at the edge of the cliff, framed against the rich colors of the sunset, posing like a Greek god. Pat could feel his long hair float about his body, gently caressing himself, and he was aware of a heavy weight on his chest. In his dream, he looked down and saw two large female breasts sprouting up through the surface of the water, their thick nipples erect in the cool evening air. Pat struggled to wake up, and found it was the next morning.

For the next two months, both men struggled with their quickly developing, new feelings for each other, but the physical changes slowly progressed for both men. John had slowly become the picture of male vitality, sharply muscled with wide shoulders tapering down to a washboard waist and strong thighs. Pat, on the other hand, had continued to slim down, and his hips had ached as they ever so slightly widened while he often felt like a great weight sat on his rib cage as his bones seemed to slowly shrink in his arms, legs, and chest.

Their only solace was that they had completed the still and therefore enjoyed many batches of a sweet, tropical rum punch. Each man had been self-medicating with the punch, hoping that the feelings of attraction would fade away. They avoided each other as much as possible, meeting only during meals. At the end of the two months, they both knew that significant changes were occurring, but their feelings of attraction and confusion had far outstripped the actual physical changes.

Pat stood, for the hundredth time, before the mirror in his hut. He catalogued, once again, the changes his body had undergone. He was a few inches shorter, his waist was slightly indented above hips that had widened slightly. His hair was a darker auburn and his eyes were greener than they had been a few weeks ago. His body hair had thinned or fallen out to the point where it wasn't noticeable, and his lips seemed ever so slightly thicker. He felt sure that the goop had wrought these changes, but he was surprised at his feelings concerning the changes.

He liked them.

He knew that the goop was slowly changing his gender, or at least that is what it would probably do. He knew that John was the more physically dominant human of the two of them, and so if the goop was going to imitate in humans what it did in fish, Pat was going to be the female of the species. The prospect thrilled him and frightened him. Why did he have these feelings? He had never before focused much on sex; he had always had his work. But as he stared at his morphed body in the mirror, he was sure that he wanted to see this experiment continue.

Of course, he was a man of science. Well, perhaps not a man, at any rate, much longer, he thought to himself.

He turned away from the mirror and went into the connecting hut that served as the laboratory. He picked up the bottle that contained the goop and then went to the still. John had already gone up to the hot tub to ease away the pains of the day, and so Pat could work in privacy. He drew two long drinks of the tropical punch in two bamboo mugs, and then he put a liberal dose of the fish goop into each drink. He stirred them slightly, and then with his heart pounding, he walked up the path towards the hot tub, carrying the two drinks. Pat was sure that if superficial application of the goop to their skins had already wrought these changes, then an internal application of a massive amount of goop might do the trick.

John was comfortably lounging in the warm and bubbling water, naked. Pat had rarely come up to the hot tub for the last month, so John felt reasonably safe from both his own feelings and from what he suspected were Pat's feelings as well. John was as equally puzzled as Pat; he had always been attracted to women, and had left several beauties in his wake. Why then, he wondered, was he so attracted to his oldest, best, and male friend? He was pondering this question, with his eyes closed, when he heard Pat slip into the hot tub opposite him.

"Pat, you startled me," he exclaimed, sitting straight, the waves he stirred up nearly causing Pat to spill the drinks he was balancing. "What are you up to?"

"Me? Not much. I got tired of us treating each other like strangers and thought that a toast to old times might help. What do you say, my old friend?" Pat paused, holding one drink out to John. John took a slight moment, and then reached out to grasp the proffered beverage, rising slightly from the water and giving Pat a clear view of his crotch. Pat felt himself blush as he realized what he was seeing. He also felt himself get warm and tingly all over.

"I suppose you're right, we have been treating each other strangely," John mused, sipping his drink. "Why do you suppose that is?"

"I have lots of theories, and none of them are easy. My best guess, as I am sure that you are already aware, is that the fish goop has altered our bodies and our feelings. Does that about sum it up?" Pat stared boldly at his friend, seeking encouragement for what he hoped would begin to happen.

"I think you have put it, as usual, succinctly and accurately. What do we do about it?" John asked.

"Well, if it's o.k. with you, I think we should deal with it head on, so to speak," Pat suggested.

"What do you mean by that?" John asked.

"I can see that you've become more masculine, and I also can see that you've noticed that I've become more feminine. If your feelings towards me are similar to the ones I'm feeling towards you, then you have become attracted to me. Am I right so far?" asked Pat.

John let out a deep sigh, and began to softly chuckle. "That's right, my old friend. You rarely beat around the bush when it comes to crises. I've been going crazy trying to figure out why I started to find you so sexy. Now, I guess, I know."

"Ditto. Would you be adverse to seeing the experiment reach its logical conclusion?" Pat asked hesitantly.

"You mean more goop?" John asked.

"Yes, and more changes."

"You mean you're willing to let the changes continue?" asked John with surprise. "That means that you might become a woman."

"I know," Pat stated.

"Wow."

"Yea, wow." Pat paused. "So, what do you want?"

John looked across the pool at his oldest and best friend. He could see the changes that had already happened as Pat had entered the pool naked too, and the changes were all towards an old fantasy woman he had since college: auburn hair, green eyes, tall and voluptuous. "I think that the changes are being triggered by me. I mean I have to participate in this experiment too, right? The fish only changed while in the absence of a male, so you'll probably only fully change in the presence of one."

"I have always known that your brains far exceeded everyone's perceptions," Pat teased.

"So, what do we do now," asked John.

"Drink up!" replied Pat, "I'm afraid that I already spiked the punch in anticipation of your agreement."

"Here's to the start of a beautiful friend ... ship," toasted John as he gulped the large drink down. Pat matched his old friend, swallow for swallow. They both put down their bamboo mugs and looked across the pool at each other. They both knew what was going to happen, but neither knew exactly how or when the changes would occur. The longer they stared at each other, the greater the tension grew.

"I can't take it any longer," sputtered John as he waded across the pool towards the transfixed Pat, "I have to kiss you. I know you still look like my old buddy, more or less, but I can't stop this feeling growing inside me."

Pat lifted his face towards his old friend as John slowly lowered himself next to him in the pool. He had seen the raging hard on that John had, and he had felt tingly and warm as John approached him. Pat was hyper aware of the smell of John, a deep musk scent that was driving him crazy. As John put his arm around his shoulders, it seemed perfectly natural that he should tilt his head back to accept his kiss.

The kiss ... it was electric. Pat felt like a live wire had suddenly been attached to his lips. His whole body felt like it was on fire, and he was sure it wasn't because he was in the hot tub. The press of John's lips against his own was gentle but persistent, and suddenly he felt John's tongue slip inside his own mouth. He found it hard to breathe, suddenly, and felt crushed by John's arms as they tightened around his shoulders. But he didn't want to stop kissing, he didn't want to break the contact that provided his lips with the buzz of pleasure that he had never known it was possible to feel.

John gently drew back from the kiss and looked down at Pat as his old friend swooned in the afterglow of their kiss. In the few minutes that they had been kissing, John could already see small changes in Pat's body. He couldn't put is finger on it, but there seemed to be something decidedly feminine about his old friend, a stronger sense that Pat was well on his way towards Patricia.

His hair was longer and the hair nearest the scalp appeared to be a richer auburn color than the rest. Pat's face seemed more feminine, and his lips were fuller, swollen from the passion of the kiss. When Pat's eyes fluttered open, they were even brighter green than before, and now they glistened with emotion.

"I know that most cell structures replace themselves over relatively long periods of time, except for bones," Pat said, "But those fish seem to change genders in a few days."

"They are much less complex creatures than we are?" asked John.

"Not really," explained Pat as he gazed back into John's dark eyes, "The DNA we share with the rest of creation, mammals, fish, even insects, is actually quite significant. I'll bet we follow a similar time table."

"What are you saying?" asked John.

"I think you should 'dominate' me for the next couple of days, you know, stay with me and see if my bio-mechanical changes occur in similar ways to the fish," Pat explained.

John smiled. "Well, the sooner we get this change completed, the better. I've been going crazy with wondering what I should do about this monster between my legs."

"I'm not ready for much past kissing tonight, John," Pat shuddered involuntarily, "But I strongly suspect that if the goop works as it does in the fish, I won't feel that way for long."

They spent another few moments enjoying the closeness and intimacy of their hot tub. Pat noticed how much smaller he felt when held by John. He swore that he could almost feel the changes occurring, but he knew that was ridiculous. Unless, he mused, the goop released enzymes and proteins that attacked and changed bone structure. That might explain why his male body had taken on feminine proportions very quickly. His mind, however, he could clearly feel was well ahead of his body towards a female mindset. He snuggled in closer to John as the tropical evening blossomed into thousands of stars.

They decided to sleep in the same bed so that the changes would be as accelerated as possible. The next morning when Pat awoke, he found that his shoulders seemed a bit smaller and his rib cage had constricted further. He fixed himself another glass of goop mixed with punch and downed it before John woke up. The goop seemed to energize him, giving him incredible energy and speeding up his natural metabolism. It was better than coffee, but Pat suspected that the goop would be doing much more than simply waking him up.

When John awoke, Pat twirled before him.

"Your waist is smaller, and so are your shoulders, but I don't see any other differences," John observed.

"I feel different," Pat stated. "I feel more ... weak ... but in a good way. I don't know, it's strange. I can tell I am smaller, but there is something more important going on, I feel even more strongly attracted to you. And you've changed too!"

John looked at the mirror Pat had brought from his hut. John's hair was thicker and curly, and he felt great, stronger. He flexed in the mirror, impressed with the definition of his muscles.

"Oh, I like it," Pat murmured.

They locked eyes, and Pat threw himself at John with a low growl and thrust his own tongue inside John's surprised mouth.

They kissed for several minutes with growing intensity, as fiery warmth surged through Pat's body. Finally, they couldn't stand the tension any longer and broke away from each other.

"We better get breakfast started before we start something we can't finish," John said awkwardly, trying unsuccessfully to get his hard on to settle down.

"I know you're right, but I feel so impatient," Pat complained. "So, let's go down to the water together, remember I'll change more quickly in your presence."

"Good idea," John thought, "we can spend the day at the beach just having fun, for once, rather than doing research."

They both walked down to the beach, and John hunted fish while Pat looked for fresh seaweed and other edibles that may have washed ashore during the night. They spent the day in or near the water, keeping out of the sun in the beach huts that they had rebuilt after the tsunami, cooking the fish over an open fire, and swimming for fun rather than to catalogue species. They were both much more interested in the experiment they were engaged in than the original work they had come to the island to do.

Pat recognized the continual power of the goop as the day progressed. He often sought the water because his hips hurt so much, and it felt nice to get off his legs and just float in the water. Both Pat and John were floating in the late after noon when Pat felt an odd pulling in his groin and groaned in surprise.

"What is it? Did something bite you," asked John.

"Ahhh, no ... it's .... Oooooh, that feels so strange," Pat moaned. "Something is happening in my lower intestine."

John sat up in the shallow water and reached over to Pat.

"Wow ... you're really changing," remarked John. "Your hips are much wider and your penis is nearly gone. I can barely see it."

"I could have told you that, but I think this goop is much stronger than I suspected," explained Pat. "I think my organs and bones are being broken down and rebuilt much faster than normal metabolism would account. And it hurts ... aaaaaah," moaned Pat as he sat up.

John was astounded by what he saw. Pat had crossed a line from masculine towards feminine from which there now seemed to be no return. Pat's entire musculature had shrunken, and his features had become delicate and pretty.

Pat looked down at his changing body, intimately aware of each shift in his body. He swore could feel a slow steady compression of his waist even as his hips were inexorably expanding. Despite the discomfort, his whole body felt alive with electricity and energy. He looked at John with feral eyes, devouring the hunk of manhood who floated next to him. He noticed that John's shoulders seemed wider, more muscled, and his hips seemed narrower. His cock was astounding! It was hard and erect, poking above the surface of the water, apparently at least nine inches long and as thick as his wrist.

Pat reveled in the intensity of the growing desire the knotted itself in his stomach. He had never felt this way about anything, and he was thrilled that he could feel this way. He simply wanted John, wanted to smell him, touch him, and devour him. Pat leaned forward and grasped John's magnificent cock. It throbbed in his smaller hand, pulsing with John's pounding heart. Each pulse sent a thrill through Pat's hand and up his arm and through his body. He could feel the goop doing its work.

John watched, fascinated, as Pat held his pulsing cock in his/her hand. Pat began stroking his cock, and John knew he wouldn't last long.

"You won't have to do that for very long, Pat, I'm close to losing it," panted John.

Pat was thrilled by the look of desire burning in John's eyes. He couldn't see himself, but he was sure that he looked more female than male. He certainly felt more female than male, and he had a sudden inspiration to help speed the process.

"Come here," urged Pat as he pulled John up onto the beach by his rampant cock. He soon positioned John on the sand and knelt before him. John noted that Pat had a classic female shape, and that his/her legs folded up underneath wide thighs that flowed into a very nice set of hips and plump firm ass. His/her waist sharply indented above the hips and then flowed back out gently into a small rib cage and delicate shoulders. Pat's nipples seemed darker and slightly puffy, but no other significant changes could be noted. Pat's hair was long, thick, and soft, and framed a face that was now clearly feminine and beautiful.

"What are you doing," asked John.

"Speeding things up," replied Pat as he lowered his head down to John's lap and took his cock in his mouth.

The salt of the sea mixed with John's own sweat and musk and Pat found the combination intoxicating. He moved his head up and down with vigor, remembering how he liked his own, now nearly gone, cock stroked when he masturbated. John's breathing quickly grew ragged as Pat assaulted his stiff cock. Pat marveled at the feelings of having that velvet head push past his lips and feeling the raging hardness underneath the soft skin of John's cock. Pat opened his throat and took all nine inches of cock inside his mouth and slightly bit down at the base of John's cock, his nose buried inside a thick mat of public hair.

"Aaaaaah," John moaned as he exploded in Pat's eager mouth. Pat felt the warm cum gush down his throat, and he pulled back slightly so that he could catch the rest in his mouth. His strategy worked, and as he sucked slightly and swirled his tongue around the tip of John's cock, John let loose a second eruption equal to the first. Pat savored the salty, musky flavor of his best friend's cum, and sat back to wipe the small amount of cum from his/her lips that had some how escaped Pat's eager efforts.

"That was fun," Pat observed.

"Fun, you had fun?" a stunned and recovering John asked.

"Yea, I did ... I told you that goop was strong stuff. I couldn't have done that last night, but I couldn't have stopped myself today," explained Pat. "I'm pretty sure that the goop works nearly the same in fish as humans, which means I need another dose as I haven't had any since this morning. Those fish just produce it themselves."

Pat gave John's cock one last caress and started to head back to the mountain lab. John grabbed the fish and seaweed they had collected during the day and caught up as they entered the late afternoon jungle. As he watched Pat walk up the path ahead of him, there was no way he could still call his old buddy a 'he.' Pat's figure was astounding, with long sexy legs that led up to a world class ass, full and firm, topped with a very thin waist, delicate shoulders and arms, and a full, rich head of feminine hair that fell to the middle of 'her' back. Despite the recent orgasm on the beach, John could feel the stirrings of lust again as he watched Pat's hips sway back and forth as she made her way up the mountain path.

Pat for his part had also made the gender switch in his/her head. She was certain of her direction, and hyper conscious of her body. She could feel her hips swing back and forth and her widened bone structure demanded a different stride. She could feel her thick and lustrous hair sweep along her shoulders and back. She could feel how light and delicate her arms and hands felt, and she could feel that something was happening in her groin. She was certain that she wanted it to happen ... the sooner the better as John was getting all the satisfaction, and she recognized how horny she was feeling.

They made it back to the huts and Pat immediately fixed another large dose of goop mixed with punch while fixing a punch with only a little bit for John. She handed him the mug, and offered a toast.

"Here's to tomorrow morning," smiled Pat.

"Tomorrow?" asked John.

"Tomorrow, if my calculations are correct, will be the day that you stop being the only one who is enjoying himself," said Pat.

"Oh, I'm sorry ... but ... I mean ... is there ... jeesh, what should I do?" stumbled John?

"Drink up!" answered Pat.

They both tossed back their drinks, and Pat quickly assembled a dinner of fish and fruit. She was ravenous, and she suspected that the demands of her speeded up metabolism were to blame. After dinner, they decided to head for the hot tub again.

As John watched Pat slip into the water in the evening dusk, he noted that Pat's nipples were now very prominent, looking similar to a young girls'. Everything about her was female, and her crotch looked like a vagina in the darkness, with a classic 'v' of pubic hair above a puffy Venus mound.

Pat noticed John's gaze and waded to him, until she was standing over his reclined form. She reached down and grasped his hard cock.

"Does this thing every go down?" she teased?

"It's never done this before," answered John, "and it's never been this big either."

"Another gift of the goop, I suspect," mused Pat.

She continued to hold only John's cock, feeling the water lapping at her now very sensitive skin. Her waist was just at water level, and she could tell that her whole body was nearly done changing. She stood up so that the water came to the base of her hips, exposing her crotch to the air. "It's moving inside me ... I can feel it," Pat breathed as both she and John watched the tiny remnants of a cock was absorbed into her Venus mound, looking more and more like a clit. Incredibly sensuous feelings washed over Pat, forcing her wide hips to rock back and forth above the water. John could see that a vagina now occupied the now wide space between her legs, covered with a soft down of auburn pubic hair.

If possible, Pat felt John's cock get even harder and thicker, and he knew where that cock should go, but she knew she wasn't finished. Without letting go of John's cock, she threw a leg across John's startled face, and slid herself onto that beautiful pole of man meat. John's cock twitched as Pat rubbed her soft pubic hair against his cock, trapping his man meat between her undeveloped vagina and his washboard stomach.

Slowly and sensuously, Pat rocked back and forth, sliding her new anatomy across John's cock. The water from the hot tub provided the lubrication, and Pat could feel the stirrings of her womb, rushing to complete itself ... to accept this monstrous cock within. John's hands traced the graceful curve of her hips up to her waist and then across her now very puffy nipples. She gasped as his rough hands grazed her stiff nipples. She looked down, and saw that they were much larger than this afternoon, and the areola looked to be about one inch in diameter and the nipple was the size of her pinky. There was only about an inch of flesh behind each nipple, a small A cup. Nevertheless, John's touch was electric.

John leaned forward, took a nipple into his mouth, and gently bit down. Pat nearly passed out with pleasure, grabbing his head and pressing it into her developing breasts. Her rocking hips grew more urgent, and suddenly John stiffened and groaned in pleasure. Pat felt his white hot cum splash on her stomach and thighs. They stayed entwined in the hot tub for several minutes, feeling each other's body in the warm evening air as the warm water slowly washed them clean.

"I cannot wait until tomorrow," Pat growled.

"Maybe I can help," offered John.

"No, I want to do it right ... and I can wait ... hell, I haven't had any kind of sex in a long time, and it can wait one more day," mused Pat.

"So, I guess it's Patricia now, eh?" asked John.

"Almost!" laughed Pat, "But you should keep calling me Pat ... I like it. Keeps me from getting confused. I'm still me, if you know what I mean."

"No, I haven't changed the way you have, but I'll still keep calling you Pat," said John.

"Good, what do you say we go to bed?" asked Pat.

"That's a great idea," said John, as they rose from the tub together.

They walked back to John's hut arm in arm, with John's hand resting on the top side of Pat's wide and womanly hips.

"Oh, that's odd," said Pat.

"What's odd?" asked John.

"I can feel my breasts bouncing as I walk," reported Pat. "This is the first time I can remember feeling conscious of them, though I've noticed all day that they have been constantly but slowly growing."

"How's it feel?" asked John.

"Good, I think." Said Pat. "I mean, I've never had breasts before, but I like the fact that I'm growing them, and that tomorrow you'll be even more attracted to me."

"I couldn't be more attracted to you than I already am," protested John.

"I can't wait until I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen," teased Pat, "and you'll be helpless before me, my pleasure slave!"

"Hey, I thought the male was the dominant gender of the species," said John.

"All males think so, but I'm learning it's different!" said Pat. "I love the way I feel, the way I make you feel, and the way I'm changing. You forget, I know what a man feels when he sees a beautiful woman, and I'm going to enjoy being that powerful!"

"Oh, I'm doomed," cried John.

"Yea, doomed alright," teased Pat. "You will be stranded in paradise with the woman of your dreams who will want to make love to you day and night. That sounds pretty rough to me."

"I can't take it any more, let's get you to bed," said John.

They tumbled into bed and quickly fell asleep entwined together in the cool night air. During the night, the goop continued its work, and when Pat woke in the morning sun, she knew she was complete.

Pat got up and walked over to the mirror and looked down at her slender and feminine torso, and noted that her nipples had expanded well beyond their previous size. Her areolas were the size of silver dollars and her nipples were about an inch above the surface of her skin. Her waist was even narrower, and her vagina was dripping down her thigh. She was powerfully horny, and she knew it.

John stirred awake and saw a goddess standing before a mirror admiring her figure. She was tall for a woman, and looked like a 36D chest, an amazing 22 inch waist, and probably 38 inch hips. Her long hair reached to her lower back, and her skin was smooth and pale despite yesterday's sun. She brought her hands up to her breasts and weighed each in one hand. She giggled and turned to see John staring at her.

"Like what you see?" she asked

"Oh, my god," he breathed.

"I can't tell you how good these feel," Pat moaned as she continued to stroke her breasts.

"Why don't you let me feel for myself?" he teased.

Pat sashayed over to the bed, enjoying how her body moved and jiggled in places that her body had never jiggled before. John's cock had risen to its full hardness and stuck up at a funny angle from his crotch. Pat stopped at the end of the bed and leaned down on all fours, and she began to crawl up John's body. She dragged her full breasts against his legs as she licked and then gave a quick tug on his cock with her mouth. Pat loved the way her breasts felt as they rubbed against John's hairy legs. Her nipples were almost painfully hard, and each bump or snag of her nipples along his legs sent a thrill of pleasure racing along her body to her crotch.

She snaked her way up his body, raining kisses along his stomach and chest. When she could feel her own nipples pressing into his, she lifted up and kissed him hard on the mouth, their tongues battling each other. God, she was so hot. Her womb seemed to throb with need, an ache that had to be filled. She was literally dripping in his crotch as she humped his leg.

Suddenly the white heat that had been building surged in through her body. Pat could feel electric sparks pass between John's lips and her own. She could take it no longer and suddenly felt a crashing wave of pleasure roll up through her body, her pelvis rocking against John's in successive jolts of involuntary movement. Her first orgasm! It seemed to go on, and on, each wave more intense than the previous. She sat up and rode out the finish of the incredible pleasure that she had never known. As the last waves of pleasure pulsed through her body, she reveled in that part of her body that jerked and jiggled after her passion had peaked.

Her breasts.

Her chest sloped away from his shoulders in twin peaks of pleasure, ending in prominent nipples that ached with desire. John began sucking on her right breast, and Pat brought her hand to the left breast. She ran her hand lightly under the swell of the breast, noting that there was at least four or five inches of flesh that extended beyond her ribcage. The breast was heavy but firm, and very soft and yielding. Her nipple was stiff in the air, the sweat she had just generated dripping from it's upturned tip. She pinched the nipple and was rewarded with a jolt of pleasure that shot to her groin and back to her compressed nipple.

Pat gently lifted John's head away from her breast and looked deeply into his eyes. "Now, we can make love," she said, as she reached down and positioned John's cock below her dripping opening. She slowly eased down on his cock, feeling her new flesh being stretched by the invading pole. Inch by inch, John's cock slowly disappeared inside her steaming crotch. Suddenly, there was a catch. Something was in the way.

"Go easy, you're a virgin," said John.

"Not for long, damit," growled Pat, "I've been waiting for this moment for a long time." With that, she plunged her hips down is a sudden swift thrust.

The first jab of white-hot pain was immediately replaced by a thick, warm, fullness, and Pat could feel the top of John's cock press up against the top of her cervix.

"Ooooooh," Pat moaned with pleasure, "That feels soooooooo goooooooood." She placed her hands on John's massive shoulders and leaned back, looking at their joined hips below. "I've never felt this way before," Pat suddenly giggled at the irony of that statement. "I can't believe how good it feels."

"Oh, baby, it's nothing like the way I feel," John breathed, his body rigid with passion, "I've never felt anything so tight and hot in my life."

"Yea, me too. I can feel your thick cock up inside me, and I can," Pat grunted as she put words and action together, "squeeze you with my cunt."

She began to rock her hips, and reveled in feeling the slow shake of her feminine ass as it jiggled and shook with each roll of her hips. She could feel John's cock stroke in and out of her hot and wet cunt, her stiff clit rubbing against the thick pubic hair of John's crotch. She knew she wouldn't last long.

"Look at me, John, I'm complete. I am a woman ... your woman. Look at my breasts, my huge, firm breasts, see how my nipples are stiff with desire, desire that only you can satisfy. Feel them .... Aaaaahhhh, that's right, pinch ... ooooohhhh the nipples. Oh, John, I want you to cum in me, I'm going to cum ... I'm ... going ... to ... ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, uh, uh, uh," Pat's body shook with pleasure as she felt John's hot cum splash deep inside her. Pat couldn't stop screaming or shaking as the long, powerful orgasm kept pulsing through her body, her breasts shaking forcefully with each jolt. John held on to her tiny waist for dear life, pumping his seed into her twitching cunt.

They held each other for a long time, and Pat thought as she gave John's softening cock another squeeze with her still new and wonderful vaginal muscles. Now, she really didn't care at all when or if they ever got rescued.

### 02 - Daniel's Story

The sinking sun set the sand afire with golden light, which made the beach a beacon of hope for Daniel Sherman, ex-womanizing-drug runner. The thugs sent to kill him hadn't quite finished the job. They had done plenty, however, and Daniel's broken leg was thanks to the "helping hand" he got over the edge of his own boat. Although he was a strong swimmer, he had been in the water for hours, and was nearing exhaustion and a mild case of hypothermia, despite the warm, tropical waters.

One good thing about being in the water, thought Daniel to himself, was that he wasn't putting much weight on his broken ankle. It hurt like hell, especially when he was trying to kick, but he wasn't going to let that stop him. He had caught the glint of a shoreline twenty minutes earlier and was expending the last of his rapidly diminishing energy trying to reach it. Once he had made it past the barrier reef, the going was much smoother, and he made significant progress despite his injured leg.

The single peak of a slightly smoldering volcano dominated the small island before him. He had no idea where he was, as he had been bound and gagged in the hold of his own ship for several days. Although a slight man, he had always been athletic and adventuresome. His excellent physical condition was the only thing that had allowed him to survive this long. His captors had been a rival drug cartel, and he had been moving various drugs among the South Pacific islands for several years, disguising his efforts as a charter business. While he generally did well with the charters, mostly deep sea fishing, his real money was in drug running. It had all started with an ex-girlfriend, but that was a long time ago and a completely different story. He continued because he needed the money, and running drugs paid good money.

Ah, the price of success, he thought ironically. He had attracted the attention of a new, particularly nasty drug lord who didn't much like independents operating in his area. Daniel, who never liked carrying firearms, was an easy target. He supposed that he should be grateful that the killers wanted the excuse that he had fallen overboard on one of his own charters. That was a laugh! He had thought he was smarter than letting strangers pay cash for a fishing charter in the offseason; why didn't he see that one coming? Feeling that spark of anger helped him push for the beach. Whatever his moral shortcomings, Daniel Sherman was a survivor, and survive he would!

At first glance the island looked deserted, but he thought he heard voices, moans and squeals actually. But he was too exhausted to lift his head out of the water for a better look or to listen more carefully, and was about to give up when he felt sand in his hands and dragged himself up onto the beach. He passed out before he realized that he was only twenty yards from a beautiful couple who were making love in the setting sun.

It had been about a week since the amazing transformation that had changed Patrick into Patricia, and neither John nor Pat could believe their changed lives. Their island laboratory originally set up secretly to document changes to native species caused by the now forty year old nuclear tests held nearby had now become their island paradise. After nearly three months on the island, they had collected an impressive amount of evidence and made some new scientific discoveries.

The most notable had been the one that apparently caused Pat's transformation. A small painted shellfish that lived in all-female harems had a specialized gland that allowed, upon the death or loss of the male, the largest female to change her sex into male and become the leader of harem. Pat had synthesized the secretions to create a healing salve that made short work of any wound they suffered, but it also changed Pat into a woman. Neither man/woman was complaining, however.

They had both turned aside thoughts of rescue in the wake of the wonderful new and invigorating relationship they now shared: lovers. Pat reveled in her new gender, and enjoyed the sense of power and sensuousness that her beautiful body gave her. Her new skin was more sensitive than her old, she enjoyed sex, and she seduced John several times a day, not that he needed much seducing. Both were amazed at their stamina and sexual drive, and they attempted to push their bodies to the limits. They hadn't apparently found them yet.

This particular day had been much like the five previous ones. They woke in the bed they now shared with one of them instigating sex. This morning it had been John, and Pat had reveled in the long, slow teasing John had inflicted on her body. She awoke to a nuzzling on her breast to discover John suckling her up thrust nipple. Her breasts were magnificent globes of flesh that sat high and proud on her chest. Her nipples had continued to mature after the initial change, and they now were easily a half-inch long, sitting on slightly domed areola, at the end of her D cup breasts. She was almost always erect, and as a former man, she particularly enjoyed the delightful feelings of tightness at least six inches from her ribs. It pleasantly reminded her of a hardon.

John teased first one rosy nipple, then the other as Pat lazed on her back, her breasts rising above her reclined body without any need for support, only slightly sagging off to each side. She wondered how long her new breasts would sit so high, before gravity took over and began to pull them towards the earth. She had no clothes, no bras, and she knew that women couldn't fight gravity forever. For the moment, however, it was an academic question, as John moved slowly down her trim waist, raining gentle kisses over the swell of her womb, along the bony outcroppings of her wide hips, along her silken thighs and down to her toes. She gasped as he sucked a toe into his mouth, and she let her knees fall to each side, exposing her steaming sex to her lover.

John wasted no time working his way back up her legs until he reached her labia, pulling each expanding petal into his mouth while savoring her musky, sweet sent. She was the most beautiful woman he had ever known, and she was insatiable. Pat's hips were now twitching with need, and John refused to make contact with her swollen clitoris. She twined her fingers in his thick, curly hair, urging him to finish her off, cooing and begging. John gave a quick swipe of his tongue up along the joint of her thigh and Venus mound, causing her to whimper in frustration.

"John, don't tease any more ... give it to me," urged Pat. Her right hand reached down and grasped John's hard cock while her left closed over his neck and pulled his face up to her breasts. Up and down the length of John's cock Pat's fingers stroked while she lost herself in the wonderful feelings that John was drawing from her breasts with his lips. She kept trying to push his cock into her twitching cunt, but he held back, denying her.

Pat's long nipple suddenly chilled as John's sucking mouth left it. He slid his hands over her firm smooth legs stopping at the sides of her magnificent butt.

"Anxious aren't we?" he asked.

"Why are you doing this to me?" she countered, her breath coming in quick gasps.

"Perhaps good things will come to those who are patient," he teased.

"Cum indeed, you bastard, " she moaned, "stop teasing me!"

"Relax, let me do it," he promised.

She let her thighs fall further apart and placed her hands on John's flanks, waiting for his next move. He held her hands tightly at her sides, and then kissed his way back to her crotch. As John licked and teased her pussy, he let go of her hands and let his fingers begin to stroke over the folds of her labia and probe between the wet lips into the hot tunnel beyond. Pat became more moist and hotter, and John put another finger in next to the first. He finally sucked Pat's swollen clitoris between his lips and tugged on it gently. She gasped in pleasure as a lightening bolt ran through her body. P at lifted off the bed, shaking with her well-deserved orgasm, while John focused on keeping it going as long as possible. He held on for dear life and Pat screamed as her body shook wildly in her release.

When she finally stopped moving, he lifted her knees toward her breasts and spread her thighs. As Pat looked down past her heaving breasts, she had never felt so open and vulnerable. How different from her feelings as Patrick, she thought, and what's more, she loved it! She loved being passive, sexy, and desired. She loved the feeling of ache in her belly as she waited for John to fill the void she now possessed.

Pat sighed contentedly as John closed the distance between his loins and hers. John stroked the tip of his cock up and down the length of Pat's open slit. Each stroke opened the petals of Pat's flowering sex a bit further and smeared her moisture over the head of John's cock. Finally, positioning the head of his cock directly before the opening of her vagina, John applied the beginnings of the slow forward thrust. They both moaned with pleasure at the first passage of the tip of John's cock past the swollen petals of Pat's cunt.

Pat closed her eyes as she savored the still new sensation of the tip of John's cock slipping between her new equipment. More and more open her lower lips were spread as they wrapped themselves around John's big thrusting penis. Further and further her cunt stretched open around the head of John's cock. The ridge of his cock passed beyond the tight ring of her birth canal and the long, hard shaft began to slide into her body.

Pat could feel John's cock as it opened and filled her. It felt so good! John had done his preparatory work well, as usual, and she focused on the magnificent fullness inside her and the incredibly good feeling of her cunt lips rippling back and forth as John's cock moved slowly from the depths of her cunt to a point just barely nestled between her cunt lips and back again.

John focused on the exquisite feelings of Pat's velvety warmth gripping his cock. She was so warm, soft, wet, and snug. Pat clutched his broad shoulders and wrapped her long, sexy legs around John's thrusting hips. As his thrusts became deeper and faster Pat responded with her own more desperate thrusting against John's hard, driving cock. Her breasts rocked and shuddered as John's pile driving piston flew back and forth within her.

John grunted and drove his throbbing cock as far as he could into her, and rounded the corner towards the finish line. Pat, sensing John's imminent release, clamped down even harder with her new muscles, determined to give John the best fucking she could. John reared back suddenly and squirted his release into her. Pat ground her clit against the base of John's cock and felt her second release shudder through her. She cried out as her second orgasm flooded over her carrying her to places she had never dreamed of prior to a few days earlier.

Relaxing in the afterglow, Pat slowly stroked the back of John's neck, enjoying his weight on her as he lay atop her exhausted by their lovemaking. She felt his deflating prick as it slowly slipped from within her.

They were making love for the fourth time that day, on the beach, in the evening sun, when they discovered that they were no longer alone.

The sandy-haired stranger on the beach was barely alive, but Pat insisted that they could not use the goop on him.

"John, we don't know what it will do to him," she argued. "We can't take the chance that we will harm another."

"But he might die if we don't do something," countered John. "The goop made us both the picture of health."

"Yea, but it also changed me into a woman," Pat reminded him. "Not that I'm complaining, lover, but he," indicating the unconscious man who lay in Patrick's old bed, "might not find the journey to womanhood so enjoyable."

"But he is barely alive, and looks like he got several gashes and cuts from the coral reef and either a broken ankle or a real nasty sprain," John insisted. "Let's at least use it on his injuries."

"But even that small amount is what started us on our journey. We can't, we shouldn't do it," Pat said. "Some men might consider it a fate worse than death to become a woman, and though I'd like to educate them that it's actually quite wonderful, thanks in part to you my darling man, not all men could handle it."

"There's something else," John warned ominously.

"What?" asked Pat.

"Remember how those fish had harems?" asked John.

"You're not suggesting that you would sacrifice someone else's life to one of your wants?" asked Pat.

"No, no ... not that," John slowly stammered. "It's just ... well, just that I'm feeling, I don't know ... aggressive."

"Aggressive? How do you mean?" queried Pat.

"You know that I don't normally like to fight, right?" asked John.

"Yes, though you never shied away from one once you found that it was one of a few limited choices," she admitted.

"I can tell that if he wakes up, I'll have a hard time not being jealous or aggressive ... I don't know, because I've never felt anything like this feeling, and I think it's the goop," John reported.

"Are you serious?" asked Pat.

"Dead serious," replied John, "And I really don't want to hurt him, but with that fish goop running through our veins, I couldn't promise anything."

"I think you have got more human blood than fish goop, but let's set that aside for the moment," said Pat. "We have got to find a way to save him without harming him or us."

Pat furrowed her brow in concentration, but the stranger struggling to say something ended the argument.

"Wauuurrhgh," Daniel moaned.

Pat peered down to the stranger's face and examined his features for some signs of life. "I think he's trying to say something," she concluded.

"Waddderrrrrr," moaned Daniel.

"What did he say?" asked John.

"Water, I think," replied Pat. "Go get some water for him."

John ran to the main hut to get some water while Pat washed the stranger's face with a damp cloth for the tenth time that night. They had quickly lashed together some poles and made a stretcher to carry the unconscious man up to her old room. His breathing was shallow and labored, but he had at least looked better once they had cleaned off the sea and sand. Pat surmised that he was about their age, early thirties, or younger and looked to be in good shape. That had probably saved his life, as he must have been in the water for a long time.

John returned with the water and held it to his lips as Pat cradled the stranger's head in her hands. Daniel sputtered and coughed, but he finally got down some water. After a few minutes and a few more sips of water, he seemed able to speak, but he couldn't lift his head from Pat's hands.

"Better ... that's better," Daniel sighed.

"You gave us quite a scare," said Pat.

"How long?" asked Daniel

"How long what? How long were you unconscious?" asked John as Daniel turned his barely open eyes towards the sound of another man's voice and nodded slightly. "We found you on the beach about five hours ago, brought you back to this hut and cleaned you up a bit."

"Thanks," said Daniel. "I've actually been listening to you for the past half hour, but I didn't let on I was awake because ..."

"Because what?" demanded Pat feeling offended.

"Because I didn't know if I could trust you," finished Daniel fixing his eyes on John.

"Trust us?" asked Pat.

Daniel slowly swiveled his eyes back to her. "Yea, how do you think I got to your beach, an afternoon swim gone bad?"

"We really didn't think about it. We were just so surprised to be interrupted," said Pat. John cleared his throat, suddenly. "At dinner, interrupted while we were preparing dinner," she corrected herself, blushing.

"Oh, don't worry. I don't remember anything after the first fistful of sand I grabbed on the beach," said Daniel. "Oh, my name is Daniel. Daniel Sherman."

"I'm Pat, and this is John," said Pat.

"So what is this miracle goop that will make my injuries heal?" asked Daniel.

"You heard all that?" asked Pat.

"Yea, and I can tell you I'd take almost anything to ease the pain in my leg right now, even if it changed me into a woman," stated Daniel.

"Does your leg hurt?" asked Pat.

"I'm pretty sure that my ankle is broken," stated Daniel.

"I told you so," said John with a smug grin.

"This goop is likely to do more than just heal your injuries," warned Pat. "It will likely alter your mind and body, and either you and John will duke it out, or you and I will compete for John's attention, if you know what I mean."

"I think I understand the risks, and to tell you the truth, I never much liked competing in a man's world anyway. I don't seem to be much good at it. Secondly, Daniel Sherman is a dead man one way or the other, and third, my leg is killing me. I'm willing to take my chances with the goop," concluded Daniel, finding it harder and harder to talk.

"It's your choice," said Pat.

John had already gone to the adjoining hut to get the goop. He handed it to Pat.

"I'm going to give you some in a fruit drink we make to disguise the taste, and then put it directly on your cuts and ankle, O.K.?" asked Pat.

"Fine, but hurry ... I'm afraid I'll pass out again from the exhaustion and pain," said Daniel.

He downed the mixture of goop and punch while Pat dabbed the undiluted goop on his visible cuts and bruises. She lathered a generous amount around his ankle.

"There, that should do it," she stated.

"Thanks ... I'm ... uuuhhhhh," mumbled Daniel as he fell into unconsciousness.

"Well, that takes care of that," said Pat.

"Or, it's just the beginning," said John.

John and Pat were talking over breakfast after checking on their still sleeping guest.

"He didn't change very much, so you were worried for nothing," said John.

"His color looks better, and the swelling in his leg is gone. So, the goop works as advertised even when the injury isn't an external wound or cut," countered Pat. "But I didn't change much either, on the outside, at least at first while we were avoiding each other. The first changes were inside my head."

"Well, I'll stay away from him while he recovers," offered John, "that should help keep things neutral."

"We can try, but I don't think that will make a difference," said Pat.

"Are you angry or jealous that there might be another woman on the island?" asked John.

"I don't know, but I have enjoyed having you to myself for the past week," Pat said while reaching across their small table to caress John's hardening cock. "But since that might be about to change, why don't we take advantage of our guest's nap?"

They did. Twice. Two hours later Pat finally checked in on Daniel.

"Hey, you finally awake?" asked Pat as she offered Daniel some water.

"Yea, and I can't believe how much better I'm feeling. That goop is a miracle drug," said Daniel.

"Yes, miracle is right. But I was serious last night about the warning," said Pat. "That goop will do more than simply heal you; it will change you."

"You have no idea how much good a change might do me," offered Daniel. He told her of his recent exploits as a charter captain nee drug runner; the glamorous life of a single man with fast money, a fast boat, and lots of fast women, and how all that came to an end when he found himself nearly dead on their beach. "I'm pretty sure that someone else will discover us here eventually, and word will get around. If Daniel Sherman still lives, I'm sure that he won't last for very long. Besides, it was never my idea to be a drug runner, but that 's another story."

"So, the prospect of turning into a woman doesn't frighten you?" asked Pat.

"No, not really. Why should it?" countered Daniel.

"I don't know. I've never really thought about it, and I can't say one way or the other how I felt about sex, homosexuality, or women before I changed because I was always so focused on my work. You, however, had quite a love life, boats, women, etc.," mused Pat. "You might not be able to keep John at bay."

"You might not be able to keep me at bay either," said Daniel.

"You mean you find John attractive already?" asked Pat.

"No, I mean that you might not be able to keep me at bay from you," said Daniel with a smile.

"What are you talking about?" asked Pat.

"Pat, you are one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, and I don't care if I'm a man or a woman, I don't think I could keep my hands off of you," said Daniel forthrightly.

Pat stood, in all her naked glory, in complete and utter silence and shock for a moment. She had never thought of that angle. Sure, she enjoyed her new body, and on the rare occasion that John had been busy spearing their dinner, she had masturbated herself to one of her more intense orgasms yet as a woman. If she enjoyed her own beauty and sensuousness, then why wouldn't she enjoy someone else's?

"The thought has some appeal?" asked Daniel.

"Now that you mention it," smiled Pat. "But I never had really thought about it before. What about John?"

"That's a question you'll have to answer, not me," countered Daniel. "I'm not his lover ... yet."

"I don't know if it is me or the effects of the goop, but I don't have a quiver of trouble about thinking about sharing John, especially since there is so much to share," she giggled. "In fact, the thought of having another girl around here is giving me a quiver of an entirely different sort! The original fish lived in harems, maybe we should too?"

Daniel smiled. "So, when do we start?"

"Looks to me as though we already have," countered Pat. "Your hair is already longer than it was last night, and how are your feeling, you know, sexually?"

"I think it should be pretty obvious by our conversation," offered Daniel. "I didn't think about it until you asked, but I guess that I have been fantasizing about John since I woke up."

"It's the goop; there's no avoiding the side effects," said Pat. "That will limit its eventual effectiveness if and when we get back to civilization. But at least you knew of the dangers before you took the goop."

"Perhaps when we get back, you'll find a way to make the healing work without the sex change?" asked Daniel.

"Perhaps. In the meantime, are you feeling up to getting out of bed?" asked Pat.

"Oddly enough, yes. That goop is amazing," said Daniel.

"Here then, drink up," said Pat offering him a bamboo mug filled with punch and goop. Daniel took the mug, offered her a toast and said, "Here's to a new life and some new lovers!"

"O.K. Let me try this again," said a very confused John. "You want me to dominate you for the next three days and turn you into a woman," he asked Daniel who nodded vigorously, "and you are willing to share me with the eventual her," he asked Pat who also nodded vigorously. "And if I don't agree, Daniel will walk to the other side of the island and try to stay away from us as much as possible," he finished.

"Right. I don't want to intrude, but fate has thrown us together, and as I've said to Pat, I could really use a change, a real big change!" said Daniel breathlessly. Dan was having a hard time controlling himself. Now that he had made the mental leap to embrace the coming transformation, he couldn't believe how strongly he was attracted to the tall, tanned, and muscled John. He could feel his breathing become shallow and quick, and he was hiding a hard-on beneath what was left of his shorts after his ocean swim. He hoped that it wouldn't make John uncomfortable.

"I know it's supposed to be every guy's fantasy, more than one girl, a deserted island, perfect health, etc., etc.," worried John, "but it's never been one of my fantasies."

Pat nudged Daniel a bit closer to John. "It's not important what your past fantasies were," she argued. "What's important is how you feel right now. Is there any chemistry between you and Danni?"

"Danni?" asked John.

"Yes, Danni," said Daniel. "I may not look it yet, but I'm going to be Danni sooner or later unless I meet a smaller man who I then dominate, which is possible given that most of these South Pacific islanders are shorter than I am."

Pat gave Danni another gentle shove as she watched John's nostrils flare, as Danni got closer. "He doesn't want to be a he, he wants to be a she. And I can promise you that I won't be the least bit jealous. I'll always be your first, at any rate. And, when the change is done, Danni and I can be a different kind of first for ourselves and you can watch."

"Now I know I am dreaming," laughed John.

"I thought you said that this wasn't your fantasy," teased Pat.

"I did, and it wasn't, but I AM only human," argued John.

"So, you'll do it?" asked Pat.

John put his arm around Danni and drew him into a hug. "I'll do it, thought I won't enjoy it."

"Right. Now I know that I'm dreaming," laughed Pat.

Danni, as he decided he would have to call himself to get used to the transition, nearly swooned when John had brought him close. Neither John nor Pat wore any clothes, and Danni had never had his own skin feel like it was afire when pressed to a naked man's chest. The chest his face was crushed against transfixed Danni. It was enormous, hard, and chiseled, lightly dusted with soft, downy tufts of hair that only seemed to highlight the valleys and peaks of John's magnificent chest. John's smell was intoxicating, dark and salty, and his arm felt like an iron bar that held him close and tight. Yes, he was going to like John.

Danni turned his head so that he could see Pat. She stood laughing with John, her bright green eyes sparkling in the sunlight and her thick auburn hair curling around her pretty face and cascading along her shoulders behind her back with one thick shank curled between her breasts. Her breasts shook with her laughter, bouncing slightly. Danni was equally enthralled with Pat's chest as well. Pat's breasts were large but high, topped with enormous nipples that must have been as big as his fingertips. Well, he thought to himself, I'm not going to have any trouble being attracted to either one of them. He hoped that he would be as beautiful as Pat.

"We should head down to the beach and spend the next few days at the old huts," said Pat.

"Why's that?" asked John.

"Because, as wonderful as the end result may be, the process actually hurts a bit," said Pat. "Not a lot," she reassured Danni, "but being in the water and off your legs helps as your hips and spine reshape themselves into a feminine form."

"Oh, well that makes sense," mused Danni. "No pain, no gain, after all."

"Well, trust me, soon-to-be-little-sister, there is plenty of gain," promised Pat as she gave her own breasts a caress.

The three of them spent the entire day at John and Pat's original beach hut, mostly swimming with John going off to spear some fish for meals while Pat showed Danni how to gather shellfish and edible seaweeds. Pat had urged Danni to stay as close to John as often as possible. John felt a bit uneasy at first, but the goop quickly worked its magic, first on their minds, and then on their bodies. Danni seemed to be suffering more physical pain than Pat remembered during her own transition, but Danni distracted himself by admiring Pat's magnificent figure. By the early evening, Danni had progressed to the same state Pat had acquired after her first two months of transition. Danni was not much shorter, having only been about 5'10'' to begin with, but he was much more slender. He had lost most of his male musculature, and his face had softened considerably. With the right tools and the right light, neither of which were on this island, he could easily pass for a woman.

As they prepared for their evening meal, they noticed some new developments.

"Pat, have you ever noticed these red patches on John's back?" asked Danni as he watched John's back in the firelight as he grilled their meal over the open flame.

"What patches?" asked Pat as she left her work on the hut they would sleep in that night and joined Danni who stood behind John.

"See these," she pointed to two long narrow patches of red skin that ran along the inside of John's shoulder blades about 12 inches long.

"Wow, I've never noticed them before," said Pat as she ran her fingers along the length of each mark.

"Hey, that tickles," said John.

"Oh, sorry. Are they that sensitive?" asked Pat.

"Why don't you tell me?" asked Danni as he ran his fingers along the marks he had found on her back.

"Oooooh, careful!" Pat squealed. "They are sensitive."

"What do you think it is?" asked John.

"I don't know, and I can't see in this light," said Pat. "Perhaps we will be able to see better in the morning."

"Perhaps we won't need to see better because it be done what ever it is doing," worried John.

"Both of you are taking more goop to assist me in my change, right?" asked Danni.

"Yes, I think the goop needs to be present in all the harem for the transformation to be effective," said Pat.

"Maybe you should stop," said Danni. "I don't want anything bad to happen to you."

"I knew that I liked her from the start," said John.

"You said 'her' ... wow," said Danni.

"Well, girlfriend, you're getting there," laughed Pat. "But you've got two more days until you're done, and we won't let you lie around halfbaked. I'm sure that it's not harmful, and I have a theory anyway."

"Theory? Well, then let's have it," said John.

"It's only a theory," said Pat.

"It was only a theory that got this goop invented in the first place, my beautiful-transformed-genius-lover," teased John.

"O.K. Here it is, I don't know if you're going to like it," said Pat.

"I thought that you said that it wasn't bad," said John.

"I did say that, but I didn't say that you would or would not like it," said Pat. "This is the first time that the two of us have spent the entire day, more or less, in the water, right?"

"Yes, but we spent most of the second day at the beach last week when you changed," countered John.

"But when you think about it, we were only in the water for a few hours, whereas today we must have spent eleven or twelve hours in the water, easy," said Pat.

"Yes, and it made me feel so much better, " said Danni. "I'm getting sore just standing here."

"You should lie down by the fire," said Pat. "We can finish getting dinner ready. So, my possibly-equally-transformed-genius-lover, are you beginning to see where I am going with this theory?"

"Gills?" asked John.

"Gills," said Pat.

The three of them sat in stunned silence for a few minutes.

"Do you think we are still human?" asked John.

"It depends on what you mean by human," said Pat.

"What's your definition?" asked John.

"I think we will still be able to produce children with people who haven't had goop, and gills are in our human genetic heritage," continued Pat. "But I don't think the ultra conservative religious types will think we're human."

"Hell, those types don't think that normal people who simply believe different things are human," joked Danni, "or ones that have sexual orientations other than straight. Gills will really throw them for a loop."

"Well, it's almost an academic question since we're still stranded here," said Pat. "We should, I think, allow this new twist to continue despite Danni's worries."

"Yea, it will be so much easier to fish," laughed John.

"You never seemed to have a problem before," joked Pat.

"I wasn't trying to feed three hungry mouths," said John.

After dinner, which had taken Danni three helpings to satiate his unusual appetite and included a healthy dose of goop for everyone, they decided that they would all sleep together on the floor of the hut. Pat had gathered fresh reeds, palm fronds, and made a large bower on the floor. The hut wouldn't keep out much, but it would shield them from the constant, cool breezes the washed in from the cooler water over the still warm land.

Danni lay down between them, and both Pat and John nuzzled against his neck. He was awash in the tingles and tugs that the goop was performing upon his transforming body. He already had a slight indentation of his waist, and his body hair had largely disappeared. His hips, which had been aching all day, were slightly wider, and his shoulders were slightly narrower. He now looked like a young, slightly androgynous, girl. But both John and Pat could tell he would be beautiful.

As they gazed down at the slightly smaller and more petite Danni as he lay between them, they both noted that his hair was a whiter blond at his roots and was now about four inches long. His lips had grown puffier, and his hands and feet were more delicate. Danni was still wearing the remnants of his male shorts, but they weren't going to fit on him/her much longer.

Pat leaned forward and let her breasts brush against Danni's chest as she nibbled on his ear. "You're going to be a beach blonde," she breathed into his ear.

"That will be nice, one blonde, one redhead," said John as he slowly stroked Danni's flanks with his hands.

"I don't know if I'm ready for much past kissing," breathed Danni.

"I know EXACTLY how you feel," teased Pat gently. "You can participate when you're ready," Pat continued as she lowered her face to Danni's.

When Pat's soft, full lips gently pressed into his own, Danni knew that he could hardly wait for this journey to be completed. Kissing Pat was unlike any experience he had ever known, in part, because his own lips were larger and softer than they had ever been before. Pat's tongue pried open his lips, and he let her slide her tongue over his teeth, delighting in her scent and taste. Danni wished that his own breasts had already grown so that they could rub sensuously against hers as they hung down from her slender frame, full, heavy, womanly breasts. Soon, he hoped, soon.

John's fingers were doing equally wonderful things to his sides and legs. Danni swore that he could almost feel his waist constrict each time John's fingers danced along his flanks. Pat lifted up from their kiss, her eyes shinning. "You're going to be a great kisser," she sighed.

"Let me try," said John as he lifted his face from the curve of Danni's softening shoulder.

Danni caught his breath, turning slowly to John's face looming over his. He knew that he barely looked like a girl, but that he was still very much a man as his cock was straining against his shorts. Pat silenced his worries.

"Oooh, what do we have here?" she giggled as she unzipped Danni's shorts and let his stiff, but shrinking, cock spring free. Before Danni could react, John had covered his mouth with his, and Pat had sucked his now much smaller cock into her mouth. Danni nearly passed out with pleasure, feeling the surges of the goop as it swept through his body under the dual assault of Pat and John. On Pat's second stroke, Danni erupted into Pat's mouth, as he moaned into John's.

"Well, looks like Danni is on a hair trigger," mused John as he sat up from his kiss. He looked down on the now swooning Danni, noting that his face had shifted even further towards the feminine with longer lashes, wider eyes, and graceful eyebrows. John wasn't sure, but perhaps Danni was moving more quickly than Pat had.

Pat continued to suck and clean Danni's small cock for several minutes while Danni continued to swoon, his eyes closed and arm entwined with John's.

"Well, I swear I could feel your cock getting smaller in my mouth," mused Pat. "Wow, your eyes are really blue!" she exclaimed as Danni finally opened his eyes.

"Really? That 's nice," Danni said as he reached for Pat and pulled her face to his own. "Blonde haired and blue eyed, how's that for you John?"

"I can't wait," said John as he indicated his throbbing hard-on that was now firmly poking into Danni's slowly feminizing thigh.

"Poor baby, maybe we should help," said Pat. "What do you say, Danni?"

Danni looked from Pat's shining hopeful eyes to John's throbbing penis. He knew that the opportunity presented in Pat's suggestion would hurtle him further towards his feminization. But he had only just kissed his first man, and his mind had not yet made the leap to female, though it was certainly getting there in a hurry. Pat scrambled around John and put him in the middle. She put her hips up by John's head and took his large tool lovingly in her small hands.

"Fair is fair," she teased as she twitched her hips with need and lowered her lips over the tip of John's cock and held it there lightly, smiling up at Danni and John.

"I suppose you're right," said John with fake annoyance. He shifted away from Danni and turned towards Pat's splayed legs and busied himself in her sweet muff.

"Ummmm, now that's more like it," she cooed as John nipped and licked at her leaking vagina. She took as much of John's cock into her mouth as she could and gave a long, slow pull along its length. John moaned into her crotch.

"You want a taste?" Pat asked Danni after John's cock popped from her mouth. "It's pretty tasty if you ask me."

"Um, maybe I'll just watch this time," said Danni.

"It will speed things up," said Pat. "I speak from experience."

"Are you sure," asked Danni.

"Honest to goodness," Pat said.

Danni paused, then sat up and positioned himself opposite Pat as she returned for another long pull on John's magnificent dick. It was thick and long, perhaps eight or nine inches; Danni wasn't sure. At his best, Danni's cock had only been five inches, but no one had ever complained. He had known how to use it properly. Despite his tenuous status as not a woman and no longer quite a man, Danni found John's cock fascinating. It throbbed visibly in Pat's grasp, and her lips stretched over the bell-like head and rippled as they slid over each bump and vein. She lifted her mouth from John's cock with a slight "pop" and pointed it at Danni's face.

Danni could feel an odd surging of emotion and tingling as he leaned towards John's cock. He almost didn't register that Pat had let go of the cock and had grabbed John's head in ecstasy, urging him to push her quivering clitoris over the edge and into an orgasm. Danni barely realized that he was holding the cock on his own, or that his lips had gently brushed across the tip, savoring the precum that had oozed out and was dripping down one side. Danni did, however, decide that it was now or never and swallowed John's cock in a forceful thrust that brought a low grunt from John. Pat's hips jumped as John's effort was spurred onward by Danni's sudden enveloping of his cock.

John's cock was tasty; Pat was right. Danni felt a surge of desire and emotion run through her body and soul. Pat was really right! This did speed things up, she realized that she had crossed her own gender barrier in her mind. With a newly inspired vigor and an old and wellearned, knowledge, Danni worked John's cock like a pro. Pat continued to twitch and coo, coming closer and closer to her release. John began grunting with each sudden pump Danni performed on his cock.

She moaned into John's crotch, feeling the higher vibrations of her own changed voice flow over both her equally changed teeth, lips, tongue and John's cock firmly lodged in her mouth. Pat finally reached her orgasm, whimpering with joy as wave after wave of pleasure surged through her pelvis and breasts and limbs. Danni sucked even harder, and John found his release too, spurting hot, salty cum into her eager mouth. She felt a sense of satisfaction that she had brought pleasure to some one else, the tangible proof of which she savored in her mouth.

Pat lifted Danni's face to hers and kissed her deeply, sharing the bounty of John's pleasure. Danni eagerly fenced with Pat's tongue and reached for her distended nipple that hung over John's deflating cock. Pat moaned in approval as Danni gently stroked her nipple, extending the still present but now fading pulses of her orgasm.

"See?" teased Pat as she broke the kiss.

"Yes, I see," said Danni, her eyes shining even bluer and her lips fuller.

"Ah, it really worked ... you've crossed over, haven't you?" asked Pat.

"Oh, yes, by God yes!" exclaimed Danni. "And I love it," she said as she reached up to stroke Pat's beautiful face. "I didn't expect to feel this way this quickly."

"It's the goop," replied Pat.

"It's the sleep," grumbled John. "Having one sexy woman was tiring enough. Having two will be something entirely different altogether."

"Bitch, bitch, bitch," teased Danni.

"Let's put you back into the middle," said Pat as she crawled over the entwined bodies. Danni was jealous of Pat's swaying breasts and large nipples as they brushed over John's waist and then her own still flat chest. Soon ... soon, she thought. Danni and Pat shared gentle caresses and more kisses as John quickly fell asleep next to them.

"Men," whispered Danni with a giggle.

"Yea, they have their uses," said Pat as she kissed her newest lover deeply, their tongues twisting and sliding past each other's. "You're going to need your beauty rest, darling, so let's get some shut eye."

They did.

In the morning, Danni awoke last and found Pat and John looking at her expectantly.

"What?" she asked sleepily.

"Definitely faster," John observed as Danni sat up and stretched.

"Yes, and I'm jealous," teased Pat. "She's going to be done today at this rate, a full day earlier than I was."

Danni looked down at herself to see what was the fuss.

My god, she thought. Her hair was now past her shoulders and her torso was clearly female. Her rib cage was much smaller, and her nipples were puffy and larger. Her waist seemed to have shrunk in half, while her hips had widened considerably. Her legs were now thin and feminine, and her toes were dainty and perfect!

Pat held out a mug. "Here ya go, a nice strong one!" she said with a smile.

Danni took the bamboo mug eagerly and slurped down her morning drink. When she finished, she traded Pat the mug for a small mirror she was holding.

"I thought you might find this useful over the next day or so," said Pat. "Though I didn't think you would need this until later today. You're about twelve hours ahead of me, and I'm not sure if it is the presence of both John and I or that we are further advanced ourselves or that you might be more sensitive to the compounds in the goop."

Danni stared in wonder at her reflection in the mirror. Her face was completely changed. Daniel Sherman was gone! Her eyes were bright blue, easily the match of Pat's bright green eyes. Her nose was small, cute, and delicate. Her lips were generous and wide and her teeth were large and strong. She smiled at herself.

"Sort of a cross between Julia Roberts and Jessica Simpson," said Pat.

"Wow, I didn't see that until just now," said John. "But you're right, only Danni's even prettier than either of them." Danni blushed at John's compliment.

"Let's eat breakfast and hit the beach," said Pat. "We can continue this outside."

As Danni bent her legs to rise, a ripping sound rent the air. "Well, that's the end of those shorts," she mused.

"No worries. We go naked and you can too," reassured Pat.

"But I'm not done," worried Danni.

John reached down and pulled to her feet. Her formerly male shorts had ripped most of the way down one seam. John grabbed the other seam with both hands and easily ripped the other side of the shorts open from top to bottom. He let the tattered pieces fall to the ground as the three of them looked at the changes to Danni's crotch. She was right, she wasn't done, but no one standing more than three feet away would be able to tell. Nearly all signs of her formerly male appendages were gone. The only remnant was that her clitoris was still looked like a tiny cock, though only about an inch long or less.

"Unless we get new visitors today who get up-close and personal, you've got nothing to worry about," reassured John.

"Well, you convinced me," laughed Danni, and they walked out into the morning sunlight arm in arm.

They spent another day in the surf, swimming further out into the lagoon. All three of them felt the effects of the goop on their bodies. Danni's skeleton stopped shifting and hurting by lunchtime, and Pat and John's red marks had grown into red stripes that seemed to be a clearly different texture than the rest of their skin. Their sensitivity had dropped as the change progressed, but nothing else had emerged. Pat insured that all three of them got strong doses of goop with lunch, and they returned to the water.

Late in the afternoon, after Danni had shared another blowjob with Pat, and then she had suckled Pat's breasts as John stroked Pat >from behind while they all floated in the shallow lagoon, Danni felt a tugging in her abdomen and moaned in discomfort.

"It's o.k. honey," reassured Pat. "It's your womb forming. You're almost there. Heck, your breasts are coming in faster than mine did," she observed as she noted Danni's expanding nipples and gentle slopes of her newly formed breasts.

Danni leaned back in the water as John supported her so she wouldn't sink. She could feel her insides rapidly reshuffling themselves into her new sex, and the anticipation she felt helped offset the sharp ache that lanced through her stomach and groin. John stroked her sides, holding her hips at water level while Pat supported her head between her breasts, stroking her hair. Danni was comforted by the weight on her chest that signaled the arrival of her breasts, though they were still only about a B cup, they nevertheless stuck straight up into the warm, early evening air, gently caressed by the waves as they lapped over her breasts and stomach. Her nipples were already long and stiff, and her bright, blond hair floated in a halo around her shoulders and face.

The discomfort lasted for almost a half hour, but the result was astonishing. The water that had been washing over her chest now could no longer reach her nipples. Her breasts had expanded even as her womb had formed. Danni now looked down from where her head was cradled in between Pat's large breasts. She could see that her own body's terrain had greatly changed. Her new breasts were not as large as Pat's, it seemed, but the nipples were very stiff and very sensitive. The warm salt water barely lapped at the sides of her bulging breasts, ebbed, and flowed over her completed vagina. Her hips had widened to the equal of Pat's, and her legs were smooth and long. Her vagina was topped with the barest tuft of white blond hair, and she could feel the dull ache of desire in her womb rather than the sharp pain of transformation. She was ready.

She looked back at Pat who had gently held her head above the water for so long, and parted her lips in anticipation of a kiss. Pat did not disappoint her, and she lowered her full, soft lips to Danni's wide, soft mouth. Their tongues dueled while Pat's hands wandered over Danni's breasts, plucking at her stiff and long nipples.

"I think the oven is done," observed Pat after she broke off the kiss from Danni.

"Let's stick a fork in her and see," teased John.

"Don't you dare stick a fork in me," warned Danni. "There's only one instrument I'm willing to accept into my body."

"Just one?" breathed Pat as she thrust her long tongue deep into Danni's mouth.

"Yummmmm, " moaned Danni. "Well, maybe more than one, but definitely not a fork."

"Would a nice hard prick do?" asked John.

"Yes, as a matter of fact, I think it would do nicely," said Danni as she rose from Pat's embrace.

John let Danni's hips sink into water in which he was standing and guided Danni as she turned to float vertically in the water next to him.

"I'm feeling water logged, and I want a better look at the final product," said Danni as she turned and stroked for the shoreline. John and Pat watched appreciatively as Danni's shapely ass broke the waterline and swayed back and forth with Danni's powerful strokes towards the beach.

"Last one in gets one less kiss," laughed Pat as she followed Danni's lead and headed for the hut. John watched in awe as two of the most shapely women he had ever seen, neither of whom had been women for very long, gave perfect Ester Williams' imitations and put feminine charms in water on perfect display. He wasted no time following both of them into the shore.

Danni reached the same shore she had only two nights earlier barely dragged (himself) onto, and strode with strong, swaying strides towards the hut that sat at the edge of the high tide line. She paid particular attention to her body, as it broke free of the water's support for the first time. Her breasts where almost as large as Pat's, but Danni was particularly glad that her nipples were larger and poked out from perfectly Champaign glass shaped, C cup breasts. Her breasts felt heavy on her chest, with just the right amount of jiggle. Her waist was thinner than Pat's, which she felt proud of, and her hips were generous without being too much of a good thing. She was nearly the same height as Pat, she noted as Pat strode out of the waves and walked towards her, her larger breasts rocking and swaying with her strides. Pat was a redhead, well, auburn at any rate, and Danni was a classic blonde. They made good bookends ... or John-ends ... she thought with a giggle.

Pat took in the vision of loveliness that stood in the dusk on the beach before her. Danni had turned out spectacularly. Danni was more petite than she was, but that did not worry her, as she knew that balance was more important than uniformity. She stood close to Danni and took her into her arms.

The kiss that Danni shared with Pat was the most electric kiss she had every known, man or woman as either man or woman.

"Look at your nipples," Pat teased. "You're so excited that they're sticking out an inch!"

"So are yours," Danni returned.

"Not an inch," she laughed. "Well, what are we going to do about it?"

Danni shrugged with a coy smile. A second later, Danni felt Pat's hand move from around her neck and start stroking Danni's thigh. Never in a thousand years could she have imagined that she would ever be a woman while another woman stimulated her sexually. Pat's hand snaked its way to Danni's wet crotch and she gasped with pleasure. She moved her own hand to Pat's equally wet pussy, and they stood there, their nipples brushing past each other, as they slowly stroked each other's pussy lips, cooing and sighing with the pleasure that they shared. They continued stroking each other as John walked from the water and stood, cock at full mast, watching their lovemaking.

"Let's get to the hut," breathed Pat.

"Yes, lets," agreed Danni.

Danni was no sooner in the hut when Pat pulled her into her arms and kissed her. She felt Pat's tongue enter her mouth and quickly slid her own out to meet it. Pat's hand quickly moved down Danni's gracefully curving back and slid down the back of her ass. Danni responded by pulling on Pat's nipples that were crushed between them.

Pat's breasts were heavier than Danni's, the nipples were rounder but not longer. Pat moaned into Danni's open mouth as Danni fondled her nipples. Danni's hand slid down to her hips and pulled Pat closer, working a thigh between her legs. She felt, for the first time, the cooling sensation of pussy juice dripping down on their legs. Danni wasn't sure if it was more her than Pat, but both of their vaginas were making squishy sounds as they humped each other's legs.

"Let's go in to the bed," Pat whispered as she pulled away from Danni. "John can join us in a bit," she continued with a wink to John.

"Don't worry about me," said John. "I could use the rest. I'll be ready for you when you two are ready for me."

Danni released Pat reluctantly and followed her into the bed. In the soft glow of the moonlight, they looked at each other. Two new women who were each aglow with their new found femininity.

Their pubic hairs were both lightly colored and gently curled, proof that they were both naturals. Small clear droplets of cum clung to their mounds.

Pat licked her finger and then traced up and down the center of Danni's bush. Her gaze was as exciting to Danni as the wet finger between her legs. Unable to wait any longer, Danni took hold of Pat and pulled her to the bower of reeds and palm fronds. It felt like a feather bed to the lovers.

They rolled back and forth, blonde and redhead, kissing deeply, nipples rubbing together, bellies touching and mounds grinding together. When Danni was on top, Pat slid her hands down her back and pulled hard against her. The other did the same as their positions changed. Danni then remembered a trick she saw once in a porno when she was still a man. She pulled Pat's plump cheeks apart, and then pushed them back together, rhythmically. Then she used her fingertips to tease her puckered anus. Pat moaned at the touch.

"Yes....Oh yes..." she gasped. "It feels so good."

Needing no more encouragement, Danni got up, knelt behind Pat, and teased her again. First with her fingers, then with her tongue. Danni buried it deep in Pat's rectum while she pumped two fingers in and out of her dripping pussy.

The incredible sight of Pat on all fours entranced John, her breasts swaying back and forth as she rocked back into Danni, who had her head buried in Pat's ass while her fingers pumped her wet pussy. John resisted the temptation to stroke his own cock, content to wait until it was his turn.

"That's it," Pat hissed, as she rocked back and forth. "So good! So damn good!"

Hearing Pat talk like that helped push Danni closer to the edge, but she was determined to hold back a little longer. She knew Pat was close, but she wanted it to build to a rousing climax. A few minutes later, she felt Pat's rectum clamp down on her tongue as her pussy pulsed around her fingers. She plunged her mouth into Pat's box and was rewarded a second later with an explosion of cum which saturated her face.

Danni hardly had time to recover her composure before Pat had recovered and maneuvered Danni onto her back. Immediately Pat had her face between Danni's legs and went to work on her. Danni couldn't believe how she felt! Her breasts jumped on her rib cage as her hips twitched at Pat's probing tongue. Her body felt alive with pleasure, and her hair softly caressed her shoulders and arms. She felt so female, so soft and pretty, and so close to an orgasm. Pat's head bobbed up and down as she tongued Danni closer and closer to her first female orgasm. Suddenly John reached over and began to stroke her breasts while Pat continued her assault on her cunt.

The dam broke, the clouds parted, the storm broke, and Danni experienced the singular pleasures of the female orgasm. It started with a white-hot surge through her abdomen that sent tendrils of pleasure to all her extremities, but most especially to her clit and nipples. The resulting aftershock as that pleasure coursed back towards her womb set off the explosion of a lifetime. Danni never felt such wonder, such power, and such passion. She clasped John to her breast and thrust her hips into Pat's eager embrace, screaming in pleasure, pulsing, pulsing, and pulsing.

Pat held on for dear life as she tongued Danni through one orgasm after another. Danni didn't know it was possible to cum so much. Pat seemed insatiable, unwilling to break contact with the woman that she had helped to create. John was equally helpful, suckling the long and stiff nipple that rose from Danni's heaving and quivering breast.

Finally, Danni could take no more and managed to pull Pat up from her jellied thighs and guide her face to her own. Danni kissed her, and then they spent long minutes licking cum off each other's faces, before John finally joined in to help them.

"That was wonderful," sighed Danni.

"That was only the start," teased Pat.

"What are you talking about?" asked Danni. "I can't imagine more pleasure than that!"

"Aren't you forgetting someone?" teased Pat.

"Oh, John," said Danni as she turned to face him. "I'd completely forgotten about you."

"Not to worry," teased John. "I hadn't forgotten about you!"

"But we have left you in quite a state," she said with a conspiratorial smile to Pat. "And now, I have ALL the equipment needed to take care of that," Danni as she leaned forward and took his hard cock into her mouth.

"Oh!" John exclaimed as he felt the warm softness engulf his cock. He focused on the ripples of delight produced by Danni's skillful tongue. If anything, his cock had grown even harder as he looked down and watched those soft red, feminine lips he had seen develop for the last two days now slide up and down his manhood.

Danni was a born cocksucker. With a skill that normally came from years of practice, she took John's nine inches deep into her throat. John had only had a few blowjobs before. None of those had felt like this, not even Pat's.

The wetness of Danni's mouth seemed to engulf his entire being. Her tongue was everywhere at once; licking up under the crown, tickling the sensitive area beneath his balls, massaging the sides of his cock as she took him all the way into her throat.

"Oh Danni ...." He moaned. John placed his hands against the back of Danni's head and began to thrust his cock into her mouth, worried that he would release too soon. He needn't have worried. Danni expertly held his balls with her free hand, delaying his climax. She could feel the fire building inside him, and knew exactly what John felt, and knew she could control it. It felt so good to have such power and insight.

Finally, she released her grip and Danni felt the first drops of hot cum splatter against the back of her mouth. Furiously pumping his cock with her hand, she opened wider and swallowed as much of John as she could. The salty white fluid filled her as she closed her eyes and savored the tangy taste.

It seemed like it would never end as he erupted a third and then a fourth time. The last burst as powerful as the first. Finally, the fifth spurt signaled the end as Danni slowed the motion of her head and gently began to lick the length of his cock clean.

She took a final lick of his now softening cock and let it slip from her mouth. She looked up at him, a very satisfied smile on her face.

"Did you enjoy that?" Danni asked as she stood up.

"Oh yes," John said as she reached her full height.

"Good," she purred like a cat that had just finished a saucer of milk.

"That was hot," said Pat as she reclined on their bower.

"I'm not finished," said Danni as she pressed her lips against John's, giving him a passionate kiss. The taste of his juices was still on her lips and when she reached into his mouth with her tongue, he sampled an even larger measure. She then broke away from John, and began to display herself to her two lovers.

John watched as Danni began to caress her beautiful body, sensuously displaying herself. She caressed her very large nipples and teased her already swollen labia.

"You can take a closer look now that they are finished," Danni said as she smiled and ran her fingers across her tits. "Touch them ... kiss them," she urged.

That did it for John. He could already feel his cock springing back to life. John cupped both breasts and moved his mouth to the closest nipple. He heard Danni sigh as he took it into his mouth and began to gently suck it. If it was one thing he had learned from Pat, it was how to suck a woman's breasts.

His tongue traced the outline of her aureole as his fingers massaged her other breast. He could feel the nipple growing harder in his mouth as he covered it with his warm saliva. He eased Danni onto the bower of palm fronds and began to kiss and lick his way across her chest until he came to her other nipple where he repeated his performance. Danni just laid back and closed her eyes, a happy smile beaming across her face.

"Ummm, breasts are nice." She murmured. "But I need to be fucked. I want you to fuck me hard!"

"Hard?" John repeated.

"Yes," She continued as he again took a breast in each hand and massaged them. "I want you to make me feel like a woman!"

John wasted no time in fulfilling her request. He eased her up onto on all fours. Taking a position behind her, John stroked his hard cock as he rubbed his cockhead against Danni's wet hole. As he rubbed his maleness up and down the length of her opening, Danni pressed her pelvis against his hardness, inviting him to enter her.

"Fuck me!" Danni cried out as she pressed against him. "I need you inside me so bad!"

"Give it to her, John!" urged Pat. "God, you're such a tease, trust me girl, I know." Pat squirmed under the two lovers and positioned her mouth beneath their union, offering her still quivering cunt to Danni.

John thrust forward and burst effortlessly past Danni' virginity and slid inside of her. As wonderful as Pat's mouth had felt on Danni's clit, it was nothing compared to the fullness that now pressed against her maidenhead. John gripped her hips firmly and began to develop his rhythm, one that Danni quickly matched, timing her gyrations to meet his forward thrusts. As the forward thrust of John's thrusts forced Danni forward, she leaned into Pat's waiting quim and shared the pleasure she was feeling from John with Pat.

Pat was tighter, but Danni was wetter, thought John as he savored their intense love making.

"Harder," moaned Danni urging John forward.

The pace quickened and John's thrusts became more insistent, each drive seeming to penetrate deeper than the last. Danni thrilled to the feelings as John slid his rock hardness almost all the way out, then pushed forward in a furious thrust until his balls slapped against her. She could feel her ass shake with each thrust and her breasts quivered wildly on her chest; her nipples were twin points of fire. Her mouth was crushed against Pat's cunt with each thrust.

"Fuck me, fuck me!" Danni panted as her sweat-covered body quaked in passion. "Fill me with your cock!"

Even though he had just cum only minutes previously, John knew he would soon erupt again. His own body was also covered with sweat, his breath labored under his efforts.

So wet had Danni's love canal become and so intense had John's thrusts become, the he had slipped out of her more than a few times. He usually thrust back within her before she could even notice. This time he pulled out deliberately.

In her sexual ecstasy, it was several seconds before Danni realized that John was no longer within her. A look of lust and need filled her face as she began to turn her head and look over her shoulder to see what had happened. She was so close to what she knew would be a truly awesome climax - he couldn't stop now. To her relief, John was already guiding his wonderful cock back to her womanhood.

No sooner had she turned her head forward again, Danni felt the sudden pressure against her vulva as Pat pulled her face back to her own steaming snatch. Danni moaned her appreciation as John's highly lubricated cock filled her again, while Pat matched her as Danni's tongue flicked against her clit. Pat reached down to play with Danni's hanging breasts as Danni slipped further and further towards a maelstrom of pleasure.

John only lasted a few strokes more before he felt a white-hot orgasm erupt from his toes through his thighs and out through his cock into Danni. The splash of hot cum on her cervix, coupled with Pat's ministrations of her body, pushed Danni over the edge. Her body quaked and bucked like a boat in a storm. She couldn't manage words; a few animalistic grunts were all that flowed from her. Even in the movies, neither John nor Pat had ever seen a woman climax like that. Pat was immediately swept up in the waves of pleasure and came again herself, matching Danni's quaking, quivering body.

Finally, Danni dropped to the floor, her energy spent. Feeling a little weak himself, John dropped down and lay next to her. Pat cuddled up against John's free side.

It was ten minutes before any one spoke. Danni finally opened her eyes and looked at John. "Thank you," she said softly. "Thank you both."

"I believe that the expression is, entirely my pleasure, miss, happy to serve," teased John.

"Yea, this is going to be fun," said Pat.

"Pat, you were right," sighed Danni.

"Right about what?" asked Pat.

"The benefits of the benefits far outweigh the pains of the transformation," concluded Danni. "Who would have believed that being a woman was this much pleasure?"

### 03 - A Mermaid's "Tale"

Danni had been the first to discover that she was actually using her gills. A few weeks after her transformation from a guy, who had been left for dead by drug thugs, into a beautiful blonde woman living in paradise, she too had developed the same red patches of skin on her back as those on Pat and John. Now, several months later, Danni was floating in the lagoon after a long lesson in tropical flora and fauna from Pat. Pat, who was formerly a male bio-chemical scientist but now was a beautiful woman as well, had grilled her endlessly on edible fish, shellfish, and plants.

"It's for your survival," pleaded Pat as she warned Danni about poisonous sea creatures. "The reef protects us, and most of these fish, from the larger predators, but there is still plenty of danger here without sharks. John will never forgive me if something happened to you."

"Yes, Mom," teased Danni as she stretched away her mid-day fatigue.

Pat gazed with open admiration at Danni's shapely torso as she arched into her stretch; Danni's full breasts with their unusually long nipples, and her sparse patch of white blonde hair atop her still new pussy set within her generously wide hips. The goop that Pat had distilled from the glands of a gender changing fish had not only changed their own gender but had also made them incredibly healthy and immune to common hurts, even sunburn. The result was that the three of them spent more time at the beach then in the forest, and they had become golden brown from head to toe.

Pat savored her own changes even as she admired Danni's. She loved the flow of the warm water over her body, around her delicate limbs, between her naked thighs; she enjoyed the occasional tug on her labia as her slowly scissoring legs that kept her afloat forced the warm water to rush between her legs. Pat compared her own full breasts as they bobbed horizontally in the water to Danni's twin peaks that were currently pointing towards the sun. Pat concentrated on the waves as they pulled and pushed against her own chest, offering her both a physical and a visual reminder of her dramatically changed status.

"You remember all the hand signals?" Pat asked, tolerating her designation of "Mom" even they were both, more or less, biologically the same age of early twenties.

"Yes, at least I remember all those, even if I can't recognize all those fish and conchs and stuff," Danni assured, ending with a little spout of water playfully directed at Pat.

"Good," Pat said with a gentle swat on Danni's arm to get her to head for the bottom.

Danni smiled at Pat and signaled the "just a minute" sign, and floated for a minute more, resting atop the warm, tropical water, feeling the small waves lap at her body like a lover. She loved the feeling her new body gave her. The water swelled in the delicate hallow of her waist, focusing attention on her dramatically smaller torso as it swept out into generous hips that supported a classic "bubble butt." She loved the feeling of displacement that her "thorax" gave her, the weight and movement of her hips and thighs. She closed her eyes, feeling the warm sun, the warm water, the cooling breeze as it stiffened her nipples atop the wobbling weight of her breasts. She loved the different stimulations of the warm water lapping at the sides of her bulging tits, the water caressing and cresting over her nipples several inches above the surface of the water. With each passing crest of water, her nipples were again subjected to the alternating stimulation of warm water and cooling breeze. The delicious tightness of her nipples almost prompted her to reach up to twist one.

Instead, she allowed her crinkling nipples to remind her of waking up that morning with both John and Pat nibbling on her long nipples, which had made her womb clench with need, aching for something to fill it up, over and over and over again. John had valiantly fulfilled that need, over and over again, until Danni had orgasmed over and over again. Then Danni and John had turned their attention to Pat, who was left gasping and helpless under their combined assault. John was already up to two orgasms himself, and they hadn't even had breakfast.

Danni gave into the warm memories of the last several months, recalling how the three of them grew closer and closer. She had never loved anyone, really, and now she loved these two with a fierceness that surprised her. She and Pat had become more than sexual partners, they had become sister-wives to the every attentive and every ready John. One surprise had been their periods. The first one had been three days of hell, and for some reason the girls were perfectly synchronized. They were better prepared for the second, which occurred about a month later, but both women had been surprised by the rich bond they had formed through this penultimate female experience. Even John had noticed the difference.

Shellfish. Right. Damn it.

Danni took a deep breath ignoring the continual horniness her body gave her and turned in the water, pulling herself toward the bottom, about twenty meters down, with languid but strong strokes of her arms and legs. The warm water was crystal clear and teeming with life. Her own now longer hair floated behind her, caressing her shoulders and back in a golden silkiness as she lazily stroked towards the bottom. A glance behind her saw the beautiful outline of Pat treading water above, her shapely legs scissoring slowly, her slender waist turning and twisting as her generous hips anchored the eggbeater kicks that kept her afloat. Pat's own rich auburn hair was even thicker and longer than Danni's, and floated along the surface of the water like lace. Danni paused on her way down to admire the flashing tuft of hair in Pat's crotch as she kept herself afloat. With an internal sigh, Danni turned again towards the bottom, trying to find the conch that Pat had assured her would be safe to eat. She was at the bottom now, floating easily, her breath comfortably held.

She wasn't recognizing anything. Danni searched and searched, not paying attention to the time. She didn't know anything was unusual until she felt a frantic pulling on her shoulder. She turned and saw a very upset Pat, trying to get her attention. Pat gestured towards her arm, as though she was pointing at a wristwatch that neither woman now possessed. Danni grinned and nodded her head, giving Pat a thumbs up: she was doing fine.

Pat gaped. Well, she gaped as much as she could while still trying to hold her breath. They had all been improving at holding their breaths for longer and longer periods, but this was astounding. By Pat's rough estimate, Danni had been down for over ten minutes and was showing no signs of discomfort. Pat flashed her the sign for ten minutes.

Danni gaped. Well, she gaped as much as she could while exhaling nearly half her breath. Ten minutes! No way, there was no possible way! She felt like she just got started, a minute or two at most! She took stock of her self, her chest, and her alertness. She felt great, and even felt fine with half her air gone. She signaled that Pat should wait, and held out her hand.

Pat looked carefully at Danni, noting that she was alert, her eyes were bright and active, and that there was no sluggishness in her limbs. She carefully took Danni's hand, and together they began to count.

1, 2, 3, ... 18, 19, 20 ... 155, 156, 157 ... at the second ten minute mark, Danni was still smiling, relaxed, and easily holding her breath. Pat too was feeling fine, and she gently turned Danni around as they continued to hold hands, floating effortlessly twenty meters below the surface. As Danni's back came into view, Pat could see that the red areas of skin that had previously looked like a rash were now raised slightly, sticking into the water like Velcro, and obviously were now working gills of some sort. She pulled Danni back to facing her, and indicated she should look at her back.

As Pat slowly turned in the water, Danni suspected what she would find, the red patches of skin on each of their backs had previously been merely a strange roughness, like a rash. Now, hundreds of tiny little fronds were raised into the water, exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide, and allowing them to "breathe" under water.

Pat slowly turned back around, and they both looked at each other with surprise and awe as what they were doing slowly sank into their consciousness. They had lost count of the time, but it didn't matter. They weren't going to surface until they had to. By mutual agreement, they both settled in to see how long they could hold out.

Four hours later, John was frantically calling out for Pat and Danni. He knew that they had gone to the lagoon to collect food, but he thought they would have been back within the hour. He was pretty sure they hadn't gone deeper into the jungle, and he knew they hadn't gone up to the hot tub that was slightly higher up the mountainside than their second camp, the original beach camp having been restored to use after being damaged in a tsunami. He had waited for nearly two hours, and then set out in search of them. Although the island was remote and small, he worried that something may have happened. After all, several months ago Daniel, now Danni, had shown up unexpectedly. Someone may have arrived on the island and the girls could be in danger.

John's fish-goop altered physique easily withstood the grueling punishment he inflicted upon himself for nearly two hours, running the length of all their known trails into the jungle, and then circumnavigating their small island entirely. His fervor surprised him. He knew that they three of them had formed a very close bond, but the ache in his chest was something new. He HAD to find his girls. He was now looking out over their small lagoon, which was nevertheless several hundred square kilometers of water, reef, and sand. He plunged into the water and started swimming.

After the first hour or so, the girls realized that simply floating ten meters down wasn't very much effort, and that they could probably keep that up indefinitely. Pat signaled that they should swim around, giving the "O.K." sign every so often, and that they should stay close to one another.

After nearly three hours of exploring the lagoon, they were still submerged, still "holding" their original breath. The afternoon sun dappled the coral and fish all around them, playing across their skin and hair. As Pat signaled that they should rest for a bit in a natural sand bowl among the many outcroppings of coral, Danni could not help but notice how beautiful Pat was as she gracefully sank towards to the bottom.

Danni drank in Pat's beauty as she twirled gently the last few meters down to the sand. Pat's auburn hair glistened and sparkled in the water and sun, floating like a halo around her head. Her large breasts, normally high and firm on Pat's rib cage, were now floating, up thrust, in the water, each tipped by thumb sized nipples thrusting upward from the middle of generous, dome shaped areolas. Her waist sloped dramatically from her slim shoulders, making her seem as though she might break in half. From her slender waist the gentle slope of her tummy smoothed out towards her wide hips, and her heart shaped ass was firm and taut in the water, and the two dimples above each ass cheek still turned Danni on in ways she couldn't understand. Finally, Danni drank in Pat's long legs that were gracefully extended like a ballerina's as Pat twirled slowly to rest her tiptoes on the sandy bottom.

Danni looked down at her own breasts, also floating up thrust in the dappled light of nearly twenty meters of salt water as she floated down towards Pat. Her own nipples weren't as thick as Pat's, but they were nearly half again as long, almost an inch. She pushed gently against the water with her hands, moving her body so that she settled next to Pat only a few inches apart. Pat's eyes were shining with mutual lust and love as Danni inched forward her.

Pat reached for her, but Danni shook her head and signaled that Pat should wait. She followed Danni's eyes to her own breasts, where Danni was slowly, ever so gently pushing their two bodies towards one another. Pat realized that their breasts would touch while their flat stomachs, shapely hips, and that the rest of their bodies were still a foot apart. The two "new" women both loved their breasts, and this sort of play was one of their favorite activities. Normally, one of them would hold herself above the other, usually while John was either licking or fucking one of them, dragging her breasts across the other's. This was different, in that they were both floating and waiting for that delicious first touch, both equally free and swaying in the water.

Pat realized that her nipples were as hard with anticipation as they had ever been, and she could see that Danni's long nipples were equally hard with excitement. The tension in her breasts caused pleasant tremors to ripple through her body, redoubled as she felt the first, whisper touch of their nipples as they glided across one another's breasts.

Pat felt herself experience a sharp intake of breath. How could that be, she barely asked herself, here under the water, as she felt Danni's torso twist slightly so that their nipples dragged across one another's in the other direction. She exhaled into the sea, moaning with pleasure, but felt no emptiness in her lungs.

Danni exhaled at the same time, her body convulsing with the sexual tension they had created. She too felt no emptiness, and felt air slowly, but steadily re-filling her lungs. Within seconds, she felt a full breath within her chest, which had expanded back out, pushing their breasts together again. Danni tried an experiment.

"Good," she gurgled into the sea, smiling at her lover, as she ground her breasts against Pat's.

"Yes," Pat replied, surprised at their experiment.

As the bubbles rose, they watched one another to see if they needed to surface. Both signaled that they were fine, and then they reached for one another and crushed their bodies together in a kiss that entwined all their limbs, tongues, and even their hair. They continued to frantically kiss and nip at each other's lips, noses, ears, and necks as their limbs stayed entwined in a fierce embrace unencumbered by gravity or position. Their moans were now nearly constant.

"I love you," Pat whispered into Danni's ear in between kisses and moans.

"I love you too," Danni joyfully replied as the bubbles rose around them and their hips found a steady rhythm as they pressed their vulvas into each other's thighs and hipbones.

"Oh, my ... I really love this," groaned Danni as Pat grabbed her ass and applied even more force to their under water humping. Danni concentrated on the rhythmic pressures that Pat's beautiful body created in her own. The heat of their vaginas pressed against one another's thighs, their breasts, full and soft, squeezing past, through, and on each other's. The press of their fingers on flesh, thigh, and hip, as they each urged the other towards climaxes.

"Yes, yes, yes," moaned Pat, discovering that her lungs filled with air as fast as she needed them to. Her back was tingling with pleasure, as she felt blood and energy being diverted to her new breathing apparatus. Her whole body felt alive, but her back felt like thousands of feathers were brushing against her, caressing her. It was making her even more excited. They were each pressing hard into each other, getting closer and closer to their orgasms. If only John were here to push them over the edge, Pat thought, as her own hair tickled against her gills, which brought even more tension to her pleasantly aching crotch. Acting on instinct, she lifted her other hand to Danni's back and gently brushed her gills.

"OH GOD," Danni exploded in a spasm of pleasure, as her sensitive gills reacting to the gentle caress, intensifying her quivering clit trapped between their mashing hips.

"OH MY GOD," Pat joined her as Danni's hand also rose to tickle her gills along her back.

They both arched into their orgasms, their hips joined in ecstasy, their legs entwined together, and their faces and their breasts arched towards the surface some twelve meters above them. They stayed like that for nearly a minute, quivering, convulsing, and coming as they floated in the dappled sunlight and warm ocean water.

This is how John found them.

As soon as John entered the water, he found that he could almost sense where they were, and without thinking, he started swimming in strong strokes, underwater, towards where he thought the girls were at the bottom of the lagoon. He sensed that they were several hundred meters out, but he didn't even think about swimming on the surface as he normally did. He was in full "rescue mode" and made a beeline for their distant outlines.

About two minutes later and nearly half the distance towards the girls, John noticed that he was swimming strong and comfortably, with no tightness in his chest. Further, that he could hear them groaning and moaning. He could see them, barely, as they were entwined together on the ocean floor, their hair swirling around as they seemed to grapple with each other in a wrestling match. As he sped up, ignoring for the moment his wonder at his own sustained physical effort under the water without any breathing, he discovered that could make out what they were saying, and realized that they weren't fighting at all.

Quite the opposite, in fact!

His urgency faded and was replaced by wonder and lust, not necessarily in that order. He was now within a few meters of the girls, and watched with appreciation as they held each other in their mutual orgasms. His own mast had now stiffened, which might also explain why he wasn't swimming with the same speed as he had just a moment ago. He marveled at his own effortless breathing, and as he watched the last of the bubbles rise to the surface from their mutual expletives of pleasure, he experimentally released about half of his air into the water. He felt the slow filling of his lungs as his gills absorbed oxygen from the sea and metabolized it into air and refilled his lungs comfortably. He waited until the ladies had stopped quivering, and then he approached.

"Any left for me?" he asked.

Locked in their embrace, neither lady broke their pose, but both smiled towards the sunlight.

"There might be," Pat teased, as she gently ran her fingers across Danni's gills again.

"Ahhhhhhhh," Danni screamed as she went into a second round of convulsions.

"It's amazing how easy it is to talk," John offered.

"It's amazing how easy it is to cum," Pat observed as she held the still shaking Danni in her arms, enjoying the pressure of their hips as they still ground against one another.

"Why don't you find out by putting that mast to good use," Pat asked, unhooking one leg from Danni to offer John access to her vagina.

John swore he could almost see cum leaking from the two of them, a gentle cloud of color in the clear water. He clapped his hands above his head, sliding underneath the two floating ladies, and grabbed Pat's hips to anchor himself. Danni adjusted her legs so that she now clutched one of Pat's and one of John's in her velvety thighs. That gave everyone leverage to line up all the important parts, and John aimed his pleasantly aching penis at Pat's now gaping hole.

"Ahhhhh," cried both Pat and John as the incredible sensation of a cool penis sliding into a hot cunt as a series of incredible sensations exploded through each of them. Danni also cried out, as she climaxed a third time as Pat moved her hips and her hands across the two most sensitive areas on Danni's body. No one moved for a moment, the three of them locked in a passionate embrace, each of their lungs slowly filling with air after that shared outburst.

Then John began to pump, slowly pushing his nine-inch cock in and out of Pat's tight vagina. Danni could feel John's cock as it slid past their connected crotches, into Pat's tunnel. Pat luxuriated in the feeling of John's thick cock as it slid icy cool, then steaming hot, in and out of her quivering hole. She could feel Danni's excitement as their hips still ground against one another's, John's strong thighs entwined with their own; their breasts still mashed to one another's. They continued lazily for a moment or so.

Then Danni brought her hand up to Pat's gills, and give her a light brush.

"AAAAAAAHHHHHH," screamed Pat as the most intense orgasm she had yet felt ripped through her body, her entire torso clenched in spasms of pleasure. She resumed her original pose, now even more intensely as her body visibly shook with pleasure, her thick nipples pointing to the sky.

"AAAAAHHHHH," screamed John, as his cock was compressed by the surge of Pat's orgasm, ripping one of his own from his surprised body-suddenly feeling several strong, pulsing shots of cum shooting into her. His own body arched too, with his face contorted in pleasure, facing the bottom of the sea, as he held on to Pat's hip's with his hands, and Danni's legs with his thighs, as his crotch pulsed again and again, filling Pat with his boiling cum.

"Ah," signed Danni as she watched her lovers catch up to the over powering orgasms she had already enjoyed, shaking in a nevertheless satisfyingly smaller orgasm.

An hour later, everyone was sated.

They had tried multiple positions, sometimes with just two, but most often all three of them entwined in nearly endless variations.

They now sat or floated with their legs interlocked, more or less, in the soft sand in the small bowl in which John had discovered the girls locked in their original embrace. They all found it odd, and at the same time completely natural, that they were sitting and chatting under water. There was an odd distortion to their diction, but after a moment or two, they found that they didn't notice it very much. The biggest difference was that brief moment or two, a few seconds, really, that was required to re-fill their lungs with air. But after a while, even that pause seemed natural.

"We don't have to leave the water, ever," mused Pat.

"But we probably should," worried John.

"Why?" asked Danni.

"I think that our changes are being accelerated by our behaviors, and who knows what or how we might continue to change" (a pause) "into if we stayed in the water indefinitely," explained John.

"John's right," agreed Pat. "We need to be careful, though I'm not afraid of further changes," (a pause) "since the ones we have undergone have been beneficial."

"How so?" asked Danni?

"Well, there's this," Pat explained as she ran her fingers along both John's and Danni's gills. They both shivered with pleasure.

"Stop that, or we'll never leave the water," complained Danni.

"This is also a great way to avoid unwanted visitors, strong storms, and various other disasters," continued Pat.

"Well, even so, I think we should spend the night up on land, and" (a pause) "I'm getting hungry," warned John.

"We can eat here, if we do sushi," mused Pat.

"I was getting fond of roasted fish," pouted Danni. "And I like the smell of cooking. We can't do that down here."

"Oh, alright back to shore we go," Pat agreed, and turned to swim towards shore. Without even thinking, all three of them started swimming, frog style, towards the shore.

"I guess we won't ever have to swim along the surface, huh?" mused John as he pulled along side of Pat's undulating body, enjoying the flex of her hips and legs as she kicked another scissors kick, propelling her forward.

"Not unless we want to go fast," rejoined Pat.

"How about like this," asked Danni as she switched her stoke from a frog to a dolphin kick, and stretched out her arms in front of her like Superwoman.

Pat and John watched in both wonder and lust, not necessarily in that order, as Danni's shapely body undulated in the classic motions of a mermaid's swim, except that not only was Danni much prettier than any movie version of a mermaid (and naked), but also her entire body seemed much more coordinated, or "in tune," with her strokes, which shot her body forward with surprising speed. They both shrugged at each other and switched to dolphin kicks.

It took only a few tries, but both John and Pat realized that their bodies seemed particularly apt to this stroke. They both moved through the water with surprising speed and ease. Pat thrilled to the new rhythms she discovered in her body, the way her entire body sensuously, yet strongly, undulated through the water. It was as if she was swimming with her entire torso, rather than primarily with her limbs alone. It was intoxicating. The water rushed through her hair, caressed her breasts, and flicked off her toes as they beat the water up and down.

Despite their best efforts, they didn't catch Danni; though John nearly did.

"Are we still human?" asked Danni.

Pat and John briefly shared a glance, as they each sipped some "punch" as they lounged in the hot tub. They had stayed away from the lagoon for several days, each thrilled yet spooked by the siren call the water had exerted upon their hearts, minds, and bodies. No one really wanted to talk about it, but each had both savored his or her time on land and feared the siren call of the sea.

Pat had spent time constructing a safe of sorts, carved from rocks embedded in the mountain itself, to store all her (some were "his," she noted with irony) notes and formulas gathered over the past year or so. As she did so, she was consciously aware that one reason she felt compelled to do this task was that she felt as though she'd be spending more and more time in the water, and less and less time in the lab.

John also had gathered equipment and supplies from the upper camps and distributed them to various locations around the island, mostly centered in the numerous caves and inlets that doted the ragged shore of the small island. He too had consciously felt the pull of the water.

Danni, not having spent so much time on the island as Pat and John had simply taken to watching the sea from the high perch of the rocky outcropping upon which John and Pat had engineered their hot tub. She watched with both hope and fear as the other two had slowly but inexorably changed their focus from the mountainside to the ocean side. She wondered how long the pull of gravity on her breasts would remind her of her new sex, rather than the gentle caress of the water as it lifted and supported her swaying breasts. Both sensations felt powerful and wonderful, and she couldn't decide which seemed to call to her more.

"We will always be human, more or less," Pat argued. "I know we are all feeling things, powerful feelings, but we are not losing any sort of human feelings towards one another."

"You're right. I'm feeling more alive and in love than I have ever felt before," Danni said unselfconsciously. "I'm not afraid ... as long as I have you two," Danni concluded as she slid across the tub to position herself in between her two lovers. "I never thought I could feel this way about anyone, but I'd do anything for you two." Danni leaned into Pat and gave her a toe curling kiss, while John stroked the small of her back, admiring the dimples above her ass cheeks.

"We've only made love twice today ... we're short of the required minimum," Danni said coyly. "Who's up for some loving?"

John twisted his hips in reply, moving his already stiff member into the crack of her ass, causing Danni to hunch her hips back towards him. She turned more fully into Pat's kisses, and let her breasts settle onto Pat's. John guided her pussy over his rampant cock, and eased her down into his lap.

"Oh, god ... that feels so good," breathed Danni as she found Pat's equally wet and warm slit with her fingers and eased two into the breach, her thumb pressed lightly into Pat's clit.

"Yes," breathed Pat, "it does ... sooooo good. Kiss me."

John began to stroke slowly in Danni's hot pussy while Danni's mouth and fingers worked magic on Pat's eager body below her. Their legs again found themselves entwined, this time in the warmth of the hot tub. Danni was half floating in the water, half resting on Pat, which allowed John to admire the gentle quiver that ran up her ass and hips into the small of her back as he bottomed out on each stroke. Pat held Danni's face in her hands, lavishing her with kisses and licks as John's insistent strokes forced their breasts to slide past, around, and through one another's in a symphony of sensation.

"Oh, god ... oh, god ... uh, uh, uh," moaned Danni into Pat's mouth, their full lips cushioning their kisses as John kept up a steady rhythm. She loved the intense fullness of John's cock, the way her entire body was forced to respond to this powerful, yet gentle, invasion. She moaned anew as she felt John twist into a standing position behind her in the tub, never letting his rhythm falter, and felt his strong hands firmly grasp her waist just above her jutting hip bones. She felt her approaching orgasm building deliciously in her womb, sending out tendrils of electricity throughout her body.

John slowly sped up his rhythm, keeping Danni's beautiful ass just at the surface of the water so that the warm water of the hot tub reinforced the slapping of their bodies. Pat scooted up a bit, bringing her own generous breasts into the night air, and guided Danni's lips to her nipples. Danni relaxed into the pillow of Pat's breasts while John's intensity slowly built.

"Oh, oh ... that's it, right ... there," Danni moaned as John's hands gently tilted her hips out of the water while he rose slightly on his toes, so that his thick cock sawed firmly back and forth against her Gspot. Her narrow torso now began to twitch and quiver as her orgasm hurtled towards its climax. Her body was alight with an internal fire, every nerve ending seemed to be sending glorious signals to the center of her being, and she knew she was losing control of her body to the increasingly violent twitches and shakes of her impending orgasm.

"That's it baby," cooed Pat in to Danni's ear as she caressed and held the beautiful blonde's face to her breast. "Cum for us." With that, Pat ran a finger along Danni's spine, not touching her gills, but her feather light touch nevertheless caused Danni to go over the edge. John held on for dear life as Danni thrashed out her passion in the hot tub, water and cum spraying everywhere.

Danni rode out the orgasm, feeling her body clench and unclench with blinding speed, shaking her to her core. She was dimly aware of John's own orgasm as she felt her internal muscles clamp down on his thick, hot cock, while he violently deposited his seed into her womb. So too with Pat's nipple that she had bit down upon, which was now oozing a whitish substance into her nearly unconscious mouth.

All she knew was bliss.

Two days later, they found a boat on the other side of the island.

Pat had gone off on what she thought might be a final survey of the island, feeling the increasing tug of the water on her heart. She wanted to catalogue everything one more time. She also wanted to spend some time alone, away from the stimulation and affection of John and Danni. Oh, she enjoyed her time with them, but both she and Danni had been oozing a milk-like substance from their otherwise unaffected breasts for the past two days. After Danni had resumed conscious control of her body, she kissed Pat and shared the sweet warmth that had oozed from her own nipples. Later that same night when they returned to their mountainside hut, John was reprising the position with Pat on all fours, suspended above Danni, as Pat suckled Danni's long nipples while John's thick and tireless cock brought Pat to a shattering orgasm.

Danni had also produced the same milky substance as had Pat. They had discovered that any suckling quickly produced milk from either girl, and that nearly any sexual activity produced leakage >from their breasts. And on the second evening, they discovered that repeated orgasms reached while they sucked on one another's breasts would cause their breasts to swell until milk would literally shoot from their nipples as the girls shook with titanic orgasms.

John thought it was the coolest thing ever, and Danni had reveled in this newfound facet of her still new femininity. Pat had enjoyed the feelings of "cuming" from both her crotch and her chest, but suspected that it signaled even more changes that were sweeping through their bodies. Her suspicions were confirmed when John discovered that a cut he barely noticed while gathering morning firewood was healed as he suckled Pat awake that morning. They were producing "goop," more or less, from their breasts.

The long walk around the island in the early morning had produced the desired result in Pat. She was clear headed and calm, until she spotted the boat. It was a luxury pleasure fishing craft, new, and apparently undamaged, other than being stuck in the rocks a few meters off shore, tilting at a slight angle away from the surf. She couldn't see any people, but she knew better than to explore alone. She hurried back to her side of the island.

John and Danni were re-arranging supplies and food in the beach hut when Pat returned, flushed but not over exerted despite having run nearly two miles through the jungle.

"We have visitors," Pat announced.

"Where?" John asked, putting down the fish he was cleaning.

"Rocky Cove, due north," she answered using the names they had given to the various parts of the island.

"How many?" Danni asked, brushing sand from her hands and knees as she rose from the stack of palm fronds they had been drying for thatch.

"I don't know," Pat answered. "I didn't see any people, but the boat look undamaged, other than being wedged in some rocks. But I didn't get very close."

"That's a good thing. How far out is the boat?" asked John.

"It is about ten meters from the shore in about five meters of water," she said.

"The drop-off is fairly close to shore on the north side of the island, so we could swim around the island and get right up to the boat without being seen," John offered.

"We?" asked Danni.

"Yes, we," answered Pat with a smile. "We shouldn't separate ourselves, and we can warn each other if we see any sign of guns or ocean predators."

"You mean, like sharks?" worried Danni.

"Well, we've got to see how we do out in the open sea sooner or later," Pat said.

"We can take some knives," offered John as he strode to the hut and unearthed one of their hidden store boxes. He returned with two small knives and one large one that he strapped to his leg. The girls each strapped a smaller one to their shapely legs, and they all surveyed the beach and lagoon one more time.

Their quick scan of the camp showed that they had hidden or stowed most of their most valuable equipment, and that they could easily access various depots around their lagoon.

"Well, then ... let's do it," Danni agreed.

And the three of them plunged into the warm water of "their" lagoon.

They each immediately resumed the dolphin strokes that had propelled them so efficiently when they were last in the water. John had to slow down as his body was stronger and had less hair, though his was getting long, and fewer protrusions, like breasts, that caused drag. Nevertheless, they all made good progress, improving their strokes as they went, so that by the time they reached the open water, their knees hardly bent at all, but rather their entire bodies were undulating through the water. They could easily talk, but they saved their energy for swimming at top speed. They were snaking through the water with an ease and grace that surprised each of them, and when they reached Rocky Cove about twenty minutes later, they knew that they were each swimming as fast as any Olympic swimmer, and entirely underwater. More surprisingly, they were apparently unaffected by this extraordinary effort.

It was about noon when they spotted the stern of the boat, with its large propellers visible in the surf as they hovered about five meters below the surface of the water. "The Argo: Byron Bay, Australia," Pat made out through the rough surf above. The hull looked intact, though a good storm would pound the boat through the rocks and shatter it. John took the lead, and swam up to the ladder and then slowly and silently climbed up into the air.

He was unprepared for what he saw.

There was blood on the deck-a lot of blood on the deck.

"Stay down there for a moment, but keep scanning the shore and sea," he told the girls. Then he clambered over the bulkhead and onto the deck. The main cabin door was closed, but there was a bloody handprint on the door. He picked his way across the deck and towards the cabin. He peered in through the captain's window, and could see several shapes slumped over the table, floor, and the lounge to the fore. This had been a luxury-fishing vessel. He saw no sign of weapons, and so he gently eased open the door.

It stopped against something heavy after only a few inches. He looked through the crack and saw an arm, a male arm, covered in blood. He pushed harder, and the arm moved. John pushed again, and the arm moved some more, but the inert man was very large. He glanced inside the cabin again, and saw that no one had moved. He wasn't sure any of them were still alive, as there was a sickly smell coming from the now open cabin door.

"Girls," he called out. "Come on up and give me a hand."

The three islanders stood unselfconsciously naked on the deck of the fishing boat, their long hair sluicing water down their backs, their bronze skin shining in the sunlight, their nearly perfect bodies moving with grace and power. Together, the three of them pushed the door open, and entered the cabin.

The stench was nearly overwhelming.

The large man was dead, but he was holding a gun. His face was bloated with dehydration. There was another man, much smaller than the large man at the door, who was tied to the table. He appeared to have been beaten, but it looked as though he was still breathing, if barely. Three other women were tied or handcuffed to chairs or the wall around the cabin. Two women looked to be in their mid-fifties, while the third looked to be a teenager who might have been attractive if she hadn't also been beaten, and who knew what else. The all looked like they were still breathing.

The girls quickly set to work at freeing the captives with their knives while John stowed the gun behind a cushion and hauled the dead man out onto the deck and heaved his body into the surf off the stern. When he returned he found that the girls had been successful in their tasks.

"They are all still alive, but just barely," observed Pat as she cradled the teen's head against her bosom.

"We need to get them off this boat and back to the cove," Danni said as she eased the man's head to the floor, now that the ropes no longer bound him upright against the leg of the table. None of the captives seemed able to stir. "There doesn't seem to be any food or water in this cabin."

"There is an inflatable dinghy on the bow of the boat," John observed. "It looks sound, and we can haul them back in that."

While John freed the boat, Pat gave a quick search confirmed that there was no water, no food, and no gas on the boat.

"It looks as though they had a Mexican Standoff and drifted into our island," Pat concluded. "We can find out more if they ever regain consciousness."

John tossed the dinghy over the stern and secured it to the bulkhead while the girls lifted each of the unconscious humans out onto the deck. One of the older ladies moaned briefly, but she didn't regain consciousness. Pat went down to the boat as Danni and John lowered each person down to her. She arranged first the two women, who were the largest, on the bow and stern of the small craft, and then the badly beaten man and the teenager in the middle.

Danni and John arched off the starboard side, gracefully slicing into the water and popped up beside the dinghy. Pat slid off the dinghy and joined them in the water. John took the bowline while each of the girls rested their hands on the stern. They all put their heads down into the water and started swimming.

It took them nearly an hour to get the boat back to the cove, and it was good timing. Clouds were beginning to appear on the eastern horizon, and Pat estimated that a storm of some size was heading their way. It would probably reach them by evening.

They simply dragged the inflatable up to the hut, which was only about thirty meters from the beach. Once there, they eased each of their patients into the hut and put a wet rag against each of their lips. After about an hour of slowly soaking their lips in water, the first of them stirred. It was the teenager.

The girl was a slightly built, blonde, with delicate elfin features that were swollen by dehydration and starvation. She was only about 5' 2'', and slender. She looked like she could be a relative of the middle-aged man, perhaps a daughter. He, on the other hand, was average height and weight, just shy of six feet tall, but he shared the same fine features around his eyes and nose. His hair was a light brown, rather than the teen's blonde. The two older women were attractive, in good shape, but thin and gaunt. They looked like they had been starved for much longer than the girl or the man. They were each about five foot 10 or 11 inches tall, and they had matching haircuts-a pageboy that looked completely out of place in the tropics.

The teenager shifted again in her sleep, struggling towards consciousness.

"Whuuu .... Whuuuu," she moaned.

"Water, dear?" Danni asked.

"Whuuree ummm eee," she croaked.

"You're safe," Danni reassured her, even as she raised a cup of water to the girl's cracked lips. "No too much, just a little to get started," she chided as the young girl hungrily reached for cup.

After about ten minutes, her eyes finally cracked open in the afternoon shade of the hut. "Where am I?" she asked more clearly, in an Australian accent.

"You're on an island in the South Pacific, one that had been used for nuclear testing about fifty years ago," Pat answered gently stroking her hair out of the girl's face. "We have been living here for a little less than a year, I guess."

"Who?" the young girl asked, as she slurped another drink of water.

"I'm Pat," she said, "and this is Danni," indicating the woman who was cradling her head.

"You're pretty," she whispered.

"Thank you, my dear," Danni smiled back at her. "So are you."

"No, I'm not," she whimpered as she screwed her eyes shut and buried her head in Danni's lap. After a moment, she turned her head slightly, and lifted her eyes to Danni's face, taking in the large protrusions that partially blocked her view. She turned back to Pat and took in, through her bleary eyes, Pat's beautiful form.

"You're naked," she whispered, surprised but not scandalized.

"Yes, we've found it easier that way," admitted Pat. "What's your name, dear?"

"Phoebe," she said.

"Well, Phoebe. I suspect that you've had a very tough time recently, and you'll need to sort some things out," Pat said.

"What about Uncle Pete," she asked.

"Uncle Pete," asked Pat as she pointed at the man who was still unconscious against the far wall of the hut.

"Oh, poor Peter," Phoebe whispered, a tear squeezing from her eye. "He tried so hard to stop them."

"Stop who?" asked Danni.

"Alberto ... " Phoebe started.

"Estanado," finished Danni to Pat's arched eyebrow.

"You know him," asked Phoebe, surprised.

"I had a run in with him myself," Danni admitted. "Were you guys ... um ... doing anything ... illegal?

"No," Phoebe protested, coughing against her still dry throat. "Uncle Peter would never do any such thing."

"The other two women?" Danni asked indicating the still unconscious older women.

"I don't know," Phoebe reported. "They were on another boat when Alberto pirated ours."

"The Argo?" asked Pat.

"Yes, that is my Uncle's boat," Phoebe explained. "He's a fairly rich investor, and he often invites me to spend weekends with him." She took another sip of water. "Will he be alright?"

"I hope so," Danni reassured her. "He is still breathing, but he's taken a beating. We will have to be patient."

"Isn't there anything you can do for him?" Phoebe pleaded.

"We don't know," Pat said with a calculated eye towards Danni.

"How's it going in there?" asked John from outside the hut.

"We've got one awake, and three still recovering," answered Pat. "Why don't you introduce yourself?"

John poked his head around the doorway and looked inside the slightly crowded hut. "Hi, I'm John."

"Are you naked too?" asked Phoebe.

"Yea, sorry about that," John said sheepishly.

"No worries," Phoebe said lightly. "I often go to the nude beach at home."

"You?" asked Danni.

"Yea, I'm nearly eighteen, and my parents don't mind," Phoebe reported.

"Well, then," said John stepping into the room, "I'm pleased to meet you."

Phoebe drew a sharp intake of breath. Never before had she seen such a magnificent work of manhood. John's tall and lean, cut form took her breath away, and the six inches of relaxed man meat that swayed between his legs was equally engaging. Pat and Danni shared a knowing smile as they watched the young but injured girl attempt to sit up and straighten her blouse. John reached down and shook her hand and as she gave him a shy smile.

All this additional stimulation caused one of the women Pat had been tending to moan softly into her wet cloth. Pat hurried over and squeezed a few drops more into her mouth. The woman coughed softly, and wheezed.

"Schtoop ieeet," she moaned. "Doonnnn oooch meeee."

"Hush, hush," Pat reassured her. "Alberto's gone and you're safe here."

At the sound of the name that had tormented her for the past few months, Gail's eyes shot open. She struggled to raise her head, but could only lift it an inch or so up, before her weakened condition forced her to give up.

"Whhhhheeeeeeerrrrrreeee mmmm eeeeee?" she asked.

"You're on an island, and you're safe," Pat stroked her hair away from her face.

Over the next half hour, as the two women gained strength, the story slowly emerged from Phoebe and Gail. Gail and her sister, Michelle, had been missionaries in the Philippines when Alberto's men had kidnapped them a few months ago. Michelle had fought against their captors at every opportunity, with the result that most of the abuse had been targeted on her, rather than Gail. Both women, however, had been raped and used by countless men for several weeks, when they were mysteriously transferred to The Argo about two weeks ago.

Alberto's men had pirated the ship that morning, and by noon two of Alberto's henchmen had been assigned to take the boat and its three female passengers to Thailand where the women would be sold into prostitution, Peter was to have been killed at sea. However, the two men fought over who should "deflower" the young Phoebe. Peter, who spoke Spanish, had managed to sew distrust among them, keeping the two men in a state of agitation, so that neither trusted the other enough to spend time with Phoebe alone while the other one was to kill and dispose of Peter. Gail and Michelle had been locked in a smaller cabin.

Finally, the henchmen had traded gunshots, and the larger man survived his wound. He had forced Peter and Michelle to cut up the body and dump it over board, by holding Phoebe and Gail at gunpoint, and then forced Michelle to tie up the others by threatening to shoot Phoebe, and then he handcuffed Michelle as well. Then the large man had repeatedly raped and beat Michelle in front of the others because she had refused to obey him. When Peter protested, he beat him as well.

Two days later, the henchmen, whose name they never learned, only that he was called Blade, began to act erratically, probably due to some infections from his wound. By that evening, Blade was delirious on the floor of the cabin, threatening to kill them all. Only Phoebe's gentle promise of her virginity kept him from shooting everyone. Throughout the night, the helm was unmanned, and the boat wandering aimlessly at half throttle, with all the passengers trapped in the cabin.

Thankfully, Phoebe never had to make good on her promise, as the next morning Blade was dead, but the boat was still running, and no one could escape their bonds. Michelle had lost consciousness, and Peter joined her that evening. Gail and Phoebe tried to keep each other awake, and they made it through the second night. The next day, the engine finally ran out of gas, and after three more days of drifting, they had lost consciousness. They didn't know how long it had been when John and the girls rescued them.

Pat concluded >from the story that Peter and Michelle were probably in serious trouble and might not regain consciousness.

The storm arrived as predicted, and the seven of them huddled safely in the hut through the night. The next morning, after checking on their patients, John jogged across the island to see if the boat had survived the storm while Danni and Pat prepared breakfast. When John returned, the three of them strolled down the beach, talking. The boat was gone with out a trace, both Phoebe and Gail were doing much better, but no improvement was visible in Peter or Michelle.

"I think we need to tell them about the goop," argued Danni.

"We still don't know them well enough," Pat countered.

"You didn't know me at all, and now look at us," Danni retorted.

"Danni may have a point," John offered.

"What do you mean by that?" Pat asked.

"I think there may be some bonding that goes along with the transformations that we have experienced," John explained. "When I am in the hut with Peter, I feel the twinges of that old worry, but not nearly the way I did with Daniel."

"I forbid you to ever utter that name again," Danni chided.

"Noted," mused John as he gave her a kiss that stiffened her nipples. "However, I think that like the fish, we might only need some sort of harem for multiple males to peacefully co-exist. Peter could start a new harem with Gail and Michelle, and we could adopt Pheobe."

"You're just eyeing that fresh young girl," teased Pat. "You pervert, she's still a virgin."

"And you're not?" returned John.

"No comment," Pat grumped. "Besides, separating Peter and Phoebe would be a genetic plus."

"Are we talking about babies?" asked John with a slight stutter.

"We don't have any birth control," Pat said steadily. "Both Danni and I have had periods, and we have sex multiple times a day. I'd say it was merely a matter of time."

"Oh, my god," John muttered. "I'm never having sex again."

"Don't bet on it," teased Danni as she rubbed her breast against John's elbow. "I can barely control myself for half a day."

"I think Danni's right," Pat concluded. "We have changed so much, and it seems to have Darwinian power behind it. If we don't have babies, I think we'll go mad. Besides, we no longer need to produce the goop. Danni and I are already doing it on our own, and I would bet that your sperm produces similar effects on anyone who ingests it."

"So what should we do?" ask the stunned John.

"You and I should take Phoebe and Michelle, and Danni should go with Peter and Gail," Pat said.

"Oh, I see," Danni said. "We each get an injured person, and one man whom we then can focus on to build the new family. And in a few days, when everyone is transformed, I can come back to you, and Michelle can return to Peter and Gail."

"Right," said Pat. "We will always be our own family first."

"Um, don't I get any say in this?" asked John.

"No!" the two women said in unison as they turned back towards the hut.

"Darwinian forces indeed," John muttered under his breath. "The female of the species is always the more powerful."

Both Phoebe and Gail were shaken by the news Danni and Pat had shared. But neither could ignore the steadily deteriorating conditions of both Peter and Michelle. They all sat in silence while the two women tried to absorb what their options were.

"You were both men?" asked Phoebe.

"Yes, we were," answered Pat.

"Would it work the other way?" Gail asked.

"I don't know," answered Pat. "But I should think so."

"How does it work?" asked Gail.

"I think you should explain more fully why you want to know before I could explain to you how it might work," Pat said.

"Michelle was badly raped by many men," Gail said tearfully. "And before she lost consciousness, she told me she wished she was a man."

"That's probably understandable, given what happened to her," offered Danni.

"No, it's more than that," Gail continued. "Michelle was a lesbian, um ... who really resented being in a woman's body. Being missionaries was one way of trying to avoid being a lesbian."

"And you?" asked Pat.

"I've never much thought about sex," Gail said, as though thinking about it for the first time. "I was always so wrapped up in my missionary work that I never gave it much thought. I think I'm asexual."

"None of us were overly sexually active," warned Pat. "But since our transformations, sex is a very important part of our lives."

"I thought as much," sighed Gail. "But some things are more important."

"Like what?" asked John.

"I have to save Michelle's life," Gail said with a quaver. "I also know that I can't go back to who I was. I don't believe in many of the things and ideas I once did. Given all that has happened to me, I guess I've learned that life comes at us with more surprises than expectations. Everything I thought was true has been shown unreliable; a loving god, changing sex, even breathing underwater! I am not going to tell anyone ever again that I know better about life, God, or whatever, than someone else."

"Good plan," said Pat gently. "I am not the person I once was. And Danni, you can wipe that smirk off your face. I meant it metaphysically, not just my gender."

"I knew what you meant," said Gail.

"Peter too," offered Phoebe.

"Peter too, what?" asked John.

"Peter was, or is, a cross-dresser, and I was one of the few people he trusted enough to tell," Phoebe told her stunned listeners.

"You mean we finally have some people who might actually want to change sexes, rather than accidentally?" observed Pat with some irony.

"Yes, really," Phoebe urged, her youthful eyes now shinning with hope. "Peter would think that he had died and gone to heaven. He suffered so much, not just lately, but his whole life. He's never married, but he's so sweet. Please?" Phoebe pleaded.

Everyone's eyes turned to Pat.

"Right," she said. "So, we need either myself or Danni with each group, and that means we should put Peter and Gail with me and John, and Danni should go with Michelle and Phoebe. That way Michelle will have the largest mass in the group, and Phoebe can help reinforce Danni's female status."

"I think we should feed Peter and Michelle the last of the distilled goop to speed their healing while you and Danni start Phoebe and Gail on their first feedings," John offered. "That way, Michelle can walk up to the mountainside hut, along with Danni and Phoebe, while the rest of us stay at the beach. The close confines of the hot tub should both mentally promote and physically ease Michelle's transition since she will be in close quarters with two other women."

"Phoebe and Gail, I have to get your promise on something first," Danni interjected.

They both nodded.

"When all is said and done, Michelle can be the leader of one family, but I will return to John and Pat," Danni continued solemnly. "I've come to realize that the two of them are the true love of my life."

There was an awkward silence.

"Danni, you have my promise," Gail said. "I will return to my sister, as I will be too old to worry about children."

"Oh, I wouldn't go that far," Pat mused. "All three of us got younger as we transitioned, so that now we appear to be the same age, more or less. I'm pretty sure the same will happen to you."

"Even to me?" asked Phoebe.

"I can't be sure, but I don't think you'll get younger," Pat said thoughtfully. "But you will change. We all have changed."

There was general agreement to John's plan, despite all the warnings and worries, and so he ran to the mountainside hut to gather the last of the distilled goop, while Pat took Gail into her lap and guided her lips to her breasts. Danni moved Phoebe's head back so she could reach the breasts that had dangled above her lips for most of the previous evening.

"I've never done anything like this," Gail offered hesitatingly. "I'm not sure that I can do it."

"Trust me," Pat said. "You will feel much better than you have ever felt in your life, and it will allow all of us to survive together on this island."

Phoebe, on the other hand, unhesitatingly took Danni's extended nipple into her mouth and sucked earnestly. She was quickly rewarded with a warm sweetness that seemed to seep quickly through out her entire body, easing her aches and pains, and invigorating her tired mind and muscles. Danni was overwhelmed with pleasurable feelings as she felt Phoebe tug and pull at her breast, suckling on her expanding nipple. She could feel her other breast expand in anticipation of it's use, and loved the feeling of fullness that stretched across her chest.

Pat noticed the change in Danni's posture, her slightly open mouth, the glazed look in her eyes. She reached down to her own pendulous breast and pressed lightly under the nipple with her forefingers while using her thumb to apply pressure from above, then pulling her breast outward over Gail's fearful face. After several invigorating pushes and pulls at her breast, she coaxed a few drops to appear on her large nipple. Pat noticed the changes in her own breathing, not quite sexual, but not NOT sexual either. Another sensuous tug and more drops appeared.

The frozen Gail watched in a mixture of horror and fascination as the drops gathered above her face, collecting at the bottom of the impressive bulge of Pat's breasts as white milk oozed down from her nipple, where-after several more drops had collected- a large drop of milky white substance detached and landed on Gail's parched lips.

The warmth and sweetness was a shock to her, but not nearly as shocking as the instantaneous and steady rise of her own hand reaching to pull the rest of that amazing breast to her lips. Pat saw that her first drops had had the intended effect, and lowered her swelling breast to Gail's lips. She nearly arched back in pleasure at the first powerful contact as Gail sucked several inches of her breast into her mouth. Pat held steady, quivering with pleasure but she did not pull her breast from Gail's now eager mouth as she felt the milk gush from her breast.

When John returned, Phoebe and Gail had fallen into a deep, healing sleep; both of them having drained Pat and Danni dry. The girls took the remaining canisters of the goop from John and poured a few drops into Peter's and Michelle's lips. They then dabbed as much as they dared on the visible wounds and bruises they could find on each of their bodies, removing clothing as they went. Meanwhile, John gently removed Phoebe's and Gail's clothing as they slept. Both Peter and Michelle recovered enough consciousness to drink the remaining goop, but as soon as they were alert enough to ask a question, they lapsed into the same healing sleep that had claimed Phoebe, Gail, and Daniel.

The next morning everyone was alert, awake, and naked. As Phoebe gently walked the frail Peter towards the beach, she informed him of all she knew. Gail did the same in the opposite direction for Michelle. When everyone returned for the breakfast that Danni and Pat had now prepared, most everyone's questions had been settled.

"Do you really think this will make me a man?" asked Michelle.

"Yes, we do," answered Pat. "But it may do more than that, as we are not sure that our own changes are complete yet."

"You mean the mermaid thing?" asked Peter.

"Yes, though it is highly unlikely that we would simply morph into some sort of fantasy creature as depicted in the movies," counted Pat.

"You look like fantasies to me," mused Phoebe as she admired Danni, Pat, and John.

"It won't be easy for you, Michelle," offered Pat. "You'll have to will yourself to change, I think. Yours may take longer than Peter's, and we know how long his will take."

"We shall see," Michelle offered with grim determination. "You weren't on that boat."

"Then, Michael," John said with compassion and surprised looks from all as they heard the masculine version of Michelle's name, "I'll look forward to having a teammate when trouble next arrives."

"You think they will be back?" asked Gail with fear in her voice.

"That scum has already deposited two cargos on this island in the last few months," Michelle said evenly. "We will run into Alberto and his men again. But the next time, things will be different ... really different."

And with that "Michael" collected the supplies that their group was to take up the mountain, and reached out to Danni and Phoebe. "Let's go," she said simply.

Gail started to say something, but a look from Michelle stopped her. "Goodbye, Michelle," she said tearfully.

"Goodbye Gail," she said with determination. "I'll always be your sibling. Soon, I'll be your brother." And holding the other two girl's hands, she strode confidently up the hill.

Peter was nearly as shy as Gail had been at his first "live" feeding, but Pat was not in a patient mood.

"You've spent all morning telling me how lucky I am to be a woman, and you won't take your lunch as you should," Pat demanded. "Look at Gail, she's raring to go."

Gail was indeed eager to return to Pat's breasts. Her brief feeding that morning was all that was necessary to convince her that the changes that were headed her way were good. She felt better physically and mentally than she had in years. It was as if the years were melting way. Her own hands looked more firm and less wrinkled than every before, and she could turn and swivel her hips more than she had since she was twenty. She could even touch her toes!

Peter was puzzled by his reluctance. He intellectually knew what Pat's breasts would do to him, or he at least believed what John and Pat had told him. He should be eager to embrace this opportunity.

"Peter," interrupted John. "What should your new name be?"

"My new name," asked Peter.

"Yes, you're about to be a woman ... so what should we call you?" repeated John.

Peter looked at the stunningly handsome John. All his life he hoped for some man to call him Petra, and now one was asking him.

"Petra," offered Peter timidly. "I've always wanted to be called Petra."

"After the Playboy model from the early 90s?" asked Pat. "Hey, I was a guy once," she said to John's arched eyebrow.

"No, actually, I dreamed of that name years before she arrived on the pages of Playboy, but for the last few years, I've fantasized about having her incredible body," breathed Peter in a mixture of fear and anticipation.

"Pat's is better," John said with a smile.

"Oh, I didn't mean, er," Peter stammered. "But there is a resemblance between Pat and Petra."

"She was taller, and her face was more angular," Pat mused.

"Yes, but you're still beautiful," Peter argued.

"That's not what either of us meant," John assured him. "I was just teasing. I think that Pat ought to help Gail along, while Petra focuses on what I can do for her," John concluded while stroking his cock to full attention.

"John, I think you may have something there," Pat mused as she saw the change in Peter's/Petra's face. "In fact, it would give us good data on the different effects of change agents; distilled goop versus organically produced compounds, and female fluids v. male fluids."

Gail, seeing that Pat was now free from Petra's attentions, rose from her bed to attach herself to Pat's breasts. Both women gloried in the warmth and sensuousness that their coupling created.

Peter was stunned with himself. No, Petra, yes, she/he thought to himself, I will become Petra. With that inner resolve, Peter crossed the hut to where John was standing, and sank to "her" knees and looked at John's magnificent cock eye to eye. With a sudden resolve, she/he snared the cock in her lips and plunged it down her/his throat as far as it would go. Her nose was buried firmly in the musky thatch of hair that crowned John's cock, and she inhaled deeply. Almost at that same moment, John's strong eruption splashed down her throat.

"Ah ... sorry ... oh ... my ... god ... there's something pushing me ... ah, ah, Oooooh," moaned John as an incredible orgasm ripped through his crotch. Six, seven, eight pulses, each as rich and strong as the first pulsed through his throbbing cock. Each pulse was met by an equally eager Petra as she eagerly welcomed the salty goodness down her throat. She wasn't sorry at all.

Danni had been unsure, at first, if it would work, but now, on the second morning, she had no doubts. Michelle/Michael had taken control of the two of them from the start, eagerly dominating both of them, but focusing her/his attention on Danni. She/he eagerly drank from Danni's breasts, lapped up her cum from her multiple orgasms, and then eagerly drank from Phoebe's quivering cunt as Phoebe suckled at Danni's flowing breasts.

Michael could feel his manhood developing with each sexual act. He remained ruthlessly focused on his physical journey, and it was easier and easier with each passing moment. He could feel his body shifting, his shoulders expanding, his hips narrowing, and his bulk increasing as he drank from Danni's breasts and cunt. All three of them ate ravenously from the store of dried fruits and fish, along with fresh fruit when Danni stumbled into the jungle to find some, drained as she was by Michael's intense efforts to change his sex. Michael seemed to benefit most from the fresh fruit, but more importantly, his growing size helped him focus on developing more power, more presence, and more stamina as both ladies pushed him to satisfy their own steadily increasing needs.

Phoebe was surprised by the changes Danni's milk caused. She was maturing quickly, her figure was filling out in all directions at once. She gained a few inches in height, her hair lengthened, her bust expanded, and her waist narrowed. Her hips became wide and womanly, no longer the slender, boyish hips of youth. Her nipples darkened and expanded, and her orgasms, as compared to the few she experienced previously, deepened and lengthened until she was truly a sexual creature equal to Danni. She was still a virgin, however.

Phoebe loved nuzzling with Danni, but she was growing increasingly eager to actually have sex with Michael. She enjoyed the frantically forceful attempts by Michael to penetrate her with his slowly developing cock, and she knew that such prolonged attempts were important to prompting Michael's transformation. She enjoyed the stimulation, but she wanted more. So far, it was still only a large clit, not the mature male penis she now craved. She watched with fascination as Michael slowly transformed from a middle-aged woman into a young, strong, and handsome male.

Later that second day, Phoebe was latched onto his still tiny cockette, as Michael drank from Danni's breasts, when he had his first intimations of a male orgasm. The nearly tasteless ejaculate was nevertheless sweet victory for all concerned. Phoebe wanted Michael to finish his transformation as much as Michael did. Despite her desire for Michael, she secretly still fantasized about John. Michael had gained some height, he was now about 6' 1", but he was not going to be as tall and broad as John. He probably wouldn't be as large "down there," she suspected, either.

The three of them had talked about what would happen when Michael and Phoebe were finished transitioning the next morning, since Michael seemed to be following the "normal" three-day period of transformation. Danni warned them that she would return to the beach, as she was eager to return to Pat and John. She told them that they would have the next morning to discover what it was to lose their virginity to one another. She made them promise to be slow and gentle with one another, but from the looks in both their eyes, such advice was likely to be ignored. They burned with lust for one another.

On the third morning, Michael was complete and Phoebe was no longer a child. Their ages equalized to the early mid-twenties, and Michael reveled in the feelings of youth and power that now flowed through his transformed body. The previous Michelle flexed himself before the same mirror that Patrick had once appraised himself of the changes his body was undergoing. He was about 6' 1" tall, muscular but not heavily muscled, almost no body hair, with dark grey eyes, jet-black hair, and a strong jaw. His pageboy had grown out somewhat, and now looked more appropriate, more masculine, almost romantic, Michael thought. He could see the generous curves of Phoebe under the covers of the bed in the reflection of the mirror, and he gloried in the rising of his first true hard on. It felt great, so strong, so stiff, and so virile. He practiced making it jump up and down, enjoying the air as it rushed past his sensitive head.

Phoebe watched with anticipation as Michael rose from the bed to check himself out in the mirror. Danni had stumbled down the mountain late last night, literally drained in her efforts to feed the both of them enough milk and cum to effect their transformations. As she lay there, pretending to be asleep, Phoebe thought that Michael was nearly the equal of John, but there was something she couldn't resist about that first moment she had seen John. Despite that strong memory, nothing was going to stop her from making love to Michael. Phoebe snuck a glance at her newly matured body, and reveled in her womanly curves. Her breasts had expanded to a full C cup, and her nipples were thick and chewy like Pat's. Her waist was narrow, and her hips were wide, while her pale skin and blonde hair in her crotch testified to her elfin features and Nordic coloring. Phoebe's breath gathered ragged steam as she set her sights on Michael's rising cock.

Michael turned from the mirror and caught Phoebe's eyes. He returned to the bed and lay down behind her, spooning her with his newly rampant cock pressing into the small of her back. Phoebe closed her eyes, taking in the sensations slowly: Michael's breath was warm and moist on her neck, their legs were tangled together, his arm loose around her waist. Phoebe slowly slid her hand down to his and brought it up to lightly cup her heaving breast.

She snuggled deeper into him, breathing in his masculine scent, feeling his cock throb against her back. Michael savored the feminine sweetness of Phoebe's neck and hair as she slowly moved her hips back against him. She felt herself getting wet. His hand began to lightly squeeze her breast, her nipple hardening against his palm. His tongue slid out along her neck, tasting, teeth nibbling. Phoebe felt a spreading of her juices along her thighs as he slide his torso lower, allowing his hardness to slip down between her now moist thighs.

Michael marveled at how rough his own hand felt against Phoebe's soft and smooth skin as he splayed across her stomach, holding her still, as he slowly slide into her. Her hotness was also a surprise, and he gasped with the newness of the sensation.

Phoebe's head pushed back against his neck, her face turning toward his to look into his eyes, as she felt every inch as he slowly entered her tight channel. They kissed as he gently but forcefully pushed past her maidenhead. Michael gasped again as he felt Phoebe's muscles flex tight around his thickness as he buried himself deep inside her, even as their mutual moans vibrated inside his mouth.

"That didn't hurt as much as I thought it would," Phoebe panted in between kisses.

"I remember ... remember, " Michael asked, kissing her back.

He lifted his head to watch Phoebe's face while he slowly pulled back out, gliding smoothly inside her. She nodded her understanding as she closed her eyes again so she could concentrate on the delicious feelings caused by his slow but steady pumping. His hand slid down her belly to her swollen lips, his fingers against her clit matching the slow, smooth rhythm of his cock sliding in and out of her. Yes, Michael understood the needs of a woman, but now he loved the feelings of confidence and control that coursed through him as he played Phoebe's body like a master musician. After one long thrust into her, Phoebe's hand shot back over his thigh, holding him tight against her quivering hips.

They lay still for several minutes, breathing deeply, until she calmed. Then they resumed the steady rhythm of his hips sliding his hardness slowly in and out of her tight, wet hole with long, slow thrusts. His lips moved against her shoulder and neck, kissing, biting, tasting her skin. Her hand rubbed against the back of his thigh, caressing his strong muscles with her fingers, clenching as the bulbous head of Michael's cock brushed her G-spot. Their soft moans filled the morning air.

He licked down her neck, biting her gently along the way to her shoulder, moving his hips a little faster, a little harder, thrusting faster, harder inside her, as he felt her grip him tighter, getting wetter. His fingers against her clit matched the rhythm of their hips. Her grip on his thigh grew tighter, her hips pushing back against him, trying to force his thrusting deeper.

Phoebe arched her neck, kissing Michael along his jaw, trying to consume this man who was making her feel such wonderful feelings. She reveled in his rough hands as he slid them down her soft and rounded thigh, lifting her leg back over his narrow hips. Her body rolled slightly, her left breast now up thrust, young, and firm, shaking with each stroke. Their breathing matched the quickening rhythm of their hips. Their lips crushed together again, tongues twisting, hot and wet. Phoebe hungrily sucked his tongue into her mouth, her teeth scraping against it. Then his lips slid against the front of her throat as he shifted his body above hers.

Phoebe countered by turning fully on her back, both breasts firm and quivering, reaching up towards Michael's swaying chest. His cock slowly pulled almost out of her as he raised her leg above him to lay it gently on his shoulder. He lifted her other leg to his other shoulder so that her knees were pressed into her breasts. Her hands reached up to cup his cheeks. Phoebe watched his face as he positioned himself above her, his body warm as he lowered it to hers. Whimpering with need, Phoebe pulled him down into a hungry kiss, his tongue sliding inside to taste her passion and urgency.

Michael slid his hands under her arms to wrap around the tops of her shoulders, tightly holding her in place, feeling the beginnings of his first male orgasm, as he began to thrust harder, deeper inside her yielding flesh. He knew he needed to be in control, but it was so hard, so hot, so powerfully overwhelming. He could taste her smell, feel her whimpers, and taste her raw need. It was the most intoxicating moment he had ever felt.

Her muscles squeezed around him, and she was getting wetter, her orgasm also building, her internal muscles clenching him tightly inside her. Phoebe's hips rose up to meet his, thrust for thrust, her muscles flexing around his cock as the first wave hit her hard. Crying out, her body arched up into him, her hips bucking as Michael thrust hard and deep inside. Michael's cock seemed to stretch and grow even further as her muscles clench tightly around him. But he remained in control.

As Phoebe came down, he gently kissed her, nibbling her lips. He had been patient. Now, it was his turn. Phoebe sensed his need as she ran her hands through his hair, holding his head, deepening the kiss, their tongues thrusting, their muffled moans filling each other's mouth. Phoebe felt him inside her, stretching her, filling her, getting harder, thicker, as his orgasm built. Her whimpering became nearly constant. Michael's hips slammed into hers with long, hard thrusts, pushing her deep into the mattress. Their eyes locked on each other, her nails biting into his upper arms, Phoebe cried out again. Her legs shaking against his shoulders as her second orgasm seized her to her core. Her muscles clamped tightly around his glorious cock, clenching, milking, pulsing, until Michael could hold back no longer. Phoebe felt him start to cum, shooting stream after stream inside her. Michael roared as he filled her, thrusting deep and hard, as he emptied himself into her.

They both lay, stunned, at the feelings they had experienced.

Petra had taken some of Pat's milk, and even tried licking her cum, but it was cock that she really wanted. After that first time, Petra held firm the vision of the woman he wanted to become, and after several more "feedings" from John during that first day; she knew she was well on her way.

By the second morning, Gail had regressed to her early thirties, more or less, and was filling out her gaunt and haggard frame. Her hair had turned a jet black, and her eyes were a light blue, almost aquamarine. The effect was stunning. She had never had an orgasm before her encounter with Pat, and now she couldn't get enough. Although she had started by suckling at Pat's magnificent breasts, she loved lapping at her sweet, hot, cunt. Pat assured her that any sexual fluid would probably work, and so they made it an experiment. Petra could drink from Pat's breasts while Gail lapped at Pat's cunt, and John would slowly fuck Gail from behind, completing the sexual circuit.

John would save his orgasm, however, for the insatiable Petra. She had taken Pat's advice on the speed with which changes would occur, and focused her oral attentions on John's magnificent Johnson. Throughout the second day, Petra could feel herself not only getting younger and more flexible, but also reshaping her body into something approximating her ideal woman.

It was her later afternoon feeding, she called it, pulling John up onto the beach where she and Gail had been floating in the water, trying to sooth their aching bones that were shifting and growing or shrinking. Petra was shrinking in some areas, but growing in others. Her arms, ribs, and feet noticeably shrank, while her hips exploded outwards and her legs lengthened. Her hair grew at an astounding rate, and even her nipples had dramatically changed. As she sank to her knees before John's ever ready cock, she was very much aware of how much she had changed.

Hers was now a classic hour-glass figure, and truth be told, she really did look like the Playboy original. She had only lost an inch or so, so she was probably the same height as the other Petra, and her shoulders were still broad when compared to Pat and Gail. But her back was dramatically feminine, and her ass that she settled over her feet was high and heart shaped. Her brown hair had thickened and now cascaded over her neck and upper shoulders. She slurped John into her mouth, and working with her customary efficiency, she brought him to the brink quickly. She squeezed the base of his cock, however, holding off the inevitable for just a bit while she smiled up at him.

"How am I doing?" she teased.

"Petra," groaned John, "if you don't finish me off, you'll get tossed out to sea for bait."

"Why would you do that to me," she cooed. "Don't you like my little titties?"

"I'm going to bet that they won't stay little long, but not if you don't ... oh, god, please," he sighed. "Not if you don't actually swallow my cum, you know."

"Oh, I know," she giggled. "I just want to savor it." And with that she plunged her mouth over his cock and released her grip. John almost fell to the ground in his release.

By the evening feeding, Petra's breasts had started in earnest, growing to a B cup, and Pat and John agreed that even though Peter hadn't started out looking anything like Petra, she had nevertheless blossomed in the transformation. Pat predicted that by morning Petra, if they ever got off this island, would be the twin of the original.

Petra lay among the tangled limbs of Gail, Pat, John, and herself, slowly stroking her growing breasts. After the "late evening feeding" they had grown even more, and were now past a C cup, with large chewy nipples, smaller than Pat's but getting there. She looked to be in her twenties, and so did Gail, whose breasts were gently pressed into her arm as she slept next to her. Gail's jet-black hair, aristocratic good looks, and lanky body thrilled her. She and Gail were exactly the same height, about 5' 10'' or 11'' the two tallest women on the island, unless Phoebe had grown significantly in her change. They would find out tomorrow, as everyone should be done changing.

Petra stroked her nipple to tightness, marveling at the sensation of a tight bud of passion quivering several inches off her ribs. She and Gail had experimented for the first time in between the two evening feedings. Her cock had disappeared by noon, and her womb had appeared late in the afternoon, but her birth canal and final arrangement of her internal organs were not yet complete. Tomorrow morning, she thought eagerly, even as she savored the feelings of being the exact same height as the beautiful Gail, their breasts pressed into each other's, while Petra expertly brought her to multiple orgasms. Sleep came slowly.

Gail knew she was done, and she was satisfied. Hell, she was thrilled. She appeared to be in her early twenties, had luxurious, jet black hair that curled down to her ass, large firm breasts, between a C and D cup, with nicely shaped nipples that puckered across the entire areolas, rather than just the nipple. Her nipple erections looked like small funnels perched on her round and full breasts, but the nipple itself only stuck out slightly from the surrounding erection. She liked it. It made her different from Danni, in addition to being a half a foot taller, who had returned in the middle of the night to burrow in between the sleeping Pat and John. She knew their bond was special, but it still made her feel excluded.

As she stretched in the morning sun, she reflected on the times had enjoyed her time with both Pat and Petra, and the occasional romp with John, but she really wanted to see Michael. She ached to see that the pain her sister had suffered was now eased by his hoped for transformation. The pure sexual energy that arose in her body as she imagined him also surprised her, but she welcomed the naughty implications. Yes, she was no longer the same woman she had been.

She decided, therefore, that Michael was going to be her first, sort of, now that she was complete, or as complete as possible. She lacked gills, but Pat assured her that in a few weeks, she would develop them as well. She walked along the beach in the early morning light, determined to let Petra discover herself with Pat, Danni, and John. She would wait for Michael.

Petra awoke with a slight shiver. Unlike the previous two mornings, no other body was pressed against her. Danni had returned in the night, and Pat, Danni, and John were entwined in a sleeping tangle of which she had no part. Gail was gone from the hut, and she imagined that Michael, whatever he looked like now, and Phoebe were now enjoying the fruits of transformation. She wished her niece well.

She sat up and took stock of her situation. She was complete, she knew, and like her niece (or so she still supposed, it WAS early after all), she was a virgin. Her long hair reached down to the small of her back, and it was thick and strong while still being soft and silky. Her waist was narrow and slender, and her long, very long legs gracefully extended beyond her shapely waist. Her breasts were larger than Pat's, and she gloried in their heavy weight, their tug at her collarbones and pectoral muscles. There was no ignoring Petra's breasts. They were enormous, double D or better.

She shook her shoulders just to feel them move, and then brought her hands up to the generous undersides of her breasts. She hefted each, feeling their weight, and sighed as her nipples tightened up with excitement. She was powerfully horny, but she didn't want to wake anyone. She couldn't stop stroking herself, pulling at her enormous breasts, feeling the sweet sensation of her nipples hardening in the morning air. She could feel her now complete pussy ooze her juices onto her thighs and butt.

She reclined back down with a soft sigh, one hand on a breast, the other buried in her crotch. The smell of her arousal was overwhelming.

Pat woke up first, and recognized the smell of Petra. She gave John a nudge with her hip as she slid over to the reclining Petra to suckle on her free breast. Petra gasped as Pat's soft lips captured her other nipple, pulling her breast into the air with power and passion. Petra arched her back into Pat's ministrations, pushing her generous breasts into the air. She soon felt John's powerful presence between her legs, putting his hands over her fingers as she stroked herself, making sloshing sounds with her labia and clit.

Danni gently lifted her hand from Petra's other breast, and joined Pat in a vigorous sucking of her breasts. She was delirious with pleasure. She brought both her hands to the backs of each girl's head, encouraging their morning ministrations on her soft, sensitive breasts. She barely noticed John repositioning himself between her legs, and she didn't notice his gentle guidance of her knees as he spread them further apart. Nor did she realize that her labia had "popped" as she spread her legs, opening herself to John's ready weapon. She was enjoying the feelings of her breasts being kneaded, suckled, pulled, and stroked by two experts in breast play.

Suddenly, her world exploded. John's thick, strong cock pushed inside the newly formed birth canal that Petra now possessed, eased by her steady flow of juices and aided by her own tilt of her pelvis to accept this large intruder. John met the resistance of her hymen, and pulled back slowly, rotating his hips, and letting his bulbous head twist in the entrance to her cunt. She was wild with need.

"Damnit, will you put it in," she demanded.

"You have to ask nicely," Pat advised, lifting her mouth from Petra's stiff nipple.

"Oh, my fucking god, will you please fuck me," Petra wailed.

"Anything my lady asks," John answered as he powered past Petra's brief virginity and sank to his hilt.

"Ohhhhhh," Petra moaned in pain and satisfaction. "Again."

John withdrew, and slammed it home a second time.

"Again," whispered Petra with less force and more need.

John complied, again , and again, and again ... until Petra lifted her legs around John's hips, and clenched his back as she shuddered through her first female orgasm. The feeling of the sweaty bodies writhing and rubbing through her climax was incredible. She didn't think she could maintain consciousness, but she hung on.

When she was done shaking, Danni, Pat, and John collapsed onto themselves, and Petra couldn't tell who was doing what to whom. She decided to leave them to their reunion, and shakily got to her feet. She found Gail outside the hut enjoying the morning sun and sat down beside her.

"They are having fun," she observed with irony as the moans and giggles floated past them as they sat naked and beautiful in the morning sun.

"Yes," Gail offered without turning her head from the east where she watched the sun rise over the left arm of the lagoon. "We will have our own family when Michael returns."

What surprised Petra was the fact that she actually felt a twitch in her cunt when Gail said that. She looked at Gail's dark, severe beauty, with her jet-black hair, her tall and strong figure, and her sinewy muscles. Yes, Gail was beautiful and compelling, and they were nearly the same height and size, Petra's stunning breasts were larger than Gail's, but Petra had no idea what Michael might look like, or how he would act. John was attractive, but there didn't be the same zing as Danni and Pat seemed to have for him ... or Phoebe, if she was honest with herself.

"When Michael comes down, I want you with me," Gail said, still without turning. "It will be my first time, and I want you there."

"Why," Petra asked.

"Because you tried to save us," Gail answered, turning to Petra. She reached out and pulled Petra into a kiss, and when they broke, with eyes shinning, she continued, "and because you are beautiful to me ... inside and out."

"You're beautiful to me too," Petra said. "I just tried to be as strong as you and Michelle."

"Michael," Gail answered with anticipation. "Besides, I want to make love to Michael in the water, not a prostitute's bed, and I'll need someone to hold my head above water."

It was shortly after breakfast when Michael and Phoebe arrived. Pat, Danni, and John returned to the hut as Gail and Petra cleaned up, but they came back out when they heard Gail's and Petra's squeals of joy as Michael and Phoebe emerged from the jungle onto the beach. The two tall dark haired ravens had tackled the equally tall and dark Michael at the edge of the beach and dragged him down to the water. Soon the three of them were locked in a passionate embrace that clearly spoke of a new bonding emerging.

Phoebe looked a bit lost as she watched the young man who had so recently taken her virginity cavort in the water with the two women who towered over her.

"Hey, what's up?" asked Danni as she slipped an arm around Phoebe while admiring the work the changes had done upon her.

"I thought it would be more ... something different," she whispered, still watching Gail, Petra, and Michael.

"Those two Amazons want a man who is the same size as they are," Pat giggled as she took Phoebe's other side. "I saw the way that you looked at John the first time you looked at him."

"Yea, and I saw the way that you looked at her," teased Danni.

"Your point?" asked Pat.

"Can I help it if I like my men tall and my women my height," she protested even as she raised herself on tippy toes to be the same height as Phoebe and Danni.

"Did you guys really do that," asked Phoebe incredulously.

"Yea, we did," answered Danni as she pulled Phoebe into a kiss that reached her bronchial passages.

Two months later, they were all floating in the sand bowl out in the middle of the lagoon, waiting out a terrible storm that lashed the surface above them. Their family units, or pods as they jokingly called themselves, had solidified into two groups: John with Pat, Danni, and Phoebe, and Michael with Gail and Petra. Everyone had developed gills, and they were all accomplished swimmers and hunter/gatherers. They spent most of their time in the ocean, venturing around the island from time to time, hoping to spot Alberto's men before they themselves were spotted.

They mixed their time between land and sea, and no further changes had yet been experienced, though Phoebe had noticed that John's, Pat's, and Danni's hands and feet had started to show signs of webbing. None of the others noticed, however, and so she kept it to herself.

The women of each pod found themselves on slightly different but unified cycles, Phoebe having merged with Pat and Danni's regular cycle, and Gail and Petra following in near perfect symmetry about two weeks later. Michael and John were able to function quite easily as long as they each had one of their "own" women with them, but they grew tense and aggressive when it was the two of them and a single woman. The girls figured out how their sexual systems worked, and simply arranged for someone to be with their man whenever a group meeting was needed or desired. For the most part, each pod kept to itself.

"This is the biggest storm we've seen since we got here," Pat observed.

"Yes, and who knows what it might wash ashore," John said ominously.

### 04 - A Mermaid's Tail

Sometimes, Pat hated being right. The scientist in her always wanted to be right, but the woman she had become, feared the conclusions she was reaching.

She stood on the ruined wreck of a sailing craft that had grounded ashore on their island's southeast shore, just on the other side of the lagoon in which the two pods had initially made their homes. John and Michael were lifting debris and remains off of the deck, which was riddled with bullet holes, while she and Gail searched for clues and salvageable items from the cabins. The craft had been abandoned for some time-they couldn't tell how long-and not much was useful. Most of the advanced electronic equipment had been smashed or shot through, and no one in the pods wore clothes any longer, so the clothes and other personal items were not useful either.

Actually, now that she remembered, she was right about Michael being right, which made it worse: some one else was right, too. When Michael was Michelle, he (she) had warned of a return of Alberto's men. It was fortunate that they had been preparing for this moment for the last several months.

Pat stopped reading the diary she had found in one of the cabin drawers, where this family had stowed some of their clothes, to brush a tear from her eye. She was crying for two reasons; first, she found herself feeling more and more emotional in recent months, feeling an ache for a "family" in ways the former man found new and troubling. Second, she and Michael had been right: the carnage they were sifting through was caused by Alberto Estanado, the drug lord from whom first Danni-and more recently Michael, Gail, Petra, and Phoebe-had managed to escape, through a great deal of luck, by coming to this island.

"Gail, look," she said, holding out the small book she had found under a jumble of boy's underwear and girl's bras and panties.

Gail walked over to her, picking her way among the broken furniture, smashed equipment, and torn clothes. Pat had come to appreciate Gail's quite strength and firm leadership. The former middle-aged missionary was now a far cry from the repressed, dumpy, and frigid lady she had been originally. Gail was tall, nearly a half a foot taller than Pat, and strong. Her bronzed skin rippled with muscles, reminding her of Lucy Lawless. Gail never bossed anyone around, but her physical and mental focus was nearly as overpowering as John's sheer physical size. Gail took the book from Pat, and skimmed through it quickly. It looked like a girl's diary, full of doodles, pictures from magazines, poems, sketches, pictures of the doomed family, dreams, and dares. The last few pages, however, were a quickly scrawled litany of horror.

From this new evidence, they now knew that the sailing craft had belonged to a family of five: parents with triplets, two daughters and a son, all teenagers. When they first started searching through the wreckage nearly an hour ago, they couldn't tell who or how many people had been on the boat. The birds had feasted on the remains while the boat drifted towards the shore. No pictures remained in the cabin, and there were at least three human remains on the deck, but they were so badly eaten away or decomposed, their sexes, ages, and even their sizes were practicably indistinguishable. The diary confirmed these facts and more.

Alberto's men had pirated the boat, killed their father, and raped their mother. The two teenaged girls were to be sold for prostitution, while the boy was to be saved for "something special." The diary ended there. No word on what happened to the boy, whose named appeared to be Martin. Gail guessed that one of the two girls was the author, either Ricki, or her twin sister, Cleo. They were probably on their way to Thailand or Singapore to be sold into prostitution, maybe even their unnamed mother as well. Pat's gut twisted, and her eyes misted again.

Pat's feelings towards Danni, Phoebe, and John were as lovers, but she knew that some day, children were inevitable, especially considering how much sex everyone was having. Still, it had been several months since the arrival of The Argo and the addition of Michael, Gail, Petra, and Phoebe to their island, and no one had yet skipped a period. Pat suspected it was because their bodies had not yet finished transitioning into their final forms. She had noticed that John, Danni, and herself had developed delicate webbing in between their fingers and toes, but she wasn't sure it how much further beyond that it would go. In any event, she didn't want her paradise to be continually under threat from this madman.

Gail's normally severe beauty tightened even further as she read the diary. Alberto had tormented her and her "then" sister, Michelle, for months before they, and Phoebe and her "then" Uncle Peter had managed to escape, accidentally, to this island. Now Michael, Petra, and herself formed the other family pod to John and his girls. Michael had proven himself a talented and capable lover for both she and Petra, though Gail could tell that Michael felt something special for Petra, who returned his fervor with extra emphasis. Gail loved Michael, but her body and emotions responded to Petra, though she knew that Petra was head over heels in love with Michael.

As a result, Gail found a sense of purpose as she became the level headed master of tactics, resources, and action for both groups. Pat was the scientist-mom of the group; John was the bodyguard, the tallest, and strongest of all. Danni was the playful cheerleader, while Phoebe was the studious youth, following in Pat's footsteps. Petra was the sensuous mother-goddess, while Michael was Gail's warrior, able to understand her with a flick of an eye, and together they were ruthless. Both pods had enjoyed many a shark steak seared over a beach fire as the result of their efforts.

For the last several months, both pods divided their time between the ocean and the land, with their days mostly in the water, and their nights mostly on the land. Pat had hypothesized that prolonged exposure to the water would change their bodies so much that moving around on the land might be difficult, and every one had agreed such a change was likely. Phoebe was the only one who actually talked about wanting to become a mermaid, and despite the many talks Pat had with her about the likelihood of the changes they were undergoing to result in the aesthetically pleasing, mythical "mermaid" of yore, she wouldn't give up on her dream.

Under Gail's strong leadership, they had more thoroughly explored their island for geographic features useful for hiding, hunting, and protecting themselves. Pat and John had mapped the island for botanical and animal life when they first arrived over a year ago, but the two men (then) hadn't been concerned about defending themselves or the island from drug/prostitution pirates. Now, they had found an extensive system of interconnected caves on the western edge of the island, where the volcano above dropped into the sea in a sheer cliff. The southern island had a large land shelf with several lagoons, of which theirs was the largest, and a system of coral reefs off shore that curved around to the east of the island. The eastern and northern slopes were not the sheer cliffs of the western island, but eased gently towards the sea in a series of rocky coves spotted with small, white beaches, and rocky outcroppings. There were caves here too, but not so numerous or as interconnected as those to the west.

They had spent the last two weeks moving most of the equipment from the mountainside and beach huts to the caves in the west, which could only be accessed via underwater passageways, old magma tunnels that had cooled and which now stretched deep into the mountain with hundreds of twists and turns. There was one cave, deep in the system, that had a large chimney with a nearly invisible opening not too far from the hot tub John and Pat had built on promontory mid-way up the southwestern side of volcano. John's pod had carefully lowered the equipment and records that might get damaged by the sea down this chimney to Michael's pod, who then redistributed it among the dry shelves and rooms that opened along various twists and turns of the tunnels of water that they had now mapped, and in which they built their new homes.

Petra had been floating in a pool that was in a room next to the "chimney room" after helping Gail and Michael lug another load from that room to several of the various caves they had designated for each function (the lab, the library, Michael's pod's bedroom, John's pod's bedroom, etc.,), when she discovered that the seemingly solid volcanic rock that formed the vaulted arch of this small space was actually riddled with holes that apparently snaked throughout the island.

If she was still, she could hear Pat and John talking as they passed the hot tub, Danni muttering to her self at the mountainside camp several hundred yards around the mountain, and even Phoebe's antics in the caves and coves at the eastern side of the island (where she was supposed to be collecting information on the size and shape of all the major inlets on that side, but was playing with dolphins instead). She called out to Michael and Gail, and they listened as well. Gail then formulated a plan that she shared with Pat and John when they brought the next load to the chimney to map out where all the "listening tubes," as Petra called them, went. They had finished mapping about twenty or so clear listening tubes that covered most of the island, when the boat had washed ashore that morning.

As Pat watched Gail process the diary and its contents, her mind drifted to her own family pod. John was her oldest and best friend, and more recently, her lover. Danni an unexpected bonus, but her sunny disposition and frank eagerness for sex had made her an essential balance to her own bookishness and John's "strong and silent" type. Their newest "sister/wife" was Phoebe, who had been a water nymph growing up near the Gold Coast of Australia. She had probably spent more time in or on the water than she had on the land in her childhood. She was a natural in the water, swimming nearly as fast and as effortlessly as Michael or John, who were each twice as strong as she was. Despite her dreams of becoming a mermaid, she accepted the leadership of Gail and Pat, and spent each night, like the rest of them, on land-at first on the huts on the beach, and more recently in the caves to which they had moved. Pat loved each one of them immensely.

She knew what the diary meant: some day those men would show up here. She was a scientist, not a general. She felt helpless and angry.

Gail put the diary down, and gave another cursory look around the cabin. "We won't likely find anything more that is useful, though I promised Petra I would bring back any clothes that looked like they might fit her."

"Clothes?" Pat asked.

"She used to be a cross-dresser," Gail added. "Remember?"

Pat nodded. Pat was herself an accidental, though very happy new woman, whereas Petra had dreamed of becoming one for years. Now that she finally had the body to die for, she was on a tropical island spending all of her time naked-not especially satisfying for a former cross-dresser. Pat helped Gail go through the drawers, and found a few things that might fit the voluptuous Petra. Apparently, the mother of this tragic family was of a similar build to Petra, whereas the girls were still teenagers, though bikini's that belonged to the girls were still a full C cup. Petra, however, was a DD with some extra change thrown in for good measure. Together, they filled a small suitcase with bikinis and lingerie, and went out onto the deck.

Michael and John had finished cleaning and sorting the debris on the deck. Like the cabin, nothing was useful, most of it deliberately destroyed. They had discovered that the two of them worked well as a team when they were alone together or when they each had a sister-wife with them. It was only when it was three of them, the two men and one woman, when the nearly uncontrollable urges towards violence and aggression arose.

"We found a diary," Gail reported.

"And?" John asked in his usual loquacious manner.

"Alberto," Pat answered.

"This is not good news," Michael said as he scanned the horizon as though Alberto's men would suddenly appear.

"We should get back to the lagoon and make some plans," Gail suggested.

"What about the boat?" asked Pat. "Shouldn't we try to get rid of it or something?"

"No, it's too big to move," Gail said, looking things over. "And a fire would signal to anyone watching that there was human activity on this island. We should just leave it here."

"The next storm may take care of it," John said. "If we're lucky."

The four of them climbed down the side of the boat and headed back towards the lagoon. They had a lot of planning to do.

It was Phoebe's turn to "man" the hot tub lookout that day. She could see the small specks of John, Pat, Michael, and Gail as they trotted back across the eastern arm of sand and palm trees that formed the northeastern boundary of their large lagoon. Beyond them, the sea was calm, and empty.

She thought back to the first time John, Pat, and Danni had taken her to this hot tub a few weeks ago. It had been a beautiful evening, a clear night with the Milky Way glowing visibly across the southern sky. All three of them had lavished her with attention for the better part of two hours, and when they were through with her, she lay limply in the warm water for another hour watching the three of them frolic and play before she could rejoin them. John seemed to have endless stamina, which suited the three girls just fine. Phoebe sighed as her nipples stiffened at the memory.

She looked down at her vastly changed body. When she arrived she was starving, skinny, and a teenager. Now, she was womanly, well fed, and well loved. She lifted a delicate finger to her stiff nipple, and gave it a small squeeze, prompting a small offering of her milk. God, that felt so wonderful, she thought to herself. All the girls were now producing milk on demand, which had saved Phoebe a nasty cut on her calf from the coral. Danni had simply squeezed a drop or two from her breasts onto Phoebe's leg, and the deep scrape healed within an hour without a trace. She licked her breast and tasted her own milk. It was sweet and warm. Her could feel her gills along her back reaching into the hot tub, which only added to her feelings of sensuousness and femininity. She had grown up in Australia where popular culture had idolized mermaids, and many women "practiced" being mermaids with latex or fabric tails in the warm tropical waters of the Gold Coast where she had lived. They weren't real mermaids, of course, but there were no such things as mermaids, right?

Not for Phoebe. She was a mermaid in her imagination, a beautiful creature of mystery, myth, and the sea. Her other hand slowly snaked down her torso towards her crotch. She loved the way her body could stimulate Pat, Danni, and John-and herself, on occasions like this one. She continued to milk one breast, pulling it up to her eager mouth as milk oozed forth, while running her other hand over her stomach and flanks. Her body was so similar to Danni's and Pat's, but she was the only one who had been born a girl. She giggled at the memory of her transformation from a skinny teen to a voluptuous woman with Danni's help. She imagined she was again drinking >from those amazing breasts, with those long nipples. She collected the milk she herself had produced on her finger, and sucked on it as though it was Danni's nipple. She knew she was the only one who wanted to continue the transformation, and she didn't know why the thought excited her so much.

She ran her hands along her waist, imagining that a beautiful mermaid's tail actually started there, decorated by flecks of color and light as her own skin transitioned from soft, feminine flesh to shiny, undulating scales. Her hand stroked downward to "feel" her tail, but was interrupted by the light tuft of hair at the top of her vagina. It was a worthy reminder of what she did have, and she began flicking gently at her clit. Her other hand continued to tug on her turgid nipples, seeking to make her breasts ooze more of the white milk that seemed to be the key to all these changes. As her arousal grew, her breasts swelled with her passion, and the water in the hot tub began to slosh and splash as her body responded to her self love. She pointed her legs across the water, as she imagined that the flesh colored webbing she could see starting to form between John's, Pat's, and Danni's fingers had spread to her own, but instead was an iridescent blue, and she imagined that her legs were a long, graceful tail with power, grace, and beauty shimmering like a rainbow in the hot tub. Her fingers blurred at her crotch, while her breast spurted three streams of milk, one of which landing on her face and neck. She pulled again at her breast, and succeeded at getting a stream to hit her mouth cleanly. The sweetness was delicious, and she imagined her own milk coursing through her body, changing her. She cried out as the image and her orgasm collided, and tremors of pleasure coursed through her body.

When she recovered sufficiently so that she could open her eyes, Phoebe saw the spots along the horizon that signified they would be having visitors within a few hours.

Normally, they wouldn't have walked back, but Gail wanted to keep the clothes dry for Petra. So, John, Michael, and Pat all walked back with her. Petra, nee Peter the former cross-dresser, had transformed into a nearly exact replica of the Playboy playmate from the early 90s, Petra Verkaik, though this Petra was a bit taller than the original. Petra shared the same lanky build, however, the same unexpectedly large and lush breasts, and the same dramatic, arched beauty in her face and eyes. She and Gail were the exact same height, but Gail was a true Amazon, all angles and power, whereas Petra was curves and softness.

They made a good pair, Michael thought to himself as he watched Petra run up the beach to embrace her sister-wife. He didn't know how to convince Gail that he loved them both deeply, but he knew that he would continue to try. Making love to Petra was like wallowing in softness and squeals, whereas Gail was a tigress, fierce and quiet, matching him stroke for stroke, taking her orgasms with control, seeking to cum with purpose. Petra, on the other hand, gave herself completely over to the overwhelming power of sex, often losing consciousness from the rolling waves of her multiple orgasms.

Danni waved from the beach hut, as the five of them walked up the beach. They arrived at the hut just as Phoebe breathlessly emerged from the jungle trail leading up to the mountainside huts.

"Boats," she said urgently. "At least two."

"Where?" snapped Gail?

"South-south east," Phoebe reported. "On the horizon, they looked to be standard fishing-pleasure yachts."

"They won't get here, if they are headed here, until nightfall," Pat concluded.

"Right," Gail said with determination. "Let's put this plan into action."

"Now?" asked John. "Do you think they are headed here?"

Pat and Gail held each other's eyes for a long moment, and then they turned to the other girls and held their gaze in silence.

"Women's intuition," Michael whispered conspiratorially to John. "I used to know a thing or two about that."

"You sure?" asked John, chucking him on the shoulder. "Lately, you're as bad as I am."

"Yea," Michael said with a feral grin. "Isn't that great?"

The girls sighed collectively.

"It's them," Gail reported.

"We can all sense it," Pat finished.

"Well, you're the bosses," John said, waving at Gail and Pat.

"Petra and Michael, head for the Home Caves and get ready to receive the last of our stuff down the chimney," Gail ordered. "Pat, can you and Michael collect the last of our stuff here and haul it up to the chimney?"

"We're on it," Pat and John said in unison.

"Phoebe, I need you to come with me," Gail smiled. "We're going to prepare some surprises for our guests."

Petra could barely contain her excitement. She was wearing a bikini, and it looked spectacular! She felt a twinge of guilt as she thought of the original owner of the bright pink suit, but she put that thought aside; she could do nothing about the past. She reveled in the weight of her large breasts, as they pulled at the strap around her neck, and the way the bikini forced her bulging breasts together in a deep and warm cleavage.

"Petra," Phoebe asked from down the passageway, "have you put all of your pod's stuff away?"

"Yes," she answered. "I'm just trying on some clothes."

Phoebe turned the corner to see Petra, her former Uncle Peter but who was now her same biological sex and age, posing along side one of the hundreds of tidal pools that were all interconnected in this Swiss cheese system of caves and tunnels.

"You look beautiful," she said. "I spent most of my youth wanting to go to the nude beach so I didn't have to wear a swim suit, and you ... "

"Waited my whole life to have to wear one," Petra giggled. "And now that I can, but there's no need."

"Doesn't your back hurt?" Phoebe asked as she noticed the straining straps to Petra's bikini top. Petra's breasts were nearly level with her chin, as Petra's 5' 11' frame towered over Phoebe's 5' 6''.

"No," Petra answered. "Why do you ask?"

"The straps," Phoebe prompted. "My gills are so sensitive, I can't imagine tying anything across them."

"Oh," Petra smiled and turned, showing Phoebe where she had taken a folded silk blouse to cushion the lower strap as it crossed her gills.

"That kinda means we can't wear clothes that cross our backs." Phoebe said.

"Yes, I am afraid so," Petra answered. "Even with this super soft silk, I can still feel where the tie digs into me. I just wanted to try it once."

"Don't pout," Phoebe urged, coming over to hug her former uncle. "You have the most beautiful breasts here, and it would be a shame to cover them."

"Oh, Phoebe," Petra breathed, "I know all this has been really strange, and really difficult, but I am so happy now."

"I am too, Petra," Phoebe admitted. "I feel like I've lost a kind and sweet uncle, along with the rest of our family, but I've gained a beautiful and caring sister."

"Or cousin," Petra said with a sly smile. "A kissing cousin?"

Phoebe started ... she hadn't really thought about that ... kissing Peter/Petra? Why did that thought appeal to her? She struggled internally for a moment before Petra put the matter to rest.

"Kissing cousins," she said firmly as she lifted Phoebe's face with her hands and bent down to kiss her deeply.

Phoebe physically enjoyed the kiss, and the pressure of Petra's enormous breasts filling the space between the tops of her own and her chin, but emotionally, she was thinking of Danni and Pat. She wondered how all this would work itself out. Petra too enjoyed the gentle tease of naughty thoughts that played across her imagination as she kissed her surprised former niece, but she also felt the emotional tug of her bonds to Michael and Gail.

"Perhaps more someday?" Petra asked.

"Perhaps," Phoebe answered with a smile.

The next morning, Pat, Danni, and Phoebe were pouring through the diary in the Chimney Cave, reading by the sunlight that cascaded down from above, trying to learn all they could about the family that had met a terrible end, dangling their feet into the pool in the center of the room. Gail, who had been manning the listening tubes the previous evening, reported that the boats had reached the abandoned sailboat on the eastern arm after sunset, but everyone must have stayed aboard. No new sounds or voices had been heard.

John pulled up through the pool in the middle of the room with a powerful kick, and landed with a thud next to Pat at the edge of the pool.

"You're getting to be quite the swimmer," she remarked as water sluiced off John's shining skin and hair.

"They are making landfall even now, and they should find the remains of our beach camp shortly," he reported.

"Could you see who they were?" Phoebe asked.

"I stayed at the point, keeping watch," John explained, "while Michael went in for a closer look. He should be right behind me."

Michael burst through the tunnel below their feet and, like John, leapt up-dolphin style-to land next to John. "It's them," he said simply.

"How many?" asked Gail as she burst into the room, followed quickly by Petra.

"At least two dozen, mostly men, well armed, and a few women," he reported. "There also appeared to be five captives, including those three," he said pointing at the photograph in the diary that Pat held on her lap.

"Really," cried Phoebe. "Ohmygod! Who were the other two, their parents?"

"No," Michael replied with a sigh. "They appeared to be Asian girls, young, looked Chinese."

"We HAVE to help them," Phoebe urged, remembering her own time of captivity.

"Yes," Gail said calmly. "We do."

Pat knew better than to argue with Gail when she spoke in that tone of voice. So, she did one better. "Then we are going to need information," she said quietly, "a lot of information."

"We should be hearing from them shortly," Gail replied, with a sly smile to Michael.

"Yes," Michael said to Gail's smile, "I set the trip wires as soon as I knew who they were."

"What do you mean?" asked Petra just as a distant explosion echoed down their chimney. Everyone looked at the patch of sky above as though they might actually see the smoke from the explosion.

"Gail," asked Pat with a sly grin. "What kind of surprises did you leave for our guests?"

"Oh, just some things that Phoebe, Michael, and I whipped up, nothing special," Gail said with a fierce grin that no one thought was supposed to be funny.

The criminals had found the old beach camp, and had assumed that it had been long abandoned. When they crossed the dilapidated threshold of the hut, the two men who had been carrying supplies from the boat to the hut disappeared in a violent explosion. When the smoke had cleared, everyone was on high alert. The captives were put back on the main boat, and Alberto had them all locked in a small cabin until he could sort things out. He marshaled his men, and two women who were members of his gang, into three search parties with strict instructions to search the island carefully, watching for booby traps.

They spent the next three days combing through the island, finding several nasty surprises that Gail, Michael, and Phoebe had left for them. Some worked great, like the one on the family's boat that had drifted ashore. The other half of the gasoline that was left on the boat made for an equally fine explosion as the one at the beach hut. Two men lost their lives there, and one of the women was burned, but not badly. Some didn't work so well, like the one at the mountainside camp: that only cost one of the men a finger.

Alberto and his men had learned to fear the island, but they couldn't be sure if anyone was still there, especially as they could circle the island, more or less, in a single day. They were hoping to lie low for a few weeks, and let the heat die down from various law enforcement agencies looking for them. He and his gang were based mostly in the Philippines, but they did business from Shanghai to Sydney. This tiny, remote island was as good a hideout as any, and it didn't appear on any of the nautical maps. However, the old booby traps that were set for someone were an unpleasant surprise.

The Henderson's boat had been another unpleasant surprise. Alberto had thought it sank weeks ago, but finding it here seemed a bad omen, one that had turned out to be true. Some one had deliberately set those booby traps, which meant that some one was on the island within the last month. He wanted to leave, but he couldn't. The two large yachts in which the gang had arrived had only enough gas for the next jump to Palau. If they spent time searching for yet another of the over 600 small, volcanic islands in the South Pacific, they might run out of gas and be stranded.

On the plus side, the lagoon was perfect, and new beach huts were easily and quickly constructed. Soon, the remaining 15 members of the gang, plus their five captives, were lodged comfortably, if warily, in seven new beach huts along the lagoon. Satisfied that they had found or tripped most of the booby traps, they settled down to wait for either the return of those who had set the traps, or the heat to die down so they could resume their activities. Alberto thought two months or so should do the trick. In the mean time, the two Henderson girls and the two Chinese girls would provide him and a select few of his men some recreation. The boy, on the other hand, served the needs of two of his men who were so inclined to enjoy the fruits of young boys.

That was their lagoon, damnit!

Pat was fuming as she swam back to the caves after reconnoitering the activities in the lagoon. Those bastards were soiling their lagoon, with their loud nights, drunken brawls, and gunshots into the sky. God damn them! They could hear the cries of the teenagers each time one of the gang members took them, even the boy. His screams were the worst. She wanted them dead and gone, but they couldn't do much until they could figure out how to rescue the five teenagers without getting themselves or the children killed.

The two pods were beginning to feel their own form of cabin fever. It had been nearly a month since Alberto and his men had arrived. The pods had to be very careful during the day, and so they missed the sunlight. They had been cooped up, more or less, for over three weeks, and they were beginning to get on edge. They all took long swims on the west and northern sides of the island, but there were few places safe to make landfall, or even rocks on which to sun themselves. They knew that only a small portion of beach was invisible to any lookouts high on the mountain. They stayed out of the lagoons on the south side during the day for the same reason. Their bodies would be visible in the crystal clear water to any clear eyed lookout, and they knew from the listening tubes that Alberto had someone at the hot tub nearly 24 hours a day.

They had taken to eating almost entirely from the sea, in part, because they didn't seem to need any fresh water if they ate seaweed, raw fish, and shellfish, and in part, because they knew that their stores of dried fruit and fish couldn't last as long as Alberto's men could survive on the bounty of the island now denied to them. And, no one wanted to give away their position by making a fire. Alberto's men had guns; whereas they only had knives, and too few of them. Quickly, however, they got used to a diet of fresh seafood and sea grasses. Phoebe loved it. But she was the only one. Everyone, even Phoebe, wanted the gang gone and their island back.

It was a full moon, and Michael's pod were spying on the lagoon, watching the beach for any activity, and hoping for the rare opportunity to capture one of Alberto's men. Petra didn't like such tasks, but she did keep watch with her two pod mates. She wasn't there two weeks ago when one of Alberto's men had decided to take a midnight swim, alone. Many of the men and the two women had gone swimming at night, but Gail could hardly believe her eyes as she lay hidden among the palm fronds on the western arm of the lagoon when she saw a lone man enter the water. She silently slipped into the water and swam to the eastern arm to rouse Michael from his watch, but-as was usual for the two of them-he had had the same idea and they met in the middle of the lagoon's opening to the reefs off shore.

When the gang had discovered the body of their comrade the next morning, they wondered what kind of fish could have breached the barrier reefs to inflict such horrific damage to a human body. No one had gone swimming alone again.

Petra had cried over the cuts on Gail's and Michael's legs from where they had fought with the man under water, as they dragged him down to the coral reefs. She was grateful that her generous breasts could help heal her pod mates, and she was determined not to let her own distaste for violence prevent her from being with her pod. Neither Gail nor Michael ever suggested or pressured her to participate, but she could tell that they both were grateful that she had joined them on their patrols. In truth, both Michael and Gail had come to depend on Petra's gentle nature to balance their own, and her welcoming kisses and caresses eased their long simmering painful memories.

Back in the caves, John's pod had gathered in the chimney room, unable to sleep, and this was the only room in which any light appeared. The moon slowly slipped across the sky until to was directly above the chimney opening. The effect was stunning, casting a perfect reflection onto the surface of the pool in the center of the room. As one, John and the girls slipped into the water and sank into the pool. It was a large pool, about 15 meters wide, nearly a perfect circle, and about 30 meters deep, with many different tunnels that branched off of the pool in several directions, the largest tunnel leading almost directly to the sea, about 100 meters to the west.

The four of them floated in the pale, otherworldly light, holding hands and entwining their feet as they clung close to each other.

"This is beautiful," marveled Phoebe. "We should call this the Moon Pool."

"You are all beautiful," said John as he gazed at each of them.

"It's been ages since we made love," Danni said quietly into the pool.

"I know," sighed Pat. "Alberto's men have put a damper on many things."

"I'm not going to let them win that fight," Phoebe said, and put action to issue by sinking down to John's cock, and sucking it into her mouth. John responded quickly, and soon he was at full erection. Danni and Pat joined their pod mate at John's crotch, while John looked at these beautiful women who swirled in the water below him, stroking his legs with their hands and sharing his stiff cock among the three of them. Pat's rich auburn hair had lost some of her red highlights during the past four weeks of hiding, but it still shone in the moonlight like a beacon. Danni's golden hair was matched by Phoebe's nearly white blonde mane, and he enjoyed the beginnings of his first orgasm building up pressure behind his balls.

Pat looked lovingly at her pod mates and at John's stiff cock that reached nine inches into the water, nearly as thick as her wrist. She shared a deep kiss with Phoebe as Danni took John into her mouth, then stroked Phoebe's breasts as she had a turn, and then was stroked by Phoebe as she took John back into her own mouth. She loved the warmth of John's body, his strength and size, and she loved the gentle caresses from Phoebe and Danni as she stroked her lover's cock. She looked up to John's eyes as he floated above them, and sucked hard on his sensitive head. Her efforts, as she suspected, were instantly rewarded as John spurted into her mouth. One, two, three big pulses in quick succession, then two smaller ones.

She kept John's salty goodness in her mouth, savoring his heat, and turned to the girls, who attacked her face and lips, eager for a taste of their own. When they had shared John's gift, they guided Phoebe up to John's face, his still stiff cock poking her in her crotch. Pat floated behind John, pulling Phoebe's legs apart and holding them on either side of John's waist, while Danni pressed herself into Phoebe's back, reaching between her and John to guide his stiff pole into Phoebe. Both John and Phoebe simply floated while Pat and Danni did all the work. Pat and Danni locked their legs together and pressed their soft breasts into John's and Phoebe's gills. With their hands they guided Phoebe's hips back and forth, stroking John's cock against her clit and G-spot, and she lasted only a few moments before shaking violently in her orgasm, milk spurting from her breasts. Then it was Danni's turn, and she too only lasted a few minutes before she was groaning in her own orgasm. Then it was Pat's turn.

Pat let herself go limp, giving all power of movement to the other girls as she felt Danni's long nipples poking her in her gills. An involuntary tremor ran through her body as she felt Danni's hands hold her wide hips steady, while Phoebe's gentle touch on her ankles pulled her legs around John's strong, slender waist. She gazed lovingly into John's eyes as she felt the flowering of her sex as John's stiff penis pushed past her outer lips. Then the girls froze. Only the tip of John's magnificent penis was inside her, and she wanted more ... she needed more. She twitched her hips, trying to force more of him inside her without actually moving herself, which was not part of this game.

"Uh, oh," whispered Danni into her ear, nibbling on her lob, "You know the rules. Let us do it."

"Please ... " Pat whimpered as John brought his hands up to her breasts, softly rubbing and pulling on her nipples. "Aaaaaahhhh ... please."

Pat loved the way her breasts felt full and heavy with passion, nearly to the bursting, as John pushed, pulled, and caressed her breasts. Danni's hands on her hips rose up to Pat's slender waist and caressed her stomach, teasing at the tufts of hair at the top of her vagina. Phoebe pulled a tiny bit on her legs, and John sank another inch into her. Pat concentrated on letting her lovers make love to her, and she relaxed into the delicious tension that was building in her abdomen. Phoebe pulled again, and John gasped as his head pushed past Pat's engorged G-Spot. Pat admired the soft glow of moonlight on John's chest and face; she was so in love. Phoebe pulled again, and Pat's legs began to quiver even as she struggled not to move. Pat could see the teasing vixen's hair floating behind John's broad shoulders, and she knew that Phoebe was pushing her breasts into John's gills, making him quiver in pleasure. Phoebe pulled again, and John's shaft was now over halfway in, and Danni could feel Pat's internal muscles jumping and twitching as she applied pressure to Pat's womb with her hands. Phoebe pulled again, and John's shaft swelled as he fought to hold back his own orgasm. Phoebe pulled again, and they were joined. Pat's clit was tingling, throbbing, aching to be rubbed, but Danni and Phoebe held them frozen in place.

John's hands had stopped moving and were clenched on Pat's breasts as he focused on not cuming. His face was twisted with effort. Pat gazed down at her breasts, captured by John's strong hands, her nipples straining into the water, milk oozing from one in anticipation of the orgasm that was hurtling towards her like a steam engine roaring down the tracks. She saw her own belly twitching under Danni's gentle pressure, and could even see where her lips had stretched around John's massive cock as it throbbed within her. They hung there for an eternity, it seemed, when John let out a shout into the water, bubbles rising to the surface, as his cock exploded into her.

As the first pulse of cum shot through his cock, Pat could feel the swell of effort as it throbbed through his penis like a golf ball through a hose. When his hot cum splashed on her cervix, she could hold back no longer, and her orgasm rose from her depths like storm, wracking her body with pleasure, making her quiver like a tuning fork as Danni and Phoebe held them together, locked in their loving embraces. And she could feel the sudden release in her breasts as she spurted milk into the water as she shuddered again and again, moaning into the water.

The next morning the two pods were back in the chimney room, discussing what Michael's pod had seen. The men were erecting huts that were more permanent, and it seemed as though they were hunkering down for a long stay. Now the two pods were sitting around dejected. They only had a few knives for weapons, and despite being strong swimmers who could breath underwater; it had been a near miss for Michael and Gail to drag one of Alberto's men under the surf. Since the gang members never swam alone, and the captive teenagers were always guarded, they didn't know how they were going to change the balance of power.

But, it was later that morning when John, who had been out foraging for food, changed the dynamic of this cat and mouse game they were playing when he shot up out of the newly christened "Moon pool" and plopped next to Pat sitting at the edge of the pool.

"Look," he said calmly. "My hands are changing."

Pat looked at his hands and then at the silent friends and lovers that sat all around the pool. Everyone was looking at John's hands. The webbing had risen nearly to his fingernails, and his hands seemed larger. Pat rolled his hands in hers, comparing their webbing. She too had noticed the slightly accelerated speed at which this new development was occurring. She wondered if their activities last night had had any effect. Danni moved her own hands over to theirs before Pat could ask. Soon, everyone was holding his or her own hands out for comparison.

Petra, who spent less time in the water than anyone else, had the least amount of webbing. Pat and John, who had been under the effects of the goop the longest, were the most advanced. Danni was only slightly behind John and Pat, but Michael, Gail, and Phoebe, all of whom spent nearly all their time in the water, spying on Alberto and his men and collecting food for the others, were the same as Danni.

"Length of exposure to the goop and the types of behavior we engage in seem to influence what each of us are undergoing," she concluded.

"What does this mean?" asked Petra with a gulp.

"If we keep this up, this hiding and being in the water all the time," Pat said without emotion, "we will keep on changing into whatever this goop has in store for us."

"No, we won't," Phoebe said firmly.

"Why do you think that?" asked Pat with a raised eyebrow.

"Because, Petra didn't just change ... she made herself change into someone she wanted to become," she said. "Michael too! I'll be right back," she said as she dove into the pool and swam down one of the several tunnels that fed this central cavern.

"I don't want to become a fish," Petra said fearfully, "I just became a woman, and I don't want to change that."

"No one wants to become a fish," Pat said patiently, "But we are all becoming something."

"I'd like to see what Phoebe wants?" Gail said evenly. "I would rather try to actively influence our changes than simply wait for them happen while we hid here in these caves."

"I would too," said Michael, giving Gail's hand a squeeze.

Phoebe rushed back through the water, popped up and slid to a stop like a dolphin next to Pat.

"Here, look at these pictures," Phoebe said enthusiastically as she took the book out from the plastic bag she had sealed it within. "That's what I want to become."

The picture was the classic 19th century picture of the beautiful mermaid, gazing out to sea, wishing her sailor would return. Her golden tail curled beneath her, and her hourglass figure, even for the 19th century, was beautiful. Her long, curly, dark hair cascaded down her back. She was a beautiful creature. Her tail had two sets of fins at her pelvis and at mid-tail, while her flukes were wide and strong.

"See, it looks like these tails actually work, and they are still beautiful," Phoebe urged.

"Why not still keep our ability to walk?" asked Pat.

"Because," Gail said with new insight, "we can dominate and fully control one environment, the water, if we give ourselves the power to do so. We would have sea power; they would have land power. They have guns, which don't work underwater," she finished with a smile.

"I think they're just plain beautiful," Petra said. "I didn't want to be a fish, but I do want to be one of those."

"I still don't think we can do it," Pat said.

"I think we can," John said.

"What makes you say that?" Pat asked.

"You yourself didn't just change," John explained. "You changed into something close to my girlfriend in college, and your family doesn't have red hair or green eyes in their gene pool. You changed because that's what I wanted you to change into."

"Then the changes aren't random," Pat whispered, understanding. "We could do it."

"Great!" said Phoebe, "Just tell me what to do. I'll go first."

"How about you tell me," Pat said assuming her teaching voice, as Danni and the others rolled their eyes. "We have been working on ideas related to this issue for weeks."

"We have?" asked Phoebe, confused.

"Yes," Pat repeated. "And last night's activities might help you figure it out."

"Sex?" asked Phoebe.

"Yes," said Pat gently, "but more than that. What's happened to our bodies, especially when we have sex."

"We make goop," Phoebe exclaimed.

"Right," said Pat, "and?"

"Each of our bodies are producing goop in our bodily fluids," Phoebe continued. "In fact, the ratio of active agent to non-reactive agents in our breast milk, semen, and female ejaculate is increasing, so that even our minor scraps and cuts heal nearly instantly. What used to take several hours to heal is now healed in minutes," she finished with a smile at Michael and Gail who had needed healing only a few days ago.

"Right," Pat responded. "So, how could we compress this slow build up of active agents in our bodies so that we can "control" or "force" the change, as Petra, Michael, and apparently John did?"

"I thought I would have become a woman anyway," Petra interrupted. "I only imagined what kind of woman I might become."

"You wouldn't have become a woman if you had a bigger body mass than John, or if we had sent you off alone with girls who were willing to let you remain a man," Pat corrected. "In fact, your transition was much quicker than mine or Danni's, in part, I think, because you were becoming a specific woman, not just a woman."

"So, in order to become that mermaid, we should ingest as much milk and other bodily fluids as we can stand, and then try to "will" the change," Phoebe said. "Wow ... that might actually work."

"Are you sure this is what you want?" asked Petra. "What if it doesn't work?"

"We are changing anyway," Phoebe pointed out, indicating her own webbing. "This way, at least I'll be doing something about it. I have to at least try. I don't want to be an ugly, flesh colored fish."

"I think we should all participate," Michael said.

"What, all of us trying to change right now?" Petra asked.

"No, I think that both our combined fluids and our combined focus and energy might give Phoebe a better chance of controlling the results," he answered. "When I was changing into Michael, I could feel the energy from Danni and Phoebe. I could sense how they wanted me to change, what they wanted me to change into, and all that energy and focus seemed to make it actually possible."

"Michael's right," Pat said. "And this, our Home Cave, our Moon Pool, is the perfect spot to try. We can all easily fit into this pool, and if it works, Phoebe can easily reach any passageway for easy access to most of the other rooms in this network of caves and pools. Besides, it's the only pool with good light, and it will help her concentrate on what she is doing to herself."

"So, what should we do?" asked Gail.

"Everyone in the pool, and we can breathe through our gills," Pat said. "Then we can start feeding Phoebe."

"Wait," Gail said. "Phoebe, there is something I want you to add."

"What?" she asked.

"As you imagine the mermaid you will become, think of a barb in your tail, something like a sting ray, so that we have a weapon of the water," Gail said.

"That's a great idea," Pat added. "As you focus on your beautiful tail, think about how strong it is, and think about how warm you will be, even in deep water, and focus your thoughts on a barb that you can use to paralyze attackers."

"You mean, make it non-lethal?" asked Phoebe.

"Paralysis is lethal if the attacker isn't rescued," Gail said with a grim smile.

"Makes sense," Phoebe said. "I wouldn't want to kill every time I used it."

"Are you ready," asked Pat. She nodded. "Right, then everyone look at this picture again, and hold it firmly in your minds. You did want the purple or golden color?"

"Blue," Phoebe said, glancing again at the pictures. "To match my eyes. Let's do it." And then she dove head first into the water and settled a few meters below the surface.

"That may be the last time she's able to do that," John mused.

"It could be the last time any of us can," Pat said as she dove in headfirst as well.

They all settled at the middle of the pool, the dim light cascading down from the chimney high above. Phoebe swam towards Pat.

"You're the mother of us all, the first to be changed, and so you will be first here," she said. "Give me my tail," she whispered as she attached herself to Pat's breast and sucked.

Pat felt the familiar stirrings of warmth, and fullness spread to her breasts. Phoebe was forcefully pulling milk from her breast, and after a few minutes, switched quickly to the other. When that one was dry, she moved to Gail.

"You are the mother to the second pod," she said. "Will you be my second?"

Gail nodded.

"Then give me my tail," Phoebe intoned as she latched onto her breasts. This was Gail's first time as a feeder, and she was surprised by the tender and powerful feelings that Phoebe's suckling evoked. Even so, she only produced a little milk, and Phoebe soon emptied her. She next swam to Petra.

"Here, Phoebe," Petra said, lifting her breasts in the water. "Show us how it's done."

Phoebe smiled and said, "My sister-uncle, give me my tail," as she fell onto one of Petra's enormous breasts. Petra drew a sharp breath and exhaled sharply, moaning into the pool. It was her first time as a feeder as well, and the physiological triggers were much different than mere sex play. She knew that her breasts were pumping a fluid into Phoebe that would transform her forever, and such a thought was intoxicating. She stroked Phoebe's hair as she suckled at her large breast, and she could feel the milk streaming from her large nipples.

"It's a good thing we have gills," remarked Pat. "Otherwise Petra would drown us with her milk."

Petra merely smiled through heavily lidded eyes at Pat as Phoebe continued her feeding. Meanwhile, Gail and Pat shared a quick look, and floated down below the circle, under Phoebe's gently twirling legs. Together they reached up and began rubbing them lengthwise, Gail on her back side, Pat at the front. Phoebe moaned into Petra's breasts as the other girls stimulated her skin, helping her focus her building energies onto her lower body. She fixed in her mind, the beautiful and strong mermaid, tireless swimmer, able to withstand deep ocean pressures and cold temperatures, and who had a hidden secret at where her tail and her fluke met, the junction before it fanned out. Petra's breasts were indeed generous, and Phoebe could feel the energy building in her. She switched to Petra's other breast, and found fresh vigor in those streams. When Petra's massive breasts finally gave out, Phoebe reached for Michael, who was already stiff watching this erotic dance in the water before him.

"You took my virginity," Phoebe half sang, as though in a trance, "Now, take from me my legs." She swallowed him to the hilt. Within seconds, he was spurting great ropes of cum down her throat. The combination of Michael's salty cum with the girls' sweet milk sent Phoebe's head spinning. Pat and Gail were still rubbing her legs, which now began to feel very warm, and her pelvis began to twitch internally. Phoebe redoubled her focus on her vision of the mermaid she wanted to become, and reached for John.

"Come, brother-husband," Phoebe sang with a languid, trance-like passion, "give me my tail."

John's cock was nearly vibrating with need from watching this incredible sight of Phoebe practically glowing in the pool before him. She pulled him into her mouth, and immediately he was cuming. He roared into the water as his torso twisted and pushed great spurts of cum into the eager Phoebe. When he was spent, Phoebe twisted gracefully in the water to face Danni. Her skin was glowing; they could all see it. Her blonde hair floated like a halo, her eyes shone with an inner light.

"Come, my first feeder, my sister-wife," Phoebe sang into the water, her eyes drooping heavily, her entire body quivering with passion and the effort to control the powerful forces that now surged through her body. Her legs were beginning to stiffen, her toes together, pointing at the bottom of the pool. She could feel Pat and Gail rubbing them lightly, up and down, up and down. "Come, my first, be my last, and give me my tail."

Danni floated forward as in a trance; the entire pool was charged with passion and power. When Phoebe attached herself to her breast, Danni swooned with the power of the moment. She orgasmed violently, feeling her breasts and vagina swell and shoot milk and cum into the water, but Phoebe held on to her with both control and tenderness, drinking deep from Danni's breast. Pat and Gail started humming, and soon Petra and the boys joined in. Deep within her chest, Danni felt a sound rise and vibrate past her lips into the water. Phoebe, delirious with passion, felt Danni's chest vibrate as she suckled milk from her nipple. The milk came in great spurts, like cum from the boys, matching Danni's still rippling orgasms. Her other breast, the one Phoebe was not attached to, simply spurted milk into the water.

When Danni stopped shaking, Phoebe pulled back ... moaning. She stretched her arms out horizontally, even with the surface, while her toes were stiffly pointed towards the bottom, suspended in the middle of the circle, surrounded by her pods who were humming a low tone into the water while the last of Danni's milk swirled in the water around Phoebe. Pat and Gail drifted back up to their places in the circle, and they all watched, and waited.

Phoebe appeared to be frozen in the water, her skin rippling with the energies she had consumed. Under the surface of her skin, she could feel great tremors of movement and muscles, energy and electricity running throughout her body. For her, time seemed to stop completely. Her eyes were open but sightless, focused on her vision of the beautiful, powerful, mermaid. Her mouth hung open in the water, her hands were out thrust in the light, while her rigid legs pointed directly to the bottom. She could feel the others around her, supporting her, loving her. Still, the great waves of movement rippled through her body.

To the others, Phoebe seemed suspended, frozen in the water. They knew time was passing, but they kept their vigil, kept humming, in the dim light from the sun as it slowly passed through the sky. After several hours, Phoebe moaned loudly into the water as a slow-motion twitch rolled through her body, and then she resumed her quivering rigidity. A few more hours passed before they could see that nearly imperceptible changes had begun to occur.

Internally, Phoebe felt no time pass. She had felt a great urge to push, and she moaned loudly into the water as she pushed with her diaphragm. As though in a dream-like slow motion, she felt her womb spasm with the most intense pleasure she had ever known, then her legs knit themselves together into a single unit, thousands of nerves, blood vessels, and cells pulling apart and pushing together, waves and waves pulsing through her legs and lower torso. The she felt her still pulsing womb slowly sink down a few inches as her vagina and other internal parts also moved forward and down. She could feel her gills tingling, her breasts up thrust in the water, her hair flowing down her back, and she could feel the presence of the others, helping, guiding, loving.

A moment seemed to pass where she was calm, and then she felt the need to push again. She pushed, and this time felt the bones of her legs break and fuse, merging into a new structure, longer and fuller than it had been before. That hurt, but the power of the goop made it pass quickly, and she could feel new muscles snaking from the bottom of her tail up through her pelvis to anchor themselves both there and along her ribs and back. They felt like strands of thread as they twisted their way up through her upper body, while below her hips, in her tail, the same muscle felt like thick rope as it throbbed and grew.

Another moment, and then she felt another tremor, and knew that her feet had disappeared while two enormous flukes pushed out from her, while two side fins pushed out from her mid-tail, and two more at her hips, each about seven inches long and four inches wide. The tremendous energy that had coursed through her body's core seemed to be pushing its way outward, making her skin tingle and twitch. Still, her body was rigid, vibrating with power, held in place by the forces she had marshaled to this task. Suddenly, a hot tremor flashed up through her torso and flowed out through her arms. Then another one bubbled up from her belly, crawling up through her chest, her neck, her face, and then out her skull and up through her floating hair. Another "moment" passed, and then she shuddered throughout her entire body, and arched her entire body backwards in a great release of ecstasy. Her tail came back above her head as she curled backwards, and suddenly she could see it, see her tail, floating a foot above her head. It was beautiful, an iridescent blue, matching her eyes, and her scales and flukes flickering with light. And then, she straightened, free from the grip of the transformation.

It was nearly as good as an orgasm.

It took nearly twenty-four hours before Phoebe finally relaxed in the water before them. The entire day and night had passed as they watched her amazing transformation. For the longest time she had hung frozen before them, not moving, not even seeming to breathe. Then, her legs had fused together, slowly, steadily, for several hours. As the hours passed, her lower body lengthened and gained the proportions of a mermaid's tail, just shy of five feet in length from her hips to her flukes, making her over seven feet long from head to flukes. As the early morning progressed, her "scales" appeared, starting at her waist and crawling slowly down over her hips and pelvic flippers, then down to her tailfin. Finally, her hands grew webbing, a small sharp fin appeared at her elbow, and her hair grew another foot.

Pat knew that whatever "work" the goop was doing, it was doing it far quicker than it had before. Perhaps their bodies were producing different or more powerful enzymes and antibodies that broke down existing tissue and helped the body rebuild itself quicker than it had occurred with herself and the others who had radically changed, like Danni, Petra, and Michael. Pat also noticed that she didn't feel tired, despite the nearly constant humming they all had been doing, and that she felt strangely peaceful as Phoebe floated languidly in the pool, still giving off a faint luminescence. She was sure that their own bodies were already internally altered to give them this kind of stamina and energy.

Pat couldn't think about science any longer, however, as she simply looked at the new Phoebe. She was the most beautiful creature Pat had ever seen, and it made her heart ache with eager desire to think that soon she would join her in transformation. It almost seemed magical, which made her even more determined to know how it was actually being done.

The entire group floated wordlessly in the water admiring Phoebe's incredible beauty, her long and powerful tail that seemed to flash and glow in the pool, her delicately matching webbing in her fingers and fins at her elbows, now the same iridescent bright, blue. Her tail actually had many colors shimmering across its surface, but the sum of all the parts was a brilliant, sea blue. Her eyes had also changed, becoming more jewel like, still bright blue, making them seem otherworldly, almost hypnotic, and her white blonde hair was now at least four feet long. Her torso seemed even more delicate and feminine perched atop her strong, yet beautifully decorated tail. Her fins and flukes were edged with a series of feathery wisps of white that matched her long flowing hair, and along her dorsal ridge which now extended mid-way up her back like a widow's peak, a similar mane of white membrane fluttered in the water. Her waist was still narrow and her rib cage slender; her breasts were unchanged, though the sheen of her skin was different. She was no longer human.

Phoebe herself could feel dramatic changes in her body, too many to enumerate. She could see much more clearly than before, and could "sense" the electrical charges each of her mates made, each one identifiable without her having to turn her head. She could sense the shape and outline of the pool, and the tunnel of water that twisted and turned to the sea. She could sense a bit of the cliff wall, where the tunnel emerged about ten meters below the surface. She could feel some of these things with new organs that must be in her tail or elsewhere, and some senses that were simply her gills, eyes, and nose working more clearly and sharply than before. Most of all, she could feel her tail, the water moving over each area of it. Her scales where not fish-like but were more like skin, smooth and joined, more like a dolphin's skin, and equally sensitive to touch. She could feel where her hair had brushed what used to be the top of her ass, but now was the top of her tail. She flexed her flukes, and they spread out below her like a Chinese fan, sending sparkles of color in every direction. She smiled at Pat, a dazzling smile of straight, white teeth, with surprisingly sharp and prominent eyeteeth.

"Looks like the mermaid is armed with more than a barb," Pat observed.

"Oh, right, that," said Phoebe with a silvery clarity, showing off her new vocal production that carried much more clearly in the water. She curled her tail forward, her pelvis still able to bend easily, while her lower tail flexed in every direction. She held her flukes open before her face, and where her flukes and tail joined, she spotted the dark spot where her barb lay hidden. There was a pleasant stiffness in the sheath-coiled spring that would snap forth at her command. It made her feel powerful.

"Phoebe, your voice?" Pat asked. "No air came out your mouth."

"No, none did," Phoebe said, observing again that no air did.

"How are you doing that?" asked Pat.

"Ever the scientist, eh Pat," joked John as he gave her a hug. "Why don't we leave Phoebe some space to figure everything out before we start in on her."

"How long did it take me to change?" asked Phoebe worriedly.

"About a day, more or less," answered Pat.

"No time for questions," Phoebe said urgently. "We don't have time."

"What do you mean, Phoebe?" Gail asked.

"I don't know, but I sense that we must continue, here, now," Phoebe sang in her silvery new voice. "We must all eat, and then begin again."

By now, everyone had learned to trust the instincts they were feeling, and everyone swam up to the surface to gather food, and Phoebe discovered that she had quite a bit of mobility on dry land. She could flex her flukes and both sets of pelvic and mid-tail fins and, using all six points to bear her weight, "salamander" across dry land with ease and speed. Her fins seemed to easily support her weight, but she needed at least one hand for speedy locomotion, and using two was almost as fast as running. Her pelvis also flexed in both directions now, which explained why it hadn't disappeared like in other sea mammals. She discovered, for example, that she could keep her upper torso vertical while rolling her tail horizontally across the floor.

After everyone had eaten, they returned to the pool, this time with Gail at the center.

"I couldn't produce much milk for Phoebe," Gail explained, "and so I want to be more of a partner for everyone. I think if I change next, I'll produce better milk."

"You produce the only milk I ever want," Petra said with a passionate kiss. "You are my sister-wife, and don't you forget it."

As Gail tried to hide her own discomfort with such affection, everyone arranged themselves around her in the pool. Gail felt compelled to follow a similar format as Phoebe, addressing each of the pod members, starting with Michael and ending with Petra, asking them for her tail. When she got to Phoebe, everyone could sense that Phoebe's milk was even more potent than their own fluids, and even Gail gasped with the effort of holding onto that power before she finished with Petra, whose generous breasts had already shown their bounty. Petra, like Danni with Phoebe, was locked into a cycle of orgasms as Gail drank from her breast last, her untended breast spurting into the water as Michael and John stroked Gail's legs, helping her focus.

Gail was finished by the next morning, at least two hours earlier than Phoebe had finished. As she floated before the astonished group, she twirled on her flukes to give everyone a good view.

Gail's long body was now nearly nine feet long (nearly three meters), and her tail was a midnight blue, shimmering with hints of purple and deep blues. With her white skin, jet back hair, smoldering violet jewel-like eyes, and mid-night black webbing on her fingers and fins at her elbows, she was stunning. Unlike Phoebe's delicate white membranes along the edges of her fins, flukes, and dorsal ridge, Gail's fins all sported sharp points, and the outer ends of her flukes terminated in a dangerous looking barbs. Her dorsal ridge was a soft, black velvet membrane, however, and like Phoebe's, it also fluttered gently in the water. Her paralyzing barb rested in the same spot as Phoebe's, and she too had sharp eyeteeth. Her nails also looked dangerous, while Phoebe's had merely looked dramatic.

"I want to be able to fight, and to use the cover of darkness to sneak up on enemies," she explained. "The barbs on my fins and flukes are not toxic," she continued, "But you don't want to wrestle with me," she finished, flexing her arms so that her elbow fins slashed through the water.

"I'm next," said Michael with a fierce look at his lover and mate.

Pat shuddered and arched herself backward, her iridescent sea-green tail vibrating above her head. Her body convulsed with the same orgasmic like release experienced by everyone else. Then, when she relaxed, she found herself floating within the most beautiful circle of fish and flesh, even with her now enhanced eyes, that she had ever seen.

In the bright moonlight, she could see Gail shining a rich midnight blue with her rich black highlights, while Michael was magnificent in shiny, obsidian black, his fins, flukes, and dorsal membrane tinged with a whisper of silver. Michael, now over ten feet long, also had a dorsal fin that he could raise or lower like a fan, rising out of what used to be his ass, matching the two pelvic fins that hung from where his hips had been. John had one too, and Pat had surmised that the dramatically stronger swimming ability the men had, might necessitate the additional stability a dorsal fin might provide. Finishing out Michael's pod was Petra, luminous in rich, dark lavender with forest green highlights on her fins, flukes, and membrane.

Of her own pod, Phoebe was still the stunningly bright sea-blue and white combination, while Danni was a rich yellow gold, her fins, flukes, and dorsal membrane a rainbow of colors, mostly a pale blue, flashing in the light. Danni's eyes also changed, adding a multihued sparkle of many colors to her previously light blue eyes. John, her precious John, was a dark, steel-grey with blue and black highlights shot throughout, while his fins, flukes, and dorsal ridge flashed in the water like silver.

Pat relaxed and looked down at herself, feeling her yet again dramatically changed body. Her sea-green tail was tinged with pink highlights along her fins, flukes, and membrane, the occasional pale blue spot here and there. She savored the water in the pool that had been warmed by the five days they had spent together and the transformations each of them had undergone. She could now feel everyone's electrical field, sense the water's surface above her, the pool's bottom below her, and the various tunnels the stretched out around her.

She noted as her tail shimmered in the moonlight, that her own transformation only took about 12 hours. Each transformed mermaid or merman had added to the increasing potency of their fluids, making them more and more powerful. She could see pinks and blues mixed in with the dominate pale greens, her hair had also lightened, becoming more red, off-setting her bright green eyes. She flexed her flukes, feeling the power and strength of her amazing tail, searching for and finding the pleasant coiled stiffness of her barb, hidden at the base of her tail.

They had done it. They were all changed.

"We need to rest and recharge," she said in her silvery new voice. Even as she spoke for the first time, she was cataloguing the sensations that told her that she had a new membrane in her throat that captured an air pocket around her vocal chords while she was underwater, allowing her to speak into her own head as an amplifier and resonator.

"We can just sleep here," Gail offered. "The pool is big enough, and the morning light will wake us."

"Besides," Michael added. "The last of our food is here, and we have enough for one more meal."

Together they all swam for the surface, and as the others had discovered after their transformations, Pat thrilled to the power and control her tail gave her. She gave quick flick of her tail and launched herself into the air, clearing the surface of the water, and sailed onto the smooth cave floor. She slid to where they had stacked the last of their dried fruit, nuts, and fish, and ate ravenously.

"Yea, it made me hungry too," said John, as he "salamandered" up to her. Pat gave him a quick kiss and then returned to her fish.

Finally, when they finished eating and were all feeling the strain of all the efforts they had expended, they thought about where to sleep.

"I think we will be more comfortable in the water," Phoebe said, having been a mermaid longer than anyone else. "But we should probably stay here as we can sense any intruder long before they reach us, whereas in the open sea, we might get surprised."

"You have been paying attention," Pat said, giving her sister-wife a chuck on her shoulder. "And all this time I thought all you wanted to do is play with dolphins."

"Now I can REALLY play with the dolphins," she said as she flipped backwards into the pool with a splash.

"We all can, now," Petra said as she slid more gracefully into the water.

"Shall we?" John asked with mock politeness.

"We shall," Pat said grinning as the two of them salamandered to the pool, and slipped headfirst into the water.

They found that their new bodies had a neutral buoyancy that allowed them to float about five meters below the surface with no effort, and that they floated tail down. John and his girls drifted to one side of the pool while Michael and his went to the opposite side.

At first, they all just floated near one another, but one by one, each girl wrapped herself around John or Michael. Pat was first, leaning her head under John's chin, and resting her palm on his broad chest. She twisted her tail around his, laying her flukes on the back of his still broad tail, nearly two feet above his one flukes. Then Danni snuggled onto John's left shoulder, her tail entwined with his and Pat's, and finally Phoebe snuggled on to his right shoulder, her tail lying over the top of everyone else's.

John cocked an eye open and saw Gail and Petra similarly wrapped around Michael. He thought he could see them moving against one another, when he felt a twinge in his tail. No ... it couldn't be ... after five straight days awake, humming and feeding and changing?

When John had finished his transformation, he knew that he still had a cock, and that it had grown yet again. Michael's modest cock as a man had grown to nearly a foot long as a merman. When John gave Pat her last feeding, before she transformed (his first as a merman), he had discovered that he had to perform a quick tug on a new muscle to open a vent in his tail >from which his penis emerged. That first time he had nearly doubled over in pain because he didn't open the vent until the last possible minute, and his rising cock had begun to hurt, trapped as it was inside him. His new cock was nearly 14 inches long, throbbing and pulsing. Pat had only been able to take a few inches into her mouth, but that was enough. When he came, mere seconds later, the orgasm seemed to start deep in his tail, and he could feel his semen rising from at least half way down. The increased distance had translated into increased pleasure, as far as he could tell, and a dramatically increased volume. He had enjoyed the feelings of stiffness that extended a good foot down into his tail, the throbbing blood engorged roots of his new penis.

Now, with these three beautiful sister-wives all lovingly attached to him, with their flukes all stroking his tail just below where his testes probably were now lodged, he could feel the blood flow to his long and thick penis. It didn't help when he felt Pat's hand curl into a rake and begin to stroke his chest. He knew they should rest, but he couldn't help himself. He opened his vent before it became painful.

Pat was enjoying the warmth of her husband-lover, feeling his heartbeat with her cheek and hand, and the warmth of their entwined tails sliding against one another's. She loved the feelings of Danni's and Phoebe's breasts as they brushed her elbow fins or pushed up against her own bulging breasts she was trying to grind into John's chest. She recognized the signs of arousal quickly, having watched each new transformed mermaid become aroused as the next transformee fed from her breasts. Like the others had during the various transformations, Pat's own breasts had visually swelled, filling with milk, pressing more firmly into John's chest, while her now hidden lips within her tail swelled with blood, forcing a small opening to appear in her tail just below her pelvis. Her gills stiffened, gathering oxygen in preparation for the efforts of making love, which added to the sexual tension she was feeling. She knew without looking that her flukes had spread out, like a peacock's tail, and were now quivering with sexual need. The first time she saw Phoebe's tail quiver while she was feeding Gail, she wanted to know what that felt like.

Now she did.

She gently curled her fingers and raked John's beautiful chest with her sharp nails. Ah ... that did trick, she thought. John opened his vent, and his cock poked her in the tail. It felt hot, warmer than anything else she was pressing against. Before he could protest, and using the combined anchors of her sister-wives tail's surrounding her own, she maneuvered herself in front of his cock, and slowly eased it into her now transformed vagina.

She had to stifle a moan, as she didn't want to attract attention from Michael' pod, but she need not have worried. If she had looked, she would have seen that Gail had already beaten her by a half second. She raised her head and gazed into John's steel grey eyes, flecked with flashes of silver, and kept up the steady pressure that was putting inch after inch of his cock into her. She felt Danni and Phoebe's hands stroke her sides, fins, and breasts, and she turned to see each of them smiling at her with love.

Pat felt John's cock begin to vibrate and saw that Danni's eyes had also widened with surprise, then lidded over with pleasure as she softly moaned. Pat turned and watched as Phoebe did the same thing, and then looked down to where her own body had nearly swallowed John's enormous and now vibrating cock. Because there was still about two inches to go, she could see that John's pelvic fins were fluttering, vibrating as his cock was inside her, but that the tip of his fins were now pressed to the girl's vents, and were rubbing their clits.

"I'm not doing that on purpose," John whispered in awe.

"I'm not complaining," whispered Pat as she pushed hard against him and buried the last two inches inside her. Both girls on either side nodded in wordless agreement, too overcome with lust to speak.

The moment their genitals made contact, Pat could feel her newly positioned clit vibrate with pleasure, and she knew why Danni and Phoebe were having nearly as good a time as she was. Still, she was the one with John's penis buried deep within body, and so she began to move her velvet grip back and forth along his great length. All four of their flukes were now vibrating, casting shimmering reflections of moonlight all around them. The gentle motions of their tails combined with the fluttering dorsal membranes caused their tangled, tower of passion to twirl slowly in the water.

Pat was dimly aware of Petra, Gail, and Michael locked in a similar embrace, and once or twice she saw them when the gentle spinning caused by their entwined, vibrating tails brought the other group into her field of vision. She could also sense their altered electrical fields, and that added to the incredible feelings of sensuality she was experiencing. She kept up her gentle stroking, feeling the great bulbous head of John's cock reach nearly to her diaphragm, filling her completely, stretching her. As her passion built, her strokes became shorter, more urgent. On her left, Danni gripped her arm with one hand and John's shoulder with the other has she pressed her sex onto John's vibrating fin. Danni's bright eyes were shinning with love when they rolled suddenly in her head, and a great orgasm tore through her body. Her breasts spurted milk into the water as her entire tail quivered and shook. Phoebe joined her quickly, her breasts spurting milk as she squealed in passion, her tail compressing over Pat's and Danni's onto John's.

"I love you," Pat whispered to all three of them. Her pelvis was now slamming only the last two inches of John's cock in and out, pounding with increasing need against his body, pushing her aching clit against the ridges at the top of John's vent. Pat reached both arms around her lover, and ground her sex against his, feeling his massive penis as it rotated deep within her, and then the floodgates opened.

With her tail for leverage, she leaned her upper body backwards, pressing her pelvis to his, while her breasts released her milk into the water in great streams, showering all of them in a white cloud that formed around all four of them. Her womb clamped down on John's cock, bringing him to his orgasm, and she could feel the great spurts of cum as they rose from mid-way up his tail, pulsing just below the surface of his scales where their two tails were pressed together, rising up through his long cock, and erupting deep inside her. Her orgasm rippled through her anew with each pulse from John's cock, and both Phoebe and Danni erupted in second orgasms of their own. Again, and again, Pat's torso jerked and trembled as her new "mermaid's" womb clenched in pure ecstasy.

Just before she fell asleep, with John's slowly softening cock lodged inside her, she happily noted that a mist of white also obscured the other pod from view.

### 05 - The Rescue


Gail wanted to cut off her hair.

"It will make me faster," she complained. "I want to be as fast and as strong as possible."

"Don't," pleaded Petra.

"Just do it," Gail asked. "Please," as she held out the shears for her sister-wife.

They were sitting, mermaid style with their flukes in the water in the Moon Pool cave where the dim light from the stormy sky above filtered down. Michael and John were out searching for useful tools among the reefs, cliffs, and along the drop off where shipwrecks from time immemorial, but mostly from WWII, could be found. The men could swim almost twice as fast and as deep as the women, and they seemed to really enjoy going out together, pushing their new bodies to the limits of endurance and depth. It rankled Gail that her own pod-mate/exsister could go faster, deeper, and longer than she could.

"I can't," Petra pleaded.

"Why not?" demanded Gail.

"Because I love you," Petra said, stroking Gail's cheek.

"You love me," she asked, disbelieving, "and THAT is a reason not to cut my hair." At that moment, Pat popped up from the pool, twirling as she rose from the water, smoothly and powerfully rising on her sparkling sea-green tail, and settling next to Gail with a large net of freshly paralyzed fish, mostly tuna.

"When I think about doing it," Petra said holding Gail's beautiful face in her hands, "I get a terrible, wrenching feeling in my gut. I don't know why."

"Why would cutting my hair make you feel that way," asked Gail.

"Because cutting our hair is a bad idea," Pat said. "Phoebe and I have been doing some tests, and our hair is different from normal human hair," she continued, holding a lock of her own hair towards Gail. "Look closely and you can see micronodules that form the sheath of each hair strand. Those same structures are in our skin and scales. These tiny structures force the water to ball up whenever we emerge from the water. You've noticed how water sluices off us when we get out of the water?"

Gail nodded, noting how quickly Pat had dried off, and her hair appeared to be nearly dry even though she had only just emerged from the water.

"It's one reason why we don't feel dirty," Pat continued. "In Biology, it's called the Lotus effect; surface structures force water into little balls, rather than beading or sloughing down our skin, and those balls actually clean our skin and scales each time we dry off because a ball of water picks up dust, dirt, flaking skin cells, etc., whereas a drip of water just slides across the skin, leaving dust, dirt, and even a bit of water on the surface."

"Is that why we swim so fast and so easily?" asked Petra.

"Not fast enough," Gail complained.

"Yes, my dear," Pat chided. "Michael and John will always be faster than us; they are bigger by nearly two feet. But you're right, Petra, we are a lot faster than I would expect for aquatic mammals of our size and strength. And, miss grump," she concluded, addressing Gail directly, "the length of our hair shields our gills from sunlight while we are swimming."

"Our gills can be harmed by sunlight?" asked Gail. "What about the men? Their hair isn't nearly as long as ours."

"Our gills are built slightly differently," Pat explained, turning Petra around so she and Gail could examine her back together. Pat swung her long tail onto the cave floor behind her, easily holding her torso vertical despite the reversed angle. Pat felt her pelvic bones shift, a reminder of her newly reorganized system of bones and muscles. It felt like sitting up, except that her back muscles worked at holding her upper torso upright rather than her abdominal wall. If the results would not be so catastrophic, she would love to dissect someone to see how it all worked. Instead, she gently ran her fingers down Petra's mane of hair, separating the dark, lush brown hair into two strands that she pushed forward over Petra's soft, sloping, shoulders.

"See how the inside edge of each gill is lighter ... pinker ... and that there is a different texture and organization of those tubular gill filaments that run down the entire length," she asked as she ran her fingers lightly down Petra's spine.

"Hey, now," Petra giggled. "You keep that up and I will throw you down and ravish your body."

"Although that might be fun," Pat said, noting how Gail stiffened at Petra's tease, "I will wait for my own sister-wives to return from fishing. Now, pay attention. This interior edge is much more sensitive to UV radiation, and I think that it would be very painful if it got too dried out or even worse, sun burnt. It might even kill us; I'm not sure. So I don't think we should actually test it, but Phoebe's hair blocks less light than ours, and she gets irritated along that interior ridge if she spends too much time on or near the surface, swimming with her back to the sky."

"And the men?" Gail asked.

"Their pink filaments are centered near the top of their gills, and their shorter hair covers that dense patch just fine," Pat explained. "I think because their shoulders are so much broader, they have more room at the top of their gills. Our shoulders are comparatively narrow, and so our pink filaments run the length of our gills."

Gail thought about what Pat had said. The men did have long hair, but it only reached to the top of their dorsal ridge, about mid-way down their backs, leaving the bottom halves of their gills fully exposed. The girls, however, had hair that reached down over the entire length of their gills, two strips of red, tender skin that lifted filaments into the water whenever they were submerged for more than a minute or two. Their gills followed their spines, about three inches wide at the top on the men, and only about an inch wide for the women. Both men and women had darker sections of filaments that followed their spine down, narrowing to a mere sliver at the bottom of their waists where their scales met their skin. A prominent dorsal ridge climbed up from their hips like a reverse widow's peak, terminating in the middle of their backs, a slight ridge that allowed them to lean back onto surfaces without putting direct pressure on their sensitive gills.

"Finally, I would bet that the microstructures in our hair actually add to our speed," Pat argued. "It breaks the surface tension of the water molecules as we move through the water, and so cutting it off might make you slower."

"But if our skin and hair is hydro, hydro ..." Petra struggled.

"Hydrophobic," Pat filled in.

"Hydrophobic," Petra continued with a smile. "Why do we float below the surface rather than on top, like Lotus plants?"

"I think it is because our new tails are so dense," Pat answered. "If you try to lift someone else's tail with your hands, you'll find that they are incredibly heavy, which is why we float tail down. Our upper bodies are much less dense ..."

"And much less strong," Gail interrupted.

"But strong enough," Pat continued gently. "Without tests I am unwilling to undertake ... "

"What tests," Petra asked.

"Dissection," Pat answered.

"Oh, right," Petra said. "Good idea not to do one of those."

"Yes," Pat agreed. "I can't tell you more about what goes on inside our new bodies."

"I keep forgetting that you were a scientist," Petra said.

"AM a scientist! Why do you forget?" Pat asked warily.

"Because you're so pretty," Petra giggled.

"Why do we have such different gills?" Gail asked, interrupting Petra's flirting.

"I don't know yet, but most species have subtle differences between the male and female species in several body systems," Pat said thoughtfully. "Our torsos are smaller, and so our gills are smaller, so perhaps the pink bits are what absorb oxygen while the darker bits are where we slough off carbon dioxide."

"We have breasts, too, you know," Petra teased, swinging hers against Gail's other arm.

"YOU have breasts," Pat said with a smile. "The rest of us just have chests."

"I'm just frustrated," Gail grumped, nevertheless enjoying Petra's attention, feeling her enormous breasts rubbing against her elbow fin. "I want to free our island of that scum."

"I know," Pat said gently. "And you are the strongest mermaid here, which is saying something. I'm going to find Danni and Phoebe and help them with the fishing. Why don't you two mind the Listening room," she said as she lifted herself up onto her fins and flukes and wiggled to the edge of the pool and slipped head first into the water.

"Come on," Petra said as she watched Pat's flashing sea-green tail disappear down the tunnel, "Michael will be back soon, and then we will start making our plans for the rescue."

Gail gazed into Petra's rich, hazel-green eyes, not a bright green, like Pat's, but softer, flecked with gold. Sometimes her heart felt small and hard, and Gail wished she could feel the emotional and sexual freedom that Michael and Petra seemed to share with each other. When Petra leaned in to kiss her, she could feel herself tense up, pull back. Petra persisted, however, knowing and loving her pod-mate. She opened her lips to the kiss, willing her cool and distant pod-mate to feel the great depth of love she felt for the incredibly beautiful Gail. She opened her eyes in the kiss, gazing at Gail's violet eyes, sparkling in the light of the overcast sky that cascaded down into the moon pool.

Slowly, Gail softened into Petra's warm and welcoming kiss, nibbling at her full lips as they caressed her own. She felt the familiar tightening across her breasts as she responded to Petra's amorous advances. In between, kisses, she said, "We should continue this, in the listening room."

Petra pulled Gail into a fierce hug, not breaking her kiss, and then pulled them both into the pool with a flick of her tail. Not releasing her hug, Petra slowly propelled them both down the tunnel to the Listening Room, sensing the twists and turns of the underwater tunnel with her mermaid "sight," a combination of sensitivity to electrical impulses in all living things, like the organisms living on the rocks along the tunnel walls, and a sonar of sorts that used the reflection of the ambient sounds of their own swimming to form a dim picture of their surroundings in the darkness of the tunnel.

Gail didn't know why Petra could do this to her, but she allowed herself to be swum to the Listening Room. She could feel Petra's enormous breasts pushing against her own as they swam together, their tails crossing and caressing as Petra's long gentle strokes propelled them forward. They rose to the surface of the pitch black "Listening Room," and floated in the water with their heads breaking the surface. Petra was still kissing her, even as Gail began to sort out the sounds as they echoed down the various cracks in the earth into this small room. Their enhanced audio processing also allowed them to "hear" the sounds from many different parts of the island with great clarity. This morning, however, the island was being pelted with a rain, and no useful sounds of Alberto and his men could be heard. In some ways, this was a good thing; no screams from one of the five young captives would likely interrupt what Petra had planned for Gail.

Petra had become more and more attached to her pod-mates, especially since their dramatic transformations into living and breathing mermaids and mermen. When she gazed at Michael's long, broad tail, his chiseled face, his muscled back, his hair and face glistening with water, or at Gail's sleek lines, her dramatic coloring, her soft curves, or the fire that burned in her eyes, it made Petra's womb ache, but it also made her soul ache. These two had suffered so much, and yet they had focused their new lives on their two pods and on rescuing the captives. They pushed their bodies harder; volunteered long hours of keeping watch, depriving themselves of sleep and rest, and Petra admired them intensely. She knew that Michael had found some healing in his new sex, in her love for him, and in their lovemaking that was free, frantic, and frequent. Gail was more difficult. She could not let go, could not return the affection Petra so very much wanted to give her. She had to find a way.

As the two mermaids kissed in the dark pool, both of their tails began to glow, giving off a biochemical luminescence that slowly filled the pitch-black room with a soft light. Gail's tail glowed a rich lavender that shimmered up and down her tail, rippling up from her flukes and flashing along her flanks, while the green highlights along her dorsal ridge and fins also flashed in the dark water. Gail's tail was a barely visible, deep, dark blue ripple of light that only seemed visible in the reflection of Petra's luminescence. The black highlights on her dorsal membrane and fins and flukes flashed the faintest traces of pale, white light as she became more and more aroused. Making love in one of the many dark pools of water within these caves had become something of an adventure for the new water dwellers, thrilling to the symphony of color by which their own bodies produced light under these circumstances.

"Gail, my sister-wife," Petra moaned, "you are the most beautiful creature I've ever seen," she said as she sucked on Gail's sensitive, swan-white neck. "I want to touch you, love you, caress you forever."

"How can you say those things," Gail pleaded, "What about Michael?" She tried to push away, but Petra wrapped her tail around hers three times, and held her firm to her ample bosom.

"Now listen here, woman," Petra started. "Well, not merely a woman any more. You goddess of the water! I love you both! Don't you get it? We are pod-mates."

"But I am hard and cold," Gail argued. "And you are soft and warm."

"Which makes us a great pair," Petra said as she kissed Gail's strongfeatured face. "Why can't you believe that I love you?"

"Because, you are the one who is beautiful, so sexy, so easy with Michael," Gail said with a sob. "I'm hard, calculating, and cold."

"I'll show you how cold you are," Petra said firmly. "Sink."

"We can't, we have to listen," Gail worried.

"There's a storm," Petra told her, "we can't hear anything, and won't be able to for hours. Sink."

"Can't," whispered Gail.

"Can," whispered Petra as she nuzzled her pod-mate's neck, and let herself go limp, using her own body weight to pull Gail under the water. They sank about ten meters, and hung in the water, locked in their embrace. They could see each other clearly, both because of their enhanced vision and because of the glow they now gave off.

Petra released her lover and then slowly began swimming around and around her, caressing Gail's body with her own breasts, her hands, and her tail. She grazed Gail's back, gills, tail, breasts, gliding past lips, eyes, arms, and fins.

"Feel how silky your hair is," she whispered as she gathered Gail's sleek black hair in her hand and held the hair to her own breasts as she twirled around her. "Your dorsal membrane is so soft, like Spanish black lace. I can put my arm around your waist and reach my own breast."

"That's because you have incredible breasts," moaned Gail, feeling the effects of Petra's constant fondling of her entire body.

"Your flukes are supple yet strong, and so rich with color and light," Petra continued as she chased the flashes of light that sparkled from within Gail's now quivering tail, spread wide in evidence of her mounting sexual tension. "I love the way your fins soften in my hands, and the way your waist meets your tail, so curvy and soft." Gail gasped with passion as Petra's feather-light touches ignited her body.

Petra rose before Gail, her own breasts swollen with passion, their impressive size now floating conically, her large nipples stiff and erect in the dim light, her dorsal membrane fluttering and flickering madly with soft, green and lavender light. Her own flukes were also fully spread, quivering in the dark water, shooting tendrils of lavender light up her flanks as she hung in the water.

"Drink from me, my love," Petra asked, as she fluttered her tail to lift her swelling breast to Gail's lips. "Take comfort from me, take from me ... peace."

Petra pulled Gail's lips to her breast, and then stroked Gail's beautiful black hair as she began to suckle. Gail slowly, gently wrapped her tail around her lover's, resting her hands on Petra's slim waist, stroking the line that separated her tail from her waist. Petra focused her thoughts on love, peace, and comfort as Gail's suckling slowly built passion and effort. Soon, milk was pouring from her breasts, and Gail was pulling and sucking with passion on Petra's impressive bounty. As she drank from Petra's breasts, Gail's tail increased its luminescence, the flashes of light building in frequency and intensity. Her own breasts swelled with passion, and her mind began to relax.

Petra sank back down into a kiss, pressing her breasts against Gail's, kissing her with passion and hunger. She wrapped her tail around hers again, and used that advantage to press her genital vent against Gail's, creating a pocket of suction. Her pelvic fins beat against Gail's, increasing the vibrations of their union, and further elevating Gail's building passion.

"Give yourself to me," Petra whispered. "Cum for me."

Gail reached behind her sister-wife and grabbed the generous bones of her pelvis, her wide hipbones that now bent in both directions. She pulled Petra to her fiercely, further entwining their tails together, pressing their bodies together. Petra happily purred, grinding her hips against Gail's, pressing their breasts together, kissing her neck and ears, cheeks and chin.

"Oh, Petra," Gail groaned, "my sister-wife."

Their bodies were now twisting quickly in the darkened pool, locked in a passionate embrace, their hips grinding together as their breasts and lips danced in the cool, dark water, their tails both pulsing with electricity. Petra began whimpering, "please, please ... please ... oh ... please" as her own orgasm built, but she refused to give in, focusing her energy on bringing release and pleasure to her partner. She reached behind her sister-mate and stroked Gail's gills lightly with her fingers. Gail's body responded, immediately, involuntarily, responsively to Petra's stimulation, and her abdomen began to pulse against the voluptuous Petra.

"Oh ... my ... goooooooooooo" Gail dissolved into incoherence as a massive orgasm overtook her. Her eyes rolled back in her head as she bit down into Petra's shoulder. She felt her tail quiver and shake more violently, her clitoris vibrating against her lover's, their bodies pressed together.

Petra felt a sharp, sweet pain as Gail's eye teeth sank into her shoulder, but felt at the same moment her own milk flowing through her veins, nurturing them both, healing her of Gail's love bite.

"Yes, take me ... bite me ... love me," Petra whispered to her convulsing lover. "My love can heal your pain." Gail lifted from Petra's shoulder, her eyes sightless and unconscious of how her own pent up passion had exploded into her lover's flesh leaving four neat puncture wounds that closed as quickly as her teeth had released their grip. Gail merely continued to shake into her lover, pulsing with abandon, rather than control.

As she watched Gail thrash out her first real orgasm, Petra allowed her own release to come, joining with her as both their breasts spurted their milk into the water around them. Soon they were both lost in a haze of pleasure, release, healing, and white milk.

Mai Lin wanted to die.

She had been captive now for many months, and she had lost track of time. She no longer cared when Alberto's men came into her hut and took their pleasure; her body no longer felt any pleasure at all. Sometimes, she felt more dead than alive. In fact, if it hadn't been for Martin, one of the Henderson triplets, she might have died three weeks ago. Dear, sweet Martin ... only 17, but so wise. He had simply held her hand through the night as she miscarried, the sorry result of her near constant abuse by Alberto's men, never saying anything, giving her warmth and support, and helping her staunch the bleeding. She knew that he was being raped too, but he never complained, never flinched. She could see the quiet courage behind his eyes, and something else too. She wasn't sure. Neither his sisters nor Shou Ling, the other Chinese captive, had been able to help her that night, lost as they were to their own hellish nightmares that stalked all of their dreams. She vowed she would not forget Martin's kindness and quiet courage.

She had been captured, along with several other Chinese passengers including Shou Ling, when she went on a pleasure cruise with friends from her boarding school in Hong Kong. The other girls had died months ago; the three crewmembers of the charter boat were killed when Alberto's men boarded their boat. Somehow, both she and Shou Ling had survived. They were both Han Chinese, from northern China, and were relatively tall for Chinese women, about 5' 7'' and pretty. Shou Ling seemed to have a bit less of a wild streak in her because she seemed aloof to what her captors were doing, whereas Mai Lin fought it every step of the way, trying to force this nightmare to end. After they had beaten her or raped her yet again, she would close her eyes, and wait for death to come, but instead a new morning greeted her yet again. Which was just fine with her; she would have yet another opportunity for revenge.

Mai Lin had been a young master in shaolin kungfu, which was probably the only reason she was still alive. She could deflect the blows that might have killed her without seeming to, and her captors seemed to enjoy beating the beautiful young woman. She kept her secrets to herself, and bided her time, waiting for Alberto to do something foolish so she could kill him. After she had blinded one man who was foolish enough to rape her by himself, without someone else to hold her down, they had nearly killed her. But she was beautiful, and Alberto forbade them from killing her, though she did get a pretty severe beating. Mai Lin had learned to walk the thin line between compliance and resistance, looking for her opportunities for revenge, but keeping her captors happy.

She looked across the sand in the early morning light, the sky still a vibrant blue as the sun had yet to peak over the horizon of calm water and placid palm trees, and look back inside the hut to took stock of her fellow captives. The Henderson's were all curled in a corner, a tangle of limbs as much for protection as for warmth, the triplets now united in a race for survival. Shou Ling was propped against the wall, beaten and bruised because she would not respond last night to the men's request that she dance. Mai Lin admired her courage, even if it was misplaced-it would have been so easy to give them a little dance-and wondered how a girl so beautiful, more beautiful than she herself was, could have so much stubborn fire in her soul. She wished she could have taken Shou Ling's beating, she could have withstood it more easily, and looking across at her fellow countrywoman, she feared that Shou Ling would not survive many more such beatings.

She glanced again at the three sleeping Henderson's, feeling a great wave of affection wash over her. They had been so scared when they were first added to Alberto's menagerie of captives, but even in their fear they had reached out to Mai Lin, who spoke only broken English at best. In order to keep their spirits up, the Henderson's had taken to helping Mai Lin with her English, Shou Ling didn't need much help, as her English was fine. But after Rikki and Cleo, the identical twin sisters, were gang raped one night by the all of Alberto's men, they both had stopped talking to anyone and now seemed to be walking through life as in a trance. Martin still showed signs of life and fight, but there were deeper waters in his eyes than she could figure out. Only a few of Alberto's men had an interest in his body, and the two women seemed to be lovers themselves. Everyone, however, even the two women gang members, loved the Henderson girls; Mai Lin worried that the twins would soon simply expire and that Alberto would kill Shou Ling because she was so stubborn. That would leave only her and the boy, Martin, to satisfy the selfish desires of Alberto's men. She shuddered at the thought.

A flash of blue caught her eye in the lagoon as she turned back to the water, trying to will herself erect so that she could make another attempt at escape. She thought she could see a tail fin of a large fish, nearly ten feet in length, as the flukes, over three feet across, arched back into the sea. She brought a shaky hand back up to her eyes to rub them, disbelieving what she had seen, and tried to stare out into the early morning light to catch another glimpse of that beautiful fish, blue scales with the hint of white along the dorsal ridge. Suddenly she saw a flash of gold tinged in a multi-hued blue crest the surface not three meters where she had seen the first fish tail break the smooth surface of the water. The beautiful flukes flashed in the pale light of the morning sun that had finally crested over the horizon to her left.

Then she thought she saw a face ... a human face ... a beautiful girl, lift her head from the water closer to shore. She had blonde hair that was nearly white, and beautiful blue eyes. She was only about twenty meters from shore, in about two meters of water. Then, a second face emerged, also a blonde female, with golden hair but equally blue eyes, or so it seemed to Mai Lin. The pair of beautiful women stared at the camp for a minute or two, Mai Lin barely breathing, not daring to raise the alarm. Suddenly, one of the beautiful girls caught Mai Lin's eyes, and smiled, and put a finger to her lips for silence. Mai Lin's widened in surprise ... she had been seen, and these girls knew she was a captive!

Suddenly there was a shout from another hut, and the two girls ducked under the water and disappeared. Mai Lin stared hard at the spot where they had appeared, but she could see no other sign of them. She searched the water for any sign of swimmers or of the large fish she had seen earlier, but she could only see the calm, early morning waters of the lagoon where they had been held captive for so many weeks.

A few seconds later, a group of five or six men had gathered at the beach, all searching the water, shouting at one another in a mixture of Pilipino, Spanish, and English. Mai Lin could make out some of their English, and they seemed to be shouting about a sea monster. Alberto himself came down to the beach and demanded which of them had seen the sea monster. One of the men stepped forward and described a great fish of gold with terrible teeth, and Alberto shot him. He then pointed his gun at the others and reminded them that they were on the lookout for people, for the police, not sea monsters.

A glance back to the hut confirmed that the gunshot had woken up his captives. He decided that it was time for some morning fun.

"All five are still alive," Phoebe reported, "and we waited until we were seen before we ducked under the water."

"I think one of the Chinese girls may have seen us," Danni said. "I mean she really "saw us;" she looked really shocked when I smiled at her."

"That doesn't mean that she saw your tail," Gail said. "If I had seen anyone who was not connected to my captors who actually "saw me," I would have been surprised too."

"I guess you're right," Danni agreed. "In any case, if we are successful with our rescue, it won't matter. They will know who we are."

"There will be another storm tonight; are we ready?" asked Pat, looking around the Moon Pool at the collected pods. Everyone nodded in agreement.

"One more time," Gail said. "I hate to be a hard ass but it's ... "

"... because you love us," Petra said, reaching out to her sister-wife and stroking her arm fins.

"Yea," Gail said, softly, "it is."

Everyone had noticed the change in Gail over the last two weeks as their plans for mounting a rescue came together. She seemed more connected, more balanced, and less angry. She and Petra had spent much more time together, and Michael had now been forced to step up his amatory efforts (he was most eager and willing to do so). Petra had always been randy and ready, demanding attention from Michael several times a day, but Gail had only allowed herself to be taken by him occasionally. In the last two weeks, however, she had made love to him every day, and, in the last few days, joined Petra for a second or even a third round of sex. She still had the fierce gleam in her eyes, and no one doubted her dedication to pay back with double interest the suffering she had endured at Alberto's hands.

"Right," Michael said watching with grateful pride and love as his wives softly stroked one another. "John and I will take the old mines we found and release them under the boats. If either one still works, that will signal the rest of you to begin."

"Are you sure you will have enough time to get clear?" asked Petra for the hundredth time.

"The mines are counter weighted, and it will take them at least a minute to travel the fifteen meters up from the bottom to hit the boats," Pat reassured her, yet again. "They can swim faster than any of us, and should be clear by at least double the distance needed. Do you think I'd let John do anything that crazy?"

"And everyone remember to protect your ears," Phoebe added.

"If the mines don't go off," John continued. "We will climb on board and sabotage the engines, and then use the bow gun on the larger boat to sink both boats."

"Because the mines will work," Danni said with a smile and a caress for her pod-mate, "John and Michael will rush over to us when the blast goes off. Petra and I will start shouting for help from the west side of the lagoon, making sure our human half is clearly visible, while the boys lurk below to make sure no trouble gets too close."

"As soon as enough men are drawn to the beach, trying to save their boats or these two bathing beauties, we three will make for the prisoner's hut from our hiding place on the east side of the lagoon," Phoebe reported. "Gail in the lead, then me, then Pat."

"I'll take out the guard, if he remains, and then use my coloring to hide and wait for anyone who may head in our direction," Gail said firmly.

"Phoebe and I will enter the hut, rouse the prisoners, use our canteens that are full, thanks to Petra, give them a stiff dose of milk, and lead them to one of the two inflatable dinghies on the beach," Pat said. "We will use our barbs to puncture one, and load the prisoners onto the other. Once the boat clears the beach, we will swim with the boat towards the open sea."

"John, Michael, Petra, and Danni will continue to provide a distraction, while I join the girls behind the dingy," Gail said. "Once we clear the lagoon, everyone will help get the dinghy back the western cliffs as quickly as possible."

"Then, we will take them into the water, and rush them through the tunnels back here," Pat finished, "forming a fireman's brigade to help them breath by giving them our air until they reach the Moon Pool Cave."

They all looked again at each other, nodded and headed down the tunnel to the open sea.

It was a very loud explosion.

Martin struggled towards consciousness, the lethargy that gripped his body would not release him, and he struggled against the nightmare that held him. He heard someone calling his name, and he opened his eyes. There was a beautiful woman urging him to wake up, to rise. Her red hair was curled around her neck and shoulders like a velvet scarf, her green eyes shone even in the dark, storm tossed hut, but she didn't look wet. How could that be; it was raining. She was naked, too.

That got his attention, and weakened as he was, he struggled to sit up.

"Here, drink this," the vision of beauty ordered. He did so, and was immediately rewarded with a feeling of warmth and vitality that coursed through his throat like a fine whiskey, burning slightly but warming him. He could see another figure in the hut, moving very strangely, who's hair seemed nearly white. Then he saw the sparkling sea-blue of her tail ... her long tail ... her mermaid's tail that looked just like the pictures from his long missing diary.

"Whu, wha, what is ... " he sputtered.

"No time for questions now," the redhead whispered tensely, "follow us down to the dinghy. We are trying to rescue you."

He struggled to his feet and looked for his sisters. He saw that they were already outside, waiting for him. Shou Ling was helping Mai Lin stumble through the rain, running for the beach. He tried to ignore the strange gait of his rescuers as they slithered over the sand, but they moved much more quickly than he did. He became aware that the boats in the lagoon were burning, and that a group of Alberto's men were running along the western arm of the lagoon shouting. He nearly tripped over a gang member who was inert on the sand, a neat red hole in the middle of his stomach.

The white haired mermaid (mermaid!) was falling back, trying to urge him to go faster. He tried to get his feet to obey his commands, but it was like he was still in the dream. Everything seemed to go in slow motion. Finally, the dinghy appeared before him, and he tumbled into the small boat, laying against his sisters who were also heaving with the effort of the short dash for freedom. The boat lurched towards the sea, and then slowly gathered speed as it headed for the middle of the lagoon.

Gunshots rang out, and Martin chanced a look over the edge of the inflatable dinghy. Illuminated by the light of the burning boats which he was now passing on his right, he could see some men scrambling on the beach, firing shots at their boat. Bullets zipped into the water and one pinged off the outboard engine, but none hit the vulnerable craft. The boat seemed to be picking up speed, but he couldn't hear an engine running nor could he feel the vibrations of one. Finally, the lights of the burning boats and the shouts along the shore faded as he slipped back into the darkness from which he had been roused.

The two mines had both gone off, and at nearly the same time.

Perfect.

Gail had waited until she saw at least ten men head towards the western arm of the lagoon, responding to Petra's and Danni's plaintive cries for help. Then she charged up the beach, low to the ground, a black angel of vengeance. The surprised guard never saw or heard her coming, and when her barb sank into his abdomen, pumping him full of her venom, Gail imagined that is how a man felt, planting his seed into a woman. The guard fell noiselessly to the sand, and Pat and Phoebe joined her at the hut. She kept watch while the others woke, fed, and roused the five captives.

Then they all made a mad dash for the beach. It all seemed too easy, until the gunshots rang out. A white hot flash of pain seared her shoulder and another pierced her side, and then the pain faded. Interesting, she thought to her self, getting shot ought to hurt more, and she looked at the ragged tear in her shoulder with fascination, but she didn't stop pushing the boat. It wasn't until nearly an hour later, when Petra pried her fingers off the stern, that she realized how weak she felt, how tired she was.

Her last thought was how beautiful Petra was, even when she was crying.

Danni was alone in the water, her golden hair illuminated by the fire of the burning boats.

She wasn't afraid; John was circling below her. She could feel his electrical pattern though her fringes and along her dorsal ridge. Petra had headed back for the caves as soon as the men headed for the girls, pretending to have drowned, a last minute improvisation that she hoped would lend more urgency to Danni's cries even as it gave her more time to prepare for everyone's return, and it gave Michael permission to swim for Gail, now that he wasn't needed to protect her. Petra had at once thanked whatever forces in the universe that had given them Michael and had provided him with an unerring sense of what she and Gail were thinking.

That left Danni alone with John below, and she sang her siren's song. But she was surprised by the speed of the young man who was charging towards her, determined to rescue her. He was already up to his waist, while most of the men were still a hundred yards down the beach. She could see with her enhanced eyes the dim shapes of Gail, Pat, and Phoebe as they emerged from the other shore. She needed to give them more time, so she tried to keep the determined young man a few yards away while still not giving herself (or her tail) away.

He was a better swimmer than she thought.

As Alberto's man closed on Danni, John shot to the surface. He gathered the intruder into his arms just as the criminal's hand had closed on a fistful of Danni's hair. His powerful tail carried both of them into the air, and Danni gave a cry of pain as a few strands of her thick and full hair came away in the desperado's grasp. John kept his captive in front of his upper torso, letting his steel-gray flanks shine in the light from the burning boats, but keeping his human half behind the struggling and screaming man.

John switched his grip as they came back down into the water, but as they plunged below the surface, he discovered that the man was limp, literally dead weight in his arms-his neck was broken. John hadn't intended to kill him, but nearly 300 pounds of angry merman rushing up from twenty meters below at full force was as good as a head butt from a killer whale. John had simply let the poor man float back to the surface as he circled back beneath between the men and Danni. There were now six men in the water with knives flashing, more determined than ever to rescue (or capture) the beautiful woman struggling in the water.

Moments passed as Danni slowly retreated further into the lagoon, while more men poured into the water, heeding her cries for help.

John had a sudden inspiration and extended his dorsal fin to its maximum height; he surfaced his back in the water between the men and Danni, and twisting his flukes vertically-like a shark's tailfins-and swam with only his dorsal fin, and twisted tailfin visible-towards Danni. Danni, to her great credit, immediately started screaming "Shark, shark," as the rest of the men paused in fear, wondering why the large grey shark that had just struck at their own man was now headed for the still struggling woman. There must be more than one shark! The other one would be feeding on their poor comrade. As John's dorsal fin slipped below the surface, Alberto's men hung back in fear, unable to move towards Danni and unwilling to retreat from such a beautiful woman. Suddenly, in mid-scream, Danni was pulled violently below. As the men dived beneath the waves to find her, they found their comrade instead, floating towards the surface dead, but otherwise unmolested.

That was no shark.

They could see one of their two dinghy's floating further out in the lagoon, but no one made a move to go get it. It looked empty, and the water had not been a safe place to be at night.

As soon as they were far enough away, John twisted the "limp" Danni in his arms, gave her an enormous kiss, and kept swimming with his full force. Danni hung on to his hips and drafted on his strong strokes, and together they caught up to the boat.

With John and Michael on the bowlines, and the five women at the stern, the boat moved fast enough that Martin could have water skied back to the cliffs, if he hadn't already been passed out in the bottom of the boat.

When he reached the hut, he knew what had happened.

Those bitches.

Alberto cursed the gods who were causing such strange events to befall his now shrinking gang of pirates, thieves, and cutthroats. As he watched the latest victim of these strange circumstances float towards shore behind his quickly retreating men, he knew which of his captives had been part of the escape. It was that bitch Mai Lin; she was a feisty one, and he should have killed her long ago, but she was so pretty he couldn't bring himself to do it, that and the few times he thought he had hit her hard enough, the bitch survived. Now this. She had made contact with those women, they had helped her, and the others, escape.

Damn, this island had proved dangerous. From his original twenty-two men, two women and five captives, he was down to fourteen men, two women, and no captives. He wouldn't be shooting anyone else to help maintain discipline; he didn't know how many others were out there. There had been a blonde woman in the water, and now he regretted shooting Hui that morning; that was not a sea monster out there-it was a human. Everyone had seen the woman, perhaps even two, and it didn't matter if that shark got her or not. They were here, on the island, and he and his men had missed them when they were searching for bobby traps. He had to find them. Those caves to the east were a good place to start.

The fleeing dinghy was now gone from his view, having disappeared past the opening of the lagoon. His two magnificent yachts were now at the bottom of the lagoon, only the radio mast from his flagship poked above the surface. That was bad, without those boats, he was stuck here, but he wasn't down for the count. He would find where Mai Lin and the other captives were hiding, and he would make them pay. First, however, he needed to find out which of his remaining men had left the keys to the outboard motor on the dinghy, which had allowed their captives to make an escape. He wasn't too worried, he had another dinghy, and there was only enough gas for an hour's run time in the boat they stole. They wouldn't get far. The one on the beach had a full tank, enough for several hours of searching. He would find them before morning. He started towards the remaining dinghy.

It was then he noticed that it was losing air as it collapsed slowly onto the sand, several holes ripped into the hull.

Shit.

He hated this island, he hated that bitch, and he hated this storm.

"How is she?" Danni asked carefully.

"She's alive," Pat answered, stroking Petra's hair as the sobbing mermaid held Gail's lips firmly to her breast. "She's lost a lot of blood. I can't believe she pushed the boat the whole way back."

"I can't believe I didn't see her wounds," Petra sobbed.

"Don't blame yourself," chided Pat. "You know how she is."

"She's my pod-mate," Petra said angrily. "She's my mate."

"She's our mate," Michael said softly as he rose from the pool, his hand fixing Gail's hair, as she lay unconscious beneath Petra's impressive breast. Gail's lips weren't moving, but she was breathing, and her gills were in the water.

"Oh, Michael," Petra sobbed. "I'm sorry ... I ... I meant."

"Yes, I know," he said softly as he pushed his long body out of the water next to Petra and wrapped his arms around her. He did know what she meant. It was as if Petra had given Gail some of her warmth and sensuality and Gail had given Petra some of her fierce anger. He held his flukes to support Gail's lower tail, hoping that their unconscious mate would feel the love and energy they both were sending to her.

As soon as they discovered her wounds, they had all fed Gail as much milk as they could before she lost consciousness, and then bathed her two wounds in their milk as well, but Gail had lost a lot of blood. Pat had suggested that they keep her gills in the water and her head in the air to maximize the amount of energy her body could draw upon. As far as she could tell, the bullets had passed cleanly through Gail's shoulder and left hip, but given how little she really knew about their new anatomy, she couldn't be sure the hip wound wasn't more serious. In any event, only time would heal Gail, if she could be healed.

She looked around the cave, feeling the soft spray of rain filter down from the chimney above. The storm still lashed at the island, but they had succeeded. Save for Gail's injuries, everyone else had made it back without a scratch.

"Let's go back and reconnoiter," Pat said to John. "You two stay here and help Petra and crew, and if our guests awake, you can begin to explain what's happened to them."

"They don't have a choice, do they?" asked Danni.

"No, not really," sighed Pat. "They drank our milk, and so their journey is inevitable."

Pat leaned over and kissed Petra's forehead and ruffled Michael's hair. She turned to her mate. "Let's go and see how Alberto likes being stuck on an island in a storm," she said, and together they slipped into the water.

Phoebe waddled over to Petra and gave her a kiss too. She then bent down and kissed Gail's cheek. "You did good, girl," she whispered. "I'm so proud of you. You too, my sister-uncle," she said running her finger along Petra's cheek, wiping a tear she found there.

"Why are you proud of me?" Petra asked.

"To many reasons to tell," Phoebe said. "Danni, let's go see if our guests could use some milk, eh?"

As the other two girls busied themselves with the still unconscious guests on the far side of the cave, Michael held tight to his two women, closed his eyes, and willed them to be well. Alberto had had many chances to take Gail from him in the past, and he refused to believe that he could take her from him now. They had come so far, and changed so much. The thought of losing his beautiful Gail, his womanwarrior, the perfect balance to Petra's lush womanhood, was more than he thought he could bear.

"We will get him," Petra whispered into his ear, her voice ragged with emotion. "I will hold him down myself as you and Gail skewer him again, and again."

"I love you," he replied, holding her face to his chest.

The three of them remained like that until morning, when Pat and John returned.

The Moon Pool cave floor was crowded.

Merfolk took up much more room than regular humans, and six of them were spread out on the narrow cave floor that surrounded the Moon Pool. Nestled among them were the five new guests, as they were being called. None had woken during the night; the healing effects of the first draughts of mermaid milk had caused them to swoon just like Daniel (now Danni), Peter (now Petra), Michelle (now Michael), Gail, and Phoebe had before them.

At first, Martin had thought he had woken up from an incredible dream, half nightmare, half mythological wonder. But when the sunlight slowly filtered down from the chimney, and he saw the beautiful Pieta-like tableau of Michael, Petra, and Gail, he pinched himself to make sure he wasn't still dreaming. When a near copy of the mermaid pictured in his diary rose from the pool, he nearly fainted.

It was now late morning, and everyone had learned the story of Pat and John, then Danni, and then the rest. Gail had regained consciousness, and her wounds seemed to have healed, but she was too weak to leave the water. She propped her chin on her hands, while the rest of her floated in the pool behind her.

"We become you?" Shou Ling asked again, looking furtively at Michael, Petra and Gail.

"Not necessarily," Pat explained. "We had to do this to ourselves on purpose. You could end up looking quite differently."

"Why?" asked Martin.

"Because we didn't know what we might otherwise change into," Phoebe said. "We were growing webbing and had already grown our gills, and the changes weren't stopping."

"And you were trapped in this cave, constantly exposed to water," Rikki finished. "You had to take control of what was happening to you."

"Unfortunately, in order to rescue you, we had to put you on the same path," Pat said.

"We WILL become you," Shou Ling said with happy recognition.

"I'm sorry," Pat apologized. "You WANT to become us?"

"Yes," Shou Ling said. "We all die, bit-by-bit, for long time. Now, need new life. You beautiful, different life. I want that life, not my old life. You life, not by trouble, but by choice."

"Do all of you understand what she's suggesting," asked Pat, as she turned to each of them. Ricki, Cleo, Martin, Shou Ling, and all voiced their intent to join them, and then Mai Lin gave a barely perceptible nod. "Well, in that case, there are some logistics we need to work out."

"Like what?" Shou Ling asked.

"Phoebe and I have been going over my notes on the original harems of the painted shell-fish from which the goop was first distilled," Pat explained. "We have a few hypotheses based on the fishes' behavior and our own, at least among our two pods."

"Let's have it," Michael said, as he held Petra in one arm as his other hand trailed into the water to caress Gail's shoulders.

"Phoebe," Pat prompted.

"Three to one seems to be our optimum ratio," Phoebe explained as she gave winks to her three pod mates. "The painted shell fish have harems in a ratio of males to estrus cycles of 36:1, which is to say that there is one male for each 36 possible pregnancies."

"But I thought they lived in harems of 20 to 1," John interrupted.

"Those fish aren't in estrus every month," she continued. "They go into estrus twice a year. We, on the other hand, have periods every month, like normal humans. Thus, the same ratio would be three females to every one male."

"Physiologically and psychologically," Pat added, "there seems to be some advantages to the three to one ratio. Sexually, three females can be kept quite content and connected through one male, whereas four females makes pairing a problem. Two to one makes it necessary for both females to travel with the male, as there is no second female to nest with."

"We nest?" asked Gail from the pool.

"More or less," Pat continued. "Think about what happened to Petra when you and Michael were doing all your patrols. She was crazy with worry."

"I was nuts," Petra smiled, stroking Gail's hair.

"You weren't nuts," Pat corrected. "You had no one to fill the strong pair bond instincts we have. It is sort of like schools of fish, if you like. Our social needs seem to be quite high, and two merfolk at all times-two women or one of each seem to be the minimum necessary."

"The men can pair together without conflict if they are alone," Phoebe explained, "or if they are with one of their pod mates, all is well."

"But if it's just Michael and I," John interrupted, "and one other woman, it doesn't matter whose pod-mate she is ... "

"We can barely control ourselves," Michael finished, "even though we really like each other. It does seem to be hard wired into us."

"Which brings us back to the logistical problem," Pat said. "There are five of you, three of whom are blood related. If Martin assumes podleadership, we take a double jeopardy chance on the off-spring from both sisters, or we separate one sister away, which ... "

"Isn't going to happen," Cleo said softy. "We're triplets ... I couldn't abandon my brother and sister."

"But could you mate with your brother?" asked Phoebe.

"Ewwwee" Cleo responded. "No offense, Martin."

"None taken," he said calmly.

"What about us?" Gail asked.

"I don't know," Pat said, "but your pod won't have three blood related pairs, and so even if you and Michael prove infertile, Petra and any new pod-mates would be fine."

"Ah," Gail mused, "besides, Petra will probably have a million kids given the way she mothers us."

"Martin, you haven't told them yet, have you," Rikki asked.

"No," he whispered.

"Why?" she asked.

After a moment of awkward silence, Petra suddenly realized, "It was your diary, wasn't it?" Everyone turned to her with a look of surprise. "Well, it takes one to recognize one. I mean, we all just assumed it was Cleo's or Rikki's."

"You have my diary?" Martin choked out?

Phoebe reached behind her and pulled a plastic wrapped book from a crag in one of the rocks. She handed it to Martin. As he pulled the book from its protective covering, he gasped in surprise and delight.

"They found it," he exclaimed. "How did you find it?

"It was on your parent's boat, which washed ashore a few weeks before you all showed up," Pat explained. "We gave the unrecognizable bodies on the deck a burial at sea, and then set booby traps in the boat for Alberto's men."

"We are all so sorry," Petra said.

There was a long moment of silence as the three Henderson children fought to control their emotions.

"We ... we ... will mourn later ... when Alberto is dead," Rikki said firmly.

"Where ... how ... how did you know it was my diary?" Martin asked.

"I was a life-long cross-dresser before I changed into this lovely form," Petra said. "I actually wanted to become a woman, not like Pat and Danni who become women accidentally."

"And I wanted to become a man," Michael added, stroking Petra's hair, "because my life as a woman had left me unsatisfied. We're both happier now."

"We are ALL happier, now," Gail said.

"So, it is your diary?" Phoebe said.

"Yes," he said. "It's mine. I wrote it, and now you transformed yourself into the creature of my dreams. My sisters have always known that I wanted to be their sister, not their brother. Ever since I can remember, I've wanted to be a sister to my sisters."

"And, you wanted to be a mermaid," Cleo teased. "Always making us swim like dolphins as we were growing up."

"And, always stealing our clothes from our closets," Rikki teased. "At least now, we wouldn't have to worry about clothes here."

"Who become man then?" asked Shou Ling.

"I do," Mai Lin said firmly.

"What?" asked Shou Ling, "What happen to me?"

"You become our pod-mate," Petra said firmly, but gently. "I have more than enough love for all of you," she argued as she lifted one of her large breasts towards Shou Ling, who blushed.

"Well, that solves the logistics problem, we have genetic diversity among the pods," Pat said with surprise. "But I didn't expect so neat a solution," Pat mused. "Is everyone sure of what we are about to do?" She checked everyone's faces for agreement. She saw the same sparkle in their eyes now as she saw in Gail's eyes first time they had beheld Phoebe's beauty after her transformation. "The question now is, how will we do it. One or two stages?"

"One," Phoebe said.

"Why only one?" Pat asked.

"They've only had two servings of milk," she responded, "but they are already starting to change, subtle changes so far, except for one big one."

"What big one is that?" Pat asked noting that she couldn't see any major differences in their guests other than that were all healthy and conscious.

"Their gills have already appeared," Phoebe said, "way ahead of schedule."

"Oh, my god," Cleo exclaimed, "You've got red marks on your backs just like them," she said while pointing at her brother's exposed back.

All the guests checked their backs, and indeed, they had gills from only two feedings of mermaid milk.

"The active agents in our milk is getting stronger and stronger," Phoebe concluded. "I think that if we all go to the pool, and combine our fluids, energy, and focus, they can all make it through in one stage. Otherwise ... "

"They-and we-might not be able to "control" their changes. You're right Phoebe," Pat concluded. "Does everyone understand our situation?"

"Because your milk is stronger, we will change more quickly than you did," Martin offered. "And if we don't "will" our changes, we may end up as something other than what we wish."

"Right, but there is good news," Pat continued. "As we have all discovered, the more energy and focus there is, the easier it is to control the change. So, as each new mermaid is created, the process should get faster and easier."

"We don't know how many feeders any one person can actually hold," worried John. "Remember how hard it was for you to reach your last feeder?"

"It was a lot of work," Pat said, "but the only way to find out is to try."

"Gail," Petra asked, "are you feeling up for this?"

"I wouldn't miss it, not even if I was already dead," she said with a grin.

Martin sat nervously in the early evening moonlight, his feet dangling in the water, trying to watch what was going on below him in the pool. Rikki was in the center of the circle, her body glowing with energy, her tail nearly finished. He was next; actually, he was last. They had discovered that none of the "guests" could stay down in the water for long; their gills were too immature. Mai Lin had gone first, while Michael and John had stayed out of the water so that all the women could focus their energy to help Mai Lin transition to a male mermaid. Cleo and Rikki added their focus to that first circle too, but they had to keep rising for air every ten minutes or so. Their immature gills allowed them to stay down longer than normal humans, but they still had to breath regular air. Still, they bobbed up and down for the entire time, knowing that Mai Lin was becoming their pod-mate.

Mai Lin, or Mu Su, as he renamed himself, didn't have to keep rising up, however. Once under the influence of the massive dose of milk, her/his gills had started working quickly, and he was able to stay down for the duration. He took eleven hours to transition. Mu Su, whose new name meant, "longed for revival," then became the "first feeder" for Shou Ling, and the group discovered that men were not nearly as potent as the women. Shou Ling had to rise for a breath of air despite swallowing Mu Su's impressive load, but once Petra had given her a double dose of milk from her impressive breasts, Shou Ling was well on her way. Her "last feeder" was Michael, since she was joining his pod, and he experienced the longest orgasm of his life, shooting pulse after pulse into her trance-like embrace. Shou Ling hung in the water, glowing and changing, for only eight hours. She renamed herself Xing Hua, or "new flower."

There seemed to be a geometric relationship between the potency of the fluids and the number of people contributing. After Cleo finished in only six hours, Phoebe bet Pat that Rikki would be done in four hours. Pat said three, but that Martin would take one hour. Both Phoebe and Martin had nearly choked on their food. Mu Su was the last feeder for Rikki, and for Cleo since they were joining his pod, and Rikki was nearly done, less than three hours later.

That thought both frightened him and filled him with excitement. Trying to understand the titanic forces at work in their bodies as they changed their form, and in his case, his sex, was difficult. Trying to imagine those same forces at work in a mere hour was beyond him. What would it feel like? He had dipped down, from time to time, to watch as his sisters changed. Rikki's transition seemed to be even more violent than was Cleo's, her rigid body rippling and convulsing, twisting and shaking. Cleo had reassured him during that last meal break, that she didn't feel much discomfort, and now that she was fully transformed, she felt better than ever before in her life.

He remembered back to the first time he stole his sister's underwear. They were 12, and Cleo and Rikki were blossoming into beautiful young women. Martin was a little jealous of all the attention they were getting, and when his puberty hit a year later, he grew more and more awkward and unhappy with his body. Slowly but inexorably, he had been shut out from his two best playmates, and he wished with growing fervor that he had been born one of three identical twins, rather than a fraternal twin to two identical twins. So, he had retreated into his imagination, his diary, and the world of magic, where things like mermaids existed.

A sudden movement below stirred him from his reverie. Rikki's glowing body suddenly arched backwards, a signal that she would be shortly released from the grip of transition. Mermaids weren't magic any more, Martin mused. He would become one himself soon.

As with the other transitions, the group rose as one and fell upon the food that they had gathered in anticipation of their guests before their rescue. Martin, who wasn't hungry at all, watched the colorful and beautiful crush of merfolk as they jostled each other to reach for the food. Cleo and Rikki were identical twins still, both beautiful with perfectly even, mottled blue and white scales with yellow highlights along their fins, flukes, webs, and dorsal ridges. Their shining blue eyes were even bluer, jewel-like in their intensity. Their short dark brown hair was now a long and lustrous chocolate brown that flowed down to their expanded hips. Their full C cups had remained the same, which made them look girlish next to Petra and Pat, but they were about the same as the rest of the mermaids. Like them, their nipples had matured and were thicker and longer than previously.

"You sure you don't want to eat," asked Cleo, twisting her upper torso 180 degrees without moving her tail as it stretched out behind her. "It will help you later," she nudged Rikki and they both giggled girlishly.

Pat had explained to them at the last feeding that when they were all changed, sleep would finally take them, but only after their sexual appetites had been sated. Petra and Gail explained that the transition would really make them feel like new people-that they were a new species even-and that the abuse at the hands of Alberto's men would slowly wash away. John teased Mu Su that he would likely be put to the test with three newly transitioned mermaids to deal with. He had merely smiled, a coiled spring of confident, new manhood, which had made Cleo and Rikki swoon with anticipation, and even Martin was excited thinking about being held by Mu Su's strong arms, being pressed to his washboard stomach, and feeling his impressive cock push its way into his body.

Martin walked over to his sisters, thinking that he wouldn't be doing that for much longer, and reached for some dried fish. He was even a bit embarrassed that he had an erection in anticipation of what Cleo had meant.

"You soon beautiful on outside as you were on inside," Mu Su said gently, "I happy you are excited to be beautiful. Feel no shame in erection, for I know how you feel, and soon ... you know how I felt when I was girl."

"Thanks, Mu Su," Martin blushed. "I hope you will like me when I am a girl."

"You, I have liked always," he responded as he gave Martin's face a gentle caress, "you I will never forget, your kindness and courage before."

"You are as handsome now as you were beautiful before," Martin said with a quaver in his voice. "Inside and outside."

Mu Su was striking with his strongly featured face, jet-black hair, his broad shoulders and strong hands, his yellow and black striped tail with yellow highlights, and his dark brown, nearly black eyes. Martin let his gaze wash over his soon-to-be pod-mate.

"Hey, don't hog," teased Rikki as she poked her brother in the ribs. "You're going to have to share."

"All right, enough," teased Xing. "Let's go in pool and do last one, so all can get (cough, cough) rest."

"I've got your rest, you minx," Michael said, slapping his tail suggestively.

Xing was a minx, whose new coloring subtly complimented her pod-mates. Her tail was a dark forest green with lavender highlights on fins, flukes, webs, and dorsal membrane, the opposite of Petra. She had the only hazel eyes of the pod, but she shared Michael's and Gail's jetblack hair. Her Asian features were still visible, and her C cup breasts looked positively enormous on her slender frame. "O.K., I ready for many rests," she said smiling.

"In the water, both of you," Petra said, mothering. "Let's all go," as she took Gail's hand, gave her a peck on the cheek, and dove into the pool.

Martin took a deep breath and dove into the center of the pool. His slender body sliced down cleanly through the water, and he pulled up even with the assembled group. They looked beautiful in the moonlight, glowing and pulsing with energy. Rikki reached out her arms to him, and he floated to her.

"What will my new sister's name be?" she asked.

"Emma," he answered. His two sisters smiled in recognition and approval. It was their mother's name.

"You will be my sister-wife, will you take from my breasts your tail," she intoned.

"Yes, ... oh god, yes," Martin whispered fervently, and he fell upon his sister's large nipple.

He drank deeply, feeling the pressure in his lungs lessen with each gulp, and when he had finished both breasts, he floated effortlessly to Cleo.

"Sister from birth, and sister-wife from this day forward," Martin sang, like all those before, "will you give me my tail?"

"Come, drink from me my sister, who has been my sister always in truth," Cleo said with a sad smile for the little brother that had been so unhappy for so many years.

Martin felt the energy build in his body as he drank from Cleo's breasts. He could feel Rikki, who had floated down to his legs, and was slowly stroking them up and down, sending tremors throughout his body. He focused on the strong and powerful mermaid that Phoebe had helped coach him on, one that was identical to his sisters, an identical triplet he had always wished he could be. Cleo's breasts had been generous, and he turned to Michael as he felt Cleo join her sister at his legs.

"Merman who was once a woman," Martin intoned, "make this boy a mermaid, and give me my tail."

Michael tugged free his quickly expanding cock, and looked down at Martin. The combined forces of his sister's milk were already at work on his body, his features softening, his hair growing, his body changing. Martin tentatively took hold of his cock, and Michael waited patiently, he knew this was a moment of mental transition for Martin. After a few seconds, Martin slowly put his lips over the head of Michael's long and thick cock. He was surprised, even though he had seen it with his sisters, when Michael's cock immediately erupted into his mouth. He swallowed urgently, but some cum leaked out into the water. Petra eased forward and sucked the strand of ropy cum from the water.

"Waste not, want not, Emma," she said as she shared a kiss with Gail and Xing.

Emma ... yes, now Emma, she thought to herself as her mind focused more clearly on the changes she was undergoing, turned to Petra, and asked for her tail, and when she had drained Petra's bounty, she could feel that she was transitioning quickly into a woman. She could feel her waist narrowing, slowly but steadily, and her hips expanding, reshaping themselves, even as her legs grew stiff and straight. The hips had hurt, but not as much as she thought it might.

During the time it took for Emma to pass from Petra to Gail and then to Xing, she became a woman completely. Emma delighted as her nipples expanded, and then slowly pushed out, pushing into Xing's tummy as she suckled at her breast. Now, as she floated away from Xing, she could feel the firm weight of her C cup breasts hang from her narrow rib cage, her long hair floating over her shoulders and gills, and her delicate and feminine body as it moved through the water. She knew her face was changing, matching her sisters'. Still, there was great energy gathered in her body, pulsing up and down and in and out.

Now fully a woman, she reached for John. "First father of first pod, give me my tail," she sang. She was ready for John's healthy deposit, and Pat, Danni, and Phoebe shared a wink with Petra and company because no extras escaped from Emma's eager mouth this time. Her body was now glowing, filling with power and energy.

"First mother, first woman, give me my tail," Emma sang as she fell onto Pat's breasts. As she finished with Pat and moved onto Danni, she could feel her sisters pull away from her legs, and she was dimly aware that they had already begun to knit together. Phoebe's breasts were next, and Emma was quivering as she struggled to maintain control. She had to get to Mu Su; he had to be last.

"Phoebe, give me my tail," Emma asked. Phoebe pulled the desperately shaking Emma to her breast where she sucked eagerly at her nipple. Phoebe could tell that Emma was close, and that the forces she was battling were enormous. Phoebe concentrated on merely giving milk to her, not the bonding orgasm that simmered close to the surface of her breasts. For long agonizing moments, she held off her own release, forcing both herself and Emma to wait for Mu Su. Then, she was done, and Phoebe was practically gasping with need, but she exerted a supreme effort of self-control, and rejoined the humming that surrounded the beautiful half-creature that swirled before them.

Emma slowly turned to Mu Su, a great need burning in her eyes, her body quaking as she struggled to hold on. "My mate ... my Mu Su ... give ... me ... me ..." As Emma struggled to maintain control, Mu Su raised his stiff cock up to her lips and held it there. "Give ... me ... my ... TAIL," Emma shouted and gulped Mu Su's thick and long cock as far down her throat as she could. His eruption was instantaneous, and Rikki and Cleo had to hold him in place, so that his own convulsions would not remove his cock from Emma's mouth. He had never felt anything so powerful, such a ripping out from the depths of his body a portion of his own being. In six enormous spurts, he gave Emma her last dose, and she released his cock and stiffened into the familiar cross of transformation, her arms outstretched horizontally, her legs rigidly pointing to the pool's bottom.

Emma's final transformation seemed magical as they watched her body shift, throb, shake, push, and change. For Emma, she felt great waves that pulsed from her still new womb and radiated out through her entire body. Then a great urge to push arose, and she bore down with her muscles onto her rigid legs, feeling bone, muscle, and blood break, merge, and reform. She convulsed again, pushing, pushing, pushing, and felt her new appendage lengthen and her flukes emerge. Her newly forming swimming muscles wove their way through her body, pulsing in her tail, and threading up through her pelvis and torso. She convulsed again, and felt her skin change, and her webbing appear. She convulsed again, and felt her hair lengthen again, and her organs shift, strengthen, and change. Then she arched in ecstasy, her shimmering blue and white tail, mottled with even spots of color, hanging above her shining eyes.

It had taken less than an hour.

Emma could sense the passion and release that was filling the pool with electrical energy from every direction. Even with her eyes closed, she could both sense and actually hear the frenzied sexual activity from both John's and Michael's pods. This was no surprise; everyone had been forewarned. It was just that Mu Su's pod was new to the incredible feelings and sensations that their new bodies were sending them in the wake of their transformations.

Emma was finally a girl, even better ... a mermaid! After years as an awkward, shy, and sensitive male, who missed the closeness his twin sisters had shared with him for most of his seventeen years, the newest mermaid was still sorting out all the signals that her now identical body sent. Like Cleo and Rikki, Emma was a beautiful mermaid, with long dark hair, piercing blue eyes, an hour-glass figure with firm, full C cup breasts topped by full and chewy nipples, her breasts already swelling with her own milk.

Emma ran her hands along her narrow chin, swan-like neck, across the swell of her breasts, feeling the stiff promontory of her nipples, following the curve underneath back to her rib cage, a full four inches behind her tightly clenched nipples, and then down across her slim, flat stomach and a tiny waist. The soft swell of her female belly warmed her, made her womb throb pleasantly in her lower abdomen. She felt the slightest change in texture as her skin merged with the brightly mottled blue and white scales that marked the beginning of her tail even as her slim waist flared out to wide, sensuous hips, that could now flex in both directions. Her tail extended a full five feet beyond her hips, sinuously undulating in the water, a beautiful tail with wide flukes, over three feet across, in which she could feel the water move across her scales like a lover's caress.

Emma had a momentary regret, never having felt what wide hips did for a woman's gait, the gap between her legs where her pussy would have been. However, a flash of luminescence that ran up the length of her dorsal membrane reminded her of the benefits she did have. Her flukes fanned out in a quivering expression of her mounting sexual need, as her sisters reached out to her to draw her towards Mu Su.

He floated there before her, his magnificent yellow and black tail gently stroking the water back and forth, his dark back eyes seeming to pierce her through her heart, and his jet-black hair streaming down his shoulders, his broad and very muscular shoulders, she noted. She could see that his long cock was already freed from his interior vent, a long, thick throbbing appendage that was a foot long, its head swollen with his passion. Emma's two sisters had argued that Mu Su and she were the only "virgins" in their pod, the sisters having been raped countless times by Alberto's men, and therefore, they should be the first "true" coupling. Their generosity was tempered, in Emma's mind, by the knowledge that Pat had shared with them about mermale anatomy, namely that his hip fins stiffened and vibrated when his cock was similarly stimulated. The result was that three mermaids could find nearly equal pleasure from their pod-mate at the same time.

Rikki's hand was on Mu Su's cock, stroking it slowly, while Cleo's hand was on Emma's breast, stroking her nipple. Emma could see that both of her sisters were equally aroused, their genital vents were open and pulsing, their clitoral ridge exposed and ready for stimulation. All three sister's breasts were swollen with passion, ready to push milk from their breasts at the moment of climax. Mu Su reached with his hand to Emma's graceful neck, and pulled her into a passionate kiss. Their tongues dueled as Emma pushed her breasts into his chest, his cock poking her in her belly. Cleo settled onto Mu Su's left shoulder, and Rikki grabbed his right one, still stroking his cock with the other hand. They both pushed their clits against Mu Su's pelvic fins, which had stiffened and were beginning to vibrate slightly, and wrapped their tails around his and each other's. They both started rubbing their own breasts against Mu Su's elbow fins, delighting as their nipples caught on his scalloped edges.

Emma's heart felt like it would explode from her chest. She knew what was expected, but she had never had the equipment to perform this sexual act. She could feel her pelvic region swollen with blood and need, but she didn't know where all her parts actually were. She wrapped her own tail around her sisters' and Mu Su's, and tried to push his cock into her hungry vagina. She missed, and Mu Su gasped as his cock caught on her pelvic fin.

"Sorry," she whispered.

"It is O.K.," he nuzzled her lips as he replied, "take your time."

Her sisters solved the problem as Rikki guided Mu Su's cock directly into her opening while Cleo pushed against Emma's hips, guiding her down onto him. Emma gasped into Mu Su's kiss as she felt the large head of his cock slip past her outer lips and into her pussy. She held her hips steady, accommodating herself to his great thickness and to the impending loss of her very brief virginity. She could feel herself begin to relax internally, and pushed again until his cockhead met the stiff resistance of her newly created womanhood. She pushed a second time, but met the same resistance.

"Try to relax," Mu Su whispered into her ear as he nuzzled her neck and ear lobe. "I lost my virginity once too."

He caressed her sides, following the dramatic contours of her waist and hips until he grabbed her pelvic fins and pulled her into him using their entwined tails to push himself into her. Their combined efforts succeeded, and after a sharp, brief pain, Emma felt her insides melting as the fullness of his cock stretched her completely. Then he began to move, and the heat from Mu Su's strokes rose as he built up speed and rhythm. Emma looked at her sister Cleo, who was now concentrating on what Mu Su's fin was doing to her clit, her eyes glazed with passion, but flickered with love and recognition as she saw her new sister gazing at her. She lifted a hand from Emma's hip where she no longer needed to guide her sister's hips onto their husband-pod-mate, and stroked Emma's face and her full lips, now identical to her own. Emma kissed her sisters fingers, even as she felt Mu Su's cock swell with in her, reaching up into her torso to places she never thought possible.

Emma turned to Rikki, who was also caught in the throes of a steadily building orgasm, her bright blue eyes lidded and sightless, one hand clutched on Mu Su's neck, the other on Emma's hip, pushing her pelvis against Mu Su's fin, her breasts brushing his arm. Emma looked back into Mu Su's eyes, his dark, strong eyes, and saw the glimmering of a break in his calm, confident exterior. She could see his building need, his first orgasm caused by love making, rather than by mermaid making. She thrilled to the passion and lust she saw in his eyes, the raw need visible in his eyes that drank in her face, her hair, her neck, her breasts as they shook in the water with each powerful thrust by Mu Su. She could feel her flesh quiver in response to each thrust, her hips, her muscles along the back of her tail, and her lovely breasts.

Emma could feel the building tensions of her first female orgasm, building a rising tide of tension in her womb and stomach wall, pushing down on Mu Su's cock as it stroked in and out. She lifted up her face and reached for Mu Su's lips, and he bent down, still stroking powerfully in and out of her vagina, and kissed her. Her body imploded, and her cunt walls clenched down on Mu Su's powerful cock. He gasped into their kiss, and he exploded his hot semen into her. She could feel the throb of his cock inside her, the power of each pulse as his cock pushed past her powerful, rippling muscles inside her birth canal, forcing his seed deep within her. She could feel her breasts release their milk into the water, and she could feel the warm spurts of milk from her sisters as they joined her in their release. For the longest time, she was suspended in the water by Mu Su's stiff cock still pulsing within her, with her entire body still clenching around that welcome invader.

She fell asleep some hours later, the moonlight now barely visible, and the other pods had long ago succumbed to sleep. Emma had just thrashed through her sixth orgasm of the evening, this one on Mu Su's right hip, as Cleo felt the power and warmth of Mu Su's endlessly ready cock buried deep with in her.

"That is the first time I've had an orgasm while getting fucked," Cleo said in surprise.

"It won't be the last," Mu Su assured her, as he wrapped his strong arms around all three identical sisters and gave them a hug. Emma gave Cleo a peck on the cheek even as she snuggled next to her, sharing Mu Su's chest as her pillow with her two sisters, their tails entwined now in love and comfort, rather than passion and need. Her last thought was that now they could make some plans to deal with Alberto's men, and that it would be fun.

### 06 - The Battle for Mermaid Island

The first three were an accident-luck really.

Phoebe and Pat were giving Mu Su's pod and Xing (all the newest merfolk) their third "teaching tour" around the island. In the two weeks since their transformations, they had been keeping clear of the original lagoon, and were careful not to be too close to the surface. They were focusing on reefs and other places along the drop-off where they could gather food, not the island itself. The rest of Michael's pod (because Xing was with the tour) was on spy duty that morning while John and Danni were in the Listening Room. Pat smiled as she thought of her pod mates back in the listening room. Unlike Danni, who was no doubt trying to distract John from listening, these newest mermaids were all eager students. They had made significant headway in their efforts to collect a food surplus in anticipation of their up-coming battle.

This morning they were moving along the sharp, drop-off along the north side of the island working their way to the eastern caves. There was only a very short land shelf along the north side, and there was no land shelf along the western side where the entrance to their system of home caves lay hidden. To the east and south, however, a large land shelf had built up from many eruptions of the volcano that was the father of this island. Pat explained that the drop-off was boundary between the father island and the mother sea, and that their union produced the bounty upon which the mermaid's lives depended. The eastern land shelf sloped more quickly than the southern one, so that the waves that rose to crash on these rocks formed quickly and suddenly, only about ten meters from the rocky shore. There were many shallow caves scattered among the rocky beaches, but they were not interconnected as their "home caves" were, and no system of tunnels existed here.

The group was about twenty meters from the shore in five meters of water, harvesting mollusks. Pat had created "sea bags" from some plastic netting Michael and Gail had salvaged from the drop-off. The bags were secured around their hips with holes for their pelvic fins, allowing them good flexibility along their tails while keeping their hands free for harvesting and swimming. Mu Su had the biggest bag, and he was a very quick study, memorizing the many different types of squids, chitons, univalves, tusk shells, bivalves, and octopi. Of course, Xing and Mu Su had grown up eating exotic animals, unlike everyone else, and that helped too. The others were slowly learning and adapting to what was edible and what wasn't.

Pat sighed happily as she watched everyone at work harvesting. The triplets were naturals in the water, and as she watched them dart in and out of the coral, laughing and playing even as they worked-it was hard to tell them apart. Everyone had discovered, however, that each of them had a very different personality. Rikki and Cleo had taken some time to come out of their emotional shells, but the last two weeks had brought some healing. Cleo was the graceful, reserved one, and she was unfailingly gentle. Rikki was the prankster, usually pulling practical jokes, but she was also the leader of her sisters, willing and ready to take risks. Emma was the mother, the worrier, and the budding scientist who nevertheless was also the most girlish of the triplets, reveling in her newfound femininity. Even though they were identical triplets, each of their tails were subtly different, and-more importantly for mermaids-their electrical signatures were easily distinguishable from one another.

All three girls were devoted to Mu Su, who returned their devotion. His dramatic, tiger-stripped tail flashed in the morning sun. He was also a gentle spirit, but his martial arts training gave him a coiled confidence that his girls adored, and Pat and the others also appreciated. He was also randy as hell, and both he and Emma were insatiable. They were constantly teasing and flirting with one another, even when there was work to be done.

Pat probed behind her with her mermaid senses and found Xing and Phoebe hard at work on the other side of the rock outcropping upon which she sat. Xing had bonded well with Michael's pod, and this morning's teaching tour was the first time she had ventured out without one of her pod mates. She and Phoebe were working together, however, which seemed to give her some confidence.

Pat stretched out her senses, taking stock of the surrounding sea. Mu Su's pod was about forty meters further south, while Phoebe and Xing were just behind her. Pat was perched only about two meters below the surface, and she could sense the water as it rose and crashed into the rocks along the shore. She realized suddenly with a clench of fear in her gut that she could sense three men among the caves behind her. She quickly slid down the rock to Phoebe and Xing.

"You sensed it too?" Phoebe asked.

"Three men, the second cave down," Pat said as both Phoebe and Xing nodded. Pat sent out a high pitch pulse of vocal energy that they had discovered was an excellent underwater alarm, and a few moments later, Mu Su and the girls swam up to them.

"What's up?" Rikki asked.

Pat pointed with her hand to the shore, where the only sounds they could hear were the rolling waves as they crashed into the rocks. Everyone focused their senses up towards the beach.

"Three men, second cave down," Rikki said.

"The sea must be high today," Phoebe noted, "the water seems very loud."

"There might be a storm further east," Pat surmised, "and the rising waves seem to have trapped those three in that smaller cave."

"I'll go take a look," Mu Su offered. "The surf sounds a bit strong for you ladies."

"Ha," shot back Rikki, "I'll race you!"

"No, Rikki, don't," asked Emma. "The surf is high, and Mu Su's a much stronger swimmer than we are, and he can fight through the backwash. We can't. It's also nearing high tide."

"High tide is only about a meter," Rikki argued.

"But with a storm to the east, it's much higher than normal," Emma said. "That's probably why those men got trapped in the water."

Mu Su gave a quick kiss to Rikki as consolation, and swam off towards the crashing surf. The girls spent a few tense minutes waiting, and then he returned.

"The sea is high, and the men are up to their chests in water," he explained. "The backwash isn't too bad in the cave, but it's strong enough that those men aren't trying to get out the front of the cave. It's only about two meters deep, but they aren't moving."

"Did they have any guns?" Pat asked.

"I couldn't see any," he said, "but I didn't get that close."

"We should call the others," Pat recommended.

"No," Phoebe said quietly but firmly, "we don't have time."

Pat looked around at the group and realized that all of them except for her had suffered deeply at the hands of Alberto's men. These new mermaids and mermen were not going to let this opportunity pass them by. For the past two weeks, the remaining gang members had stayed far away from the water, and most had moved up to the mountainside huts. Their absence from the water, and the knowledge that the merfolk's mobility on anything other than the beach would be difficult and impossible on narrow jungle paths, had frustrated everyone. They might now control the water, but little could be done if Alberto and his men stayed away from it.

"First," Pat chided, "everyone breathe. I know this is personal for you, but I will not go back to Michael and tell him that his pod-mate got killed because we weren't thinking." Xing smiled tightly at the reference to her status.

"I no get killed," she said with determination.

"Nevertheless," Pat said steadily, "we need a plan. How long before the tide begins to ebb?" she asked Phoebe.

Phoebe closed her eyes and concentrated, feeling the water along the rocks, sensing which direction it was moving, and how quickly.

"High tide crested about an hour ago," she reported. "That gives us about two hours before the water is low enough for these guys to escape."

"Mu Su, how big was that cave?" Pat asked.

"Thirty meters deep, about ten meters at mouth and five meters wide, rear of cave," he reported.

"Alright," Pat said, "here's the plan."

Gail felt Petra's warm flanks next to her own as they wriggled to their usual spot for spying on the beach huts, hidden in the undergrowth along the western arm of the lagoon. For the past two weeks, there had been very little activity at the beach huts. Alberto and his remaining men had retreated to the mountainside huts soon after the rescue attempt. The only exception was the two women, who still came down to their beach hut nearly every day, but they rarely come down into the water. They came down to cook, mostly, and usually three men came too, using the beach tackle that they had brought ashore before their boats had been sunk. One man always stayed up the beach, armed with a gun, while the other two pulled in fish from the lagoon. Afterwards, the women would clean and prepare the fish and take it back up the mountainside.

This morning was different. No men had come down to fish. Both women were in the surf, bathing each other. Gail and the others had learned from the Mu Su and Xing, who had spent the longest in captivity, that one of the women, Angara, was a cousin of Alberto. He let them keep one another company, and in return expected his own domestic needs to be met. He would occasionally demand the sexual services from the women, but he preferred captives whom he could beat, rape, and kill with impunity. Mu Su had thought that they might become allies for the merfolk, but they didn't know how they might go about contacting them, nor could Mu Su be sure of their loyalties to Alberto. He knew both Angara and her lover, Saya, despised most of the gang, but Alberto was "family." Finally, Mu Su had never heard them speak anything other than Spanish, and so he didn't know if they even understood English or Chinese, the two languages the pods could currently speak.

"Any body else coming?" whispered Petra as she settled next to her sister-wife.

"Not yet," Gail said. "What's that on the beach, near their clothing?"

"I'm not sure," Petra said, trying to keep her head down even as she raised herself up to peer at the beach where the women had left their clothes.

"We need to get closer," Gail said, starting to wiggle backwards towards the surf on the far side of the spit of land that enclosed the lagoon.

"We need Michael," Petra urged as she followed her lover back to the water.

As usual, Michael had already figured out what their collective thoughts were, and met them in the middle of the lagoon. They decided that they would chance a possible contact, but wouldn't reveal their status as mermaids. They swam slowly towards the beach, keeping close to the bottom so that they wouldn't be spotted by any lookout posted at the hot tub high above on the mountain. When they reached a depth of about two meters, about fifteen meters from shore, Gail rose to the surface. Petra and Michael watched carefully, their senses fully extended, concentrating on the reaction of the two women who were in the surf, with the water lapping at their knees.

Gail kept her head low to the water, as there was only a gentle swell of a few inches here in the lagoon, but the women were not looking out at the water, but rather at the spot on the beach where the trail came down from the mountain. They were worried about being caught by some of the gang members as they bathed in the surf. Figures, Gail thought to herself, the men could probably go for weeks without bathing, but the women would be more fastidious. The two women took no notice of her as she peered carefully at the scene before her.

The two women were short, as with most Filipinos, and while it was difficult to tell how old they were, they were both well beyond thirtyfive. They might have been prettier in their younger days, but life as the nursemaids to a pirate/drug gang had not been kind to them. It was then that Gail noticed what was on the beach.

"Help us."

In English, scratched into the sand with a stick, next to their clothes.

Danni and John lay on a small ledge that formed part of the listening room. Danni had insisted that they spend a long time out of the water, and so they had been lying together on the cave floor for over an hour. John didn't understand why she wanted to lie on the hard, rocky floor of the cave when they could float in the pool with ease and still hear all the listening channels that snaked throughout the island. In the past two days, they had learned that Alberto's men had talked themselves out of their fear of the water, with the two women leading the argument. The merfolk had to piece things together as the infrequent English phrases echoed down only occasionally. The gang had to speak English occasionally because it was the only common language among the mixed Filipino, Thai, and Australian gang members.

This morning the two women had asked for and gotten a promise of some privacy for bathing, and the men would come down to the beach the next day for fishing and feasting. Two of Alberto's men had fixed the remains of the still that John and Pat had built, and after many days of trying, their first batch of distilled fruit punch would be ready the next day. Alberto had encouraged these plans to build morale, and the men had gone off to harvest food and game from the jungle while the women went to the beach to bath, fish, and prepare for tomorrow's feast.

As the listening posts quieted down, Danni lay next to John in the semi-darkness of the room and concentrated on feeling dry. She knew it was silly, but she was still adjusting to the fact that she was now a marine mammal, of sorts. Her gills, which were not a typical mammalian characteristic, where cushioned from the cave floor by both her thick, soft golden hair and by her dorsal ridge that reached mid-way up her back. Her flukes were splayed over John's tail, softly stroking his strong muscles that rippled up and down his impressive steel grey tail.

She loved the feel of his strong, smooth flanks as they rippled under the feathery edges of her flukes. It was sort of like feeling with her toes, she thought. She concentrated on her tail, trying to remember her legs, feet, and toes, but her tail didn't feel like her legs were still there, bound up and moving together. Her tail felt like, well, her tail. It was strong and thick, but supple and flexible at the same time. She flexed her muscles that made her flukes spread, and then lifted her flukes 90 degrees up and then pushed them down, easily reaching 90 degrees in both directions. John began playing with his own flukes as she twisted hers 180 degrees clockwise, and then again counter clockwise, her wispy blue fringe that decorated the ends of her fluke sparkling with faint blue light as the cool air whispered through her fringe membranes. That rush of sensation prompted the memory of when her beautiful sister-wife, Pat, had explained how her sparkling blue dorsal membrane, now pleasantly squished by Danni's own weight into the cave floor, was also one of her main sensory organs. In fact, all her fringes on fins, flukes, and dorsal ridge could feel temperature and texture, and were a part of how she felt her way in dark tunnels, sensing the world around her.

She lowered her tail back onto John's, caressing him again, trickling her fluke-fringes over his steel-gray tail, brushing herself back and forth against him. She felt his warmth up and down along her tail, his smooth scales rubbing hers, his muscles twitching beneath her flukes as she tickled him. Their pelvic fins also played a game of pattyfingers, brushing and stroking one another. Her whole body felt alive with touch, and her heart was pounding in her chest. God, she loved being a mermaid; a beautiful powerful, golden tail, her long golden hair, her silvery laughter, her hourglass figure, her firm, full breasts with their long, sensitive nipples, her delicate hands and glimmering fingernails. She was intoxicated and intoxicating.

As Danni lay on her back, her head nestled in the crook of John's strong arm, she lifted one hand up to her breast. She had gotten so used to feeling her body in the water that she really wanted to feel her body on the land. Here, her breasts sagged off to each side, but only a little, and she enjoyed the small tightness at the center of her chest as each breast tugged slightly outward. She watched as her breasts rose and fell with her steady breathing. She enjoyed the feeling of air rushing through her nostrils, something that didn't happen when she was under water. Her gaze followed her ribs down as they narrowed quickly to her delicate waist, which seemed all the more delicate for being perched atop her strong and beautiful mermaid's tail. She ran her hand around her breasts, one at a time, savoring their fullness. She pulled at one of her long nipples, rolling it in between her index and thumb, her webbing rustling along her hand as she did so.

Her groin tightened, sending tendrils of warmth radiating outward from her belly and tail. She could feel her labia opening, nearly two hand spans below her belly button. When they had transformed into mermaids and mermen, their sexual organs had dropped slightly into their new tails. Their anal opening was another hand span lower, but on the same side as their genitalia. There didn't seem to be the same sensitivities to that repositioned opening has had existed previously, but their new sexual organs more than made up for that lack. She could feel her new, slightly larger, clit swell with blood as she continued to stroke her own breasts.

"We're supposed to be listening," John murmured.

"Everyone is out and about collecting stuff for tomorrow's feast," Danni countered, turning on her side and rolling into his embrace. "We can listen and nuzzle."

"Nuzzle?" asked John as he felt Danni's hand reach down his tail to stroke along the sides of his vent. The blood rushed quickly to his penis, and he quickly pulled on his vent muscle to release his now growing cock into the dim light of the cave, now getting brighter as their sexual overtures caused their bio-chemical luminescence to grow. As he looked down at their entwined tails, he thought that it looked a little bit like those posters from the late sixties and early seventies: a funky UV black-light show as their tails flashed color and light into this small space.

As Danni stroked John's fish-flanks, she marveled at how silky smooth he felt, both in his tail and in upper torso and hair. She remembered Pat's explanation that their new skin, scales, and hair were actually covered with millions of tiny ridges, micronodules, that made their bodies hydrophobic, which Danni thought was a funny word to use for mermaids. She would never be the science student Pat wanted her to be. What Danni cared about was how incredibly smooth and soft their skin felt, like the purest silk, and this smoothness seemed to enhance their own sense of touch and of being touched, because their entire body was covered with these micronodules, tiny nanostructures that helped them slide through the water. Danni wondered if those same micronodules covered John's rising cock.

"Ouungh," John sighed as he felt Danni's hand grasp his stiffening cock by the base and give it a tug.

Yes, they did. Good. Danni loved the way his cock felt in her hand, so thick, and strong, filling with blood, throbbing in her grasp, and yet so incredibly soft and smooth, like a silk lollipop. She lifted herself forward, bending at her pelvis, and gave his cock a lick. She giggled as John twitched, a bit of pre-cum visible at the tip of his large cock. She pointed it vertically, marveling at its length, as she waved it back and forth in the air. It stuck nearly fourteen inches into the air. She didn't understand how it all fit inside her. She remembered her own penis, from long ago before she changed, and was once again grateful for all her own changes. She pointed John's back at her mouth, and slowly let the first six inches slide past her lips.

Her left nipple brushed against John's hard stomach, and suddenly Danni knew why she wanted to be dry. Her wonderful breasts were dangling, not floating, and she loved the way that felt. She could feel John's hands on her back, stroking her narrow waist, the swell of her hips, stroking the strong muscles of her tail where it joined her body. He ran his hands along her dorsal membrane, and once again she was assailed by the new feelings of wonder and sensuality that her tail created in her. She hunched her back into his caresses even as she pushed her breasts into John's stomach and sucked on his cock with vigor. John pushed his groin into her attentions, and lifted both of them into the air.

"No yet," Danni breathed, her own breath now ragged with passion. "I want this cock somewhere else."

She rolled herself onto her lover, and felt his long cock trapped between them, reaching all the way to her belly button. She put one hand on each of his shoulders, holding herself above him, her golden hair cascading around her, her breasts dangling freely even as they began to tighten with her growing milk. She flexed her flukes and tail and lifted her body above him, holding herself with her hands and flukes over him.

"Put it in," she begged, "help me put it in."

John reached down and grabbed his stiff cock and aimed it towards her now dripping pussy, which was now a smooth pair of silken folds, normally invisible but now swollen and open, pulsing in her shimmering, beautiful tail. He looked with wonder at the beautiful creature suspended over him. Danni's multicolored blue eyes were sparkling with passion; her full lips were relaxed and parted as she concentrated on moving her body over John's cock. Her full breasts with their long nipples dangled and swayed above him as her golden body undulated sinuously, back and forth, trying to impale herself on his stiff mast. Her golden tail shimmered and sparkled as tendrils of light shot up from her flukes. It was the most erotic thing he had ever seen. He gasped as he felt her white-hot heat settle onto him, surrounding him, making him forget that his gills and dorsal membrane were now being pressed into the rocky cave floor by two bodies, not one.

"Finally," Danni hissed as she arched her back, marveling at her own flexibility as she raised her torso vertically above him, his cock rising through her body ramrod straight as she ground herself down into her lover, their tails pressing into each others, rustling like satin sheets. John grabbed Danni's generous hips and helped her raise and lower her fiery pussy onto him, and he watched the wild gyrations of her breasts as her efforts grew in intensity. She grabbed his wrists, and together they worked so that Danni could flex both her tail and her arms to lift herself up and down on his marvelous cock.

The angle of penetration was pushing his cock forward so that it dug into her G-spot with each pass. Danni's passion rose quickly, like a tornado, fed by the wonderful feelings of her breasts swelling, bouncing, and shaking as she pounded herself into his body, again and again. She could feel her own hair tickling her gills, her interior muscles pulling and tugging at John's long cock. Suddenly she froze, holding only the crown of John's cock inside her hot, and wet pussy, savoring the way he stretched her open. Her arms were shaking with effort as she held off her orgasm, her eyes screwed shut, her breath held.

"Come on, you tease," groaned John as he lifted his hips into her.

"No ... ah ... wait ... ohhh ... just a ... uuuungh ... sec," Danni begged, quivering on the edge. Then, "AAAAAHHHHHHH," she cried as she slammed herself back down on his cock, taking him to the hilt. Her orgasm hit her like a sledgehammer, squeezing John almost painfully. Milk poured from her breasts, and John felt the warm sweet rainfall covering his face and chest. Then he felt a great release of liquid drench his cock and tail as Danni squirted in her great passion. The feeling of hot liquid rolling off his tail sent him over the edge, and he erupted into her, groaning with delight, both of their tails rustling in the air of the cave as they shook in passion and release.

Now, that was worth trying again, thought John as he watched the lights swirl in their tails. Danni collapsed into his chest, her hair spilling over them, her breasts slick with milk sliding on his own chest. Yes, it was messy he thought as he licked some milk from his lips where Danni had rained down on him, but definitely worth trying again. After all, they only had to roll into the water to clean off. John savored the fading tremors in his tail and slowed his breathing, stroking Danni's hair as she continued to twitch and whimper into his chest for several minutes.

Then they heard two faint, distant, and brief thumps, followed by equally faint, distant, and brief screams of the three men in the caves as the triplet's barbs sank into their bodies.

The men were terrified when they saw the three strange, large, brightly colored blue and white fish moving towards them along the rocky bottom of the cave in which they were trapped. They were chest deep in the roiling water, the occasional wave reaching all the way to the back of the cave, dousing their heads. In their unthinking panic, one man lowered his arm underwater towards the approaching fish, aiming his nine-millimeter gun at the long, undulating shapes, and fired a single shot at the approaching forms.

The report was loud, but the bullet bounced harmlessly from Emma's side. Pat had been right; a bullet fired underwater isn't lethal beyond one meter. Another gang member lowered the AK-47 he had been holding above his head and the gun jammed after only one round, and that bullet too had only traveled about two meters. The third man never had the chance to get a shot off, as the triplets charged and caught each man cleanly in the abdomen or leg. Mu Su, Xing, and Phoebe, who had hung back to give the smaller triplets enough room to maneuver for their strikes, then rushed forward and grabbed each paralyzed man by their feet, and together, all six merfolk pulled them back out into the sea.

Each man's eyes flared first in fear and then in desire as they saw the strange and wondrous creatures that held them in the water. Their eyes flickered in confusion, however, as each man slowly realized that he could not move. Then, the subtle lines and creases of a paralyzed human face began to clench in terror as they realized they were going to have to breathe soon, and these beautiful creatures that surrounded them, waiting and watching, had faces full of purpose and grim determination. Their faces were both beautiful and terrifying, thought Pat as she moved towards Phoebe. Phoebe shook her head, a grim look in her eye, and turned to Rikki, floating next to her, whose venom was now coursing through the terrified man's body.

"For my mother and father, the Henderson's," Rikki whispered into the dying man's ear.

His eyes flashed in fearful recognition and renewed terror, but Rikki and Phoebe held him gently, effortlessly, their eyes fixed on his, until his breath-hold breakpoint was reached, and he breathed in a lungful of water. There was no violent laryngospasm, as Pat had predicted, their venom prevented this normal effort to keep water from reaching the lungs. Mu Su and Cleo, and Xing and Emma held their men as well, while Cleo and Emma whispered the same message, watching their former tormentors, rapists, and thugs aspirate water, fear and loathing burning in their eyes until the last whisper of life faded from them.

It was a remarkably gentle death.

Pat checked each man for a pulse, and when she was sure that each of them was dead, she nodded. All of them formed a school around the dead men, and swam them out towards the drop-off, where they knew there would be sharks. A few strokes with a utility knife, and they would let the ocean do the rest.

They returned to the cave, and Rikki and Cleo gathered the fallen guns, while Emma picked up the backpack one of them had abandoned earlier. Mu Su, Xing, and Phoebe gathered their net-bags, and they headed back for the western caves.

It had been a good morning's work.

Petra, Gail, and Michael burst through the Moon Pool and shot up into the air, the three of them forming a mermaid fountain of light, color, and laughter. They arced up into the large cavern, feeling the noonday sunshine down from the chimney high above. Each of them reached backwards and grabbed their flukes, somersaulting back into the water below. They sliced cleanly into the water, only Petra making any splash on her reentry, her breasts too much to compensate for. Giggling they resurfaced, giddy with their good news.

They immediately sensed a different energy between the other two pods that were lounging on the cave floor.

"What's up?" asked Gail as she pushed herself up onto the cave floor, water rolling off her face, hair, and breasts.

"Three down, fourteen to go," said Phoebe with a small, tight smile.

"Five down, twelve to go," said Petra as she lifted herself next to Gail, her lavender tail twisting in the water as she gracefully settled herself on the ledge next to her pod-mate. Well, she was looked graceful until you noticed that her generous breasts still bobbled and rose for several seconds after she had settled into her seat.

"You got two," asked Pat eagerly, "which ones?"

"We didn't get two," Gail explained. "We talked to two, Angara and her lover, Saya."

"They speak English?" Mu Su exclaimed. "I never heard them talk English."

"Well," Pat asked impatiently, "what happened?"

"You first," Gail demanded. "You actually killed someone?" she finished with a hungry look in her eye.

"I didn't kill anyone," Pat explained, "they did," indicating Mu Su and his pod with one hand and Phoebe and Xing with the other.

"Xing!" Gail exclaimed, grabbing her newest sister-wife into a fierce hug, "you got one?"

"Yes," Xing said, "Cleo sting him; I hold him under."

"You're alright?" Petra asked anxiously, taking Xing from Gail's embrace and examining her carefully, lifting her arms one at a time, spinning her torso around, looking like a camp councilor getting a young camper ready for a shower.

"I fine, Mom," Xing teased, giving her a kiss to soften the dig. "Pat say our venom make gentle death."

Phoebe brought everyone up to date on how their venom worked and how the men had drowned, what they did with the bodies, and the weapons that they had collected and others that they found in the backpack. The guns that had been used underwater would probably still work, but Gail stopped their story and their speculation for a "land battle" that Mu Su seemed to be hoping for as he showed off the nine millimeter.

"We have a better idea," she said. "Tomorrow night will be a luau on the beach, and Angara and Saya will help us plan for a very special evening."

"Are you sure we can trust them?" Pat asked.

"I trust them," Cleo said. "They never harmed us, and they sometimes seemed genuinely sorry for what was happening to us."

"She's right," Emma added. "I always felt they secretly resented Alberto, but did not have a way out."

"It was only because Alberto never said anything about their relationship that they even stayed with him," Rikki explained. "Lesbians are not usually visible or welcome in Filipino culture."

"We heard them talking about the luau earlier this morning," John reported, giving Danni a smile. "So they are least telling the truth about that."

"Hey, I know that smile," Phoebe teased, "are you sure you two were concentrating on listening?"

"You'll have yours shortly, you minx!" John promised. "Now, what's the plan?"

Well, at least these three deaths were explainable, Alberto thought as he and his men picked through the remains of two of his men that had washed ashore along one of the small beaches that dotted the eastern side of the island. The sharks had ripped off most of their limbs and tore large chunks from their torsos. Only one of his men was still recognizable, but it was enough.

Why had they been stupid enough to go down to the water, he wondered. They were supposed to be gathering fruit, nuts, and small game for the luau tomorrow. He stood on the beach for a few minutes, the afternoon sun behind him, scanning the horizon. He was down to eleven men, and his cousin and her lover. Well, it was fewer to feed, and there was only one person he was worried about getting off this island. Himself. He ordered his men to leave the bodies to rot on the beach, and headed back into the jungle.

Maybe they should dive down to the boats and see if any of the equipment could be salvaged. They had seen no new activity in the lagoon, found no evidence of anyone else living on the island, and he now new that the sharks were over here on the eastern shore. Yes, after they had the luau, they would reclaim the beach huts and begin plans to get off this godforsaken chunk of lava.

Twenty-four hours later, twelve merfolk huddled together in the large sand bowl in the middle of the lagoon, several hundred yards from the beach. They had worked hard all day, starting by meeting with Angara early in the morning, before sunrise, to help her with a special recipe for the evening's meal, and then spent the morning herding fish towards the men's fishing tackle so that the lagoon would be especially bountiful. Now, all they could do was wait.

Now, as the sun began its journey towards the far western horizon, they knew it had worked. The men were laughing, playing in the surf, and feeling like the curse that had laid over them was finally being lifted. Angara and Saya had outdone themselves, preparing a feast of seafood, fruits, berries, and even some left over canned goods from their stores from the boats. No one noticed anything different about the fruit punch because it was the first time that they had ever made any. If they had made some earlier, they might have noticed a slight metallic taste to this batch, the result of the addition of a touch of mermaid venom.

No, they just assumed it was the quality of the still, or how long it had been since they were drunk. They drank it all down, without noticing anything. As the sun neared the horizon, everyone was settling down in the huts, fat, full, and inebriated. Soon, however, the whisper dose of venom that Angara had added to the breadfruit and to the punch began to work on their bodies. Soon they were all asleep, even more than asleep, because when Saya fired three times into the sky, no one moved.

Well, the last shot she fired wasn't into the sky, and Angara couldn't blame her when it blasted through one of Alberto's men instead, the one who had beaten and raped her a few months ago, before Alberto put a stop to it because he wanted his own meals cooked and prepared by women who could still hold pots. After all, Saya, who was a forty-three year-old virgin until that awful moment, deserved to get her revenge. She was only a little bit sorry that he was asleep when she shot him, but only a little.

As the merfolk emerged from the water, Angara then enjoyed watching Saya as she saw all three pods for the first time, not just Gail's beautiful face and shoulders in the water. Angara had been surprised when all twelve merfolk ambled up onto her beach in the early morning light, but she was pretty sure Saya didn't quite understand who their new allies actually were. Saya's reaction had proven that she was right, as she was stunned. But she quickly recovered and told Angara that she had never seen anything more beautiful in her life. Together, humans and merfolk, they worked quickly, and soon the remaining eleven men were bound and tied on the beach.

"They no muerto?," asked Angara in her broken Spanglish.

"No, they're just unconscious," Pat reported, checking on one of the men. "We didn't give them enough to make their hearts stop beating. We would have to give each of them two full strikes directly."

"They be muerto pronto," Angara stated, smiling.

"Are you sure you want all of them dead?" Pat asked.

"Si, dead," Saya agreed.

"Angara, did you explain to her how our numbers worked?" asked Petra.

"No, Siento," she apologized.

Pat had them sit down next to her on the beach as she carefully went through each pod, explaining how each of them had come to be. As she pointed to the colorful pods who had gathered into their family units, Angara translated for Saya, who's English was not very good. As their understanding grew, the eyes of the two women grew wide with amazement. When Pat explained how the mermaids had very high social needs, and that if there were no men in a pod, one of them would probably change into a male, the two women broke into feverish Spanish. After a few moments, they seemed to have reached an agreement.

"Me hago un hombre?" Saya stated.

Angara explained that Saya could never accept the attention of a male, but that she would be willing to become one to keep her lover as her mate.

"You want to become the man?" asked Pat carefully, pointing to John for reference.

"¿Sí, quiero hacerme como él?" Saya corrected, pointing at Michael and Mu Su.

"Right," Pat said, seeing that Saya really did understand how those mermen had come to be-both former girls-like she would become.

"Is there anyone here who you would consider making a female member of your new pod?" Phoebe asked. "Just the two of you might be difficult, and three or even four of you would be better."

The two women broke into more Spanish, and after a few moments, Angara walked over to one of the younger members of the gang, and rolled him over onto his back. He was a Filipino male, about twenty-five years old. Lakan, was his name, Angara explained, and he was just a kid who got recruited by Alberto some years back, and he never seemed to have the taste for cruelty that most of the others did. No others, however, would even be considered. They were animals ... worse than animals, because they tortured their own for mere pleasure.

With that settled, the former victims of Alberto and his gang, except for Danni, took the remaining gang members unconscious bodies down to the water for an evening swim, except for Alberto and Lakan. The men helped the women drag the bodies to the water, and then each mermaid and merman took an unconscious man into the surf. An hour later, Pat, Danni, and John watched as everyone else returned to the lagoon, empty handed. No one said a word, but there was a fierce satisfaction in everyone's eyes.

Everyone returned to the fire Saya had kept going, and waited for Alberto and Lakan to wake up.

His head was pounding, his ears were ringing, and he was vaguely conscious of his hands being tied behind his back. He blinked, and thought he saw a fire, but surrounding the fire were thousands of jewels, sparkling with color and inner light. He struggled towards consciousness, and soon he was able to focus his eyes. At first, he was tempted to sit up in shock, but he had made it this far in a dangerous life by being careful, so he didn't stir. It took inhuman effort to do so, but he kept his eyes to mere slits as he took in the unbelievable sight before him.

There, assembled around the fire, were mermaids and mermen! He counted his breaths and pushed his limbs against the cords so he could feel the bindings cut into him, causing pain to course up his arms and legs. Yes, he was awake, and yes, those were mermaids. That blonde one, with the blue scales and webs sitting next to the steel-gray merman, yes, she was the one in the water a few weeks ago, and he must have been the shark. Alberto cursed himself for not having seen through that charade, even as he still tried to absorb the existence of creatures out of myth and fantasy.

None of his men were visible, but his cousin and her ugly lover were sitting among the mermaids, chatting and listening as the group talked. He could see the two Henderson girls, and he thought he recognized that Australian brat, but where was her uncle? And there was a third Henderson girl! What? He tried to figure out who all these people/mermaids were, and he only grew more confused. How had they come here, how did the Henderson girls go from two to three? And there was one of the Chinese girls, Shou something, but where was that bitch, Mai Lin?

As he listened to their conversations, trying to figure out who was who and what was what, Alberto slowly realized that everyone was talking about the people in their lives that he or his men had killed, and that he had woken up as they were mourning the loss of loved ones. This was not a good time to let them know that he was now awake, and he had no illusions as to what they had planned for him. He felt with his arms for the small hard bump sewn into the rear of his pants, and when his wrists found the hard edge of his hidden derringer, he almost cried with relief. He didn't know where his men were, but he suspected that they were all dead.

No, wait. He could see young Lakan lying near Angara. Perhaps not all was lost. If he could survive this crisis, then he could see about getting rescued before his own boss tracked him down. The thought of explaining all this to his boss, Malaki, a man even more ruthless than he was, made his blood run cold. Without his boats, his records, and his passwords, Alberto's own skimming would become visible, and Malaki would kill him for the millions he had kept for himself. First, he had to survive, and to that end, he silently worked on the ropes around his wrists.

"And so, I will miss them always," Emma sobbed, "but even more so because they will never know how happy I am now."

Rikki and Cleo leaned into their sister as Mu Su gathered his strong arms around all three of them. He held them all quietly, the rest of the pods watching in respectful silence, as the three girls finally mourned their parents. No one said anything more, but just listened to the fire's crackle and the girls' quiet sobs.

It had been a long evening. The evening stars had come out, and the moon was full and bright over the eastern arm of the lagoon. The mermaids could all see quite clearly, their eyes adjusting to the darkness automatically. Gail looked with brittle hatred in her eyes at Alberto where he lay. Suddenly, she noticed that his eyes were actually alert and open behind the carefully held slits to which he had held himself.

"He's awake," she said rising, and going around Michael to reach the recumbent captive.

Several things happened at once, and the moonlight illuminated everything ... every detail ... with an eerie clarity that no one there would ever forget. Alberto pulled one hand from behind his back and pointed a small, shiny weapon at Gail. But Gail didn't back off, and kept coming.

"You've already shot me twice, you sonofabitch," she snarled, "go ahead and try it again."

As she started for him, Michael saw the determination in Alberto's eyes and sprang from his spot beside the fire, lifting his entire body into the air, hurtling towards Gail. At the same moment, John launched himself towards Alberto, arcing over the fire in an impossible display of athleticism. Mu Su tossed aside his girls and launched himself into the air, equally intent on destroying this insect of a man.

In the milliseconds that followed, time seemed to slow down to a crawl. Pat, Danni, and Phoebe screamed in horror as they saw their mate sail towards Alberto's loaded gun. Petra and Xing were frozen in terror as they saw Gail charging even as Michael's leap propelled him forward. The triplets screamed as they rose from the sand where Mu Su had thrown them and watched as his yellow and black stripes flashed in the firelight headed straight for danger. Alberto saw three mermen flying towards him, and Gail charging him on the ground. She was closest. He aimed at her chest and fired.

Before he could aim at a second target, John's barb was in his chest, his body slamming into his, and he before his head hit the sand, he could feel his body going numb. He felt a second sting as Mu Su's barb punctured his thigh, and Mu Su's carefully placed elbow thumped on his chest. That hurt, despite the growing numbness.

Michael's leap had carried him forward, catching Gail's low charge, and dragging her out of harm's way, but as he twisted in the air, protecting his mate, the tiny bullet pierced his spine, ricocheted off his vertebrae, and splintered into his lungs. The pain was excruciating, and he knew he was paralyzed. Worse, he could feel his lungs fill up with blood.

Gail felt Michael go limp as they hit the sand together. And by the time the other mermaids had rushed over to them, she was holding Michael in her arms. She could feel Petra and Xing rush to her side, and she felt a slick warmth oozing between her webbed fingers as she cradled his dorsal ridge.

"Oh, Michael," she whispered, "what have I done?"

"Gail," he struggled, coughing up blood. "You are my warrior, my sister, (cough) ... my lover ... never forget."

"Quick take my milk," urged Petra frantically.

"No, love," Michael whispered, "No time ... this ... more important." His body was wracked with spasms and he coughed up more blood. "I will ... always ... be with you ... all" he whispered, "Petra is pregnant, and you," he held Gail in a fierce gaze," and you ... must be ... be ... the fadthurrrrrrrr." Micheal's eyes fluttered, and then relaxed into an sightless gaze at the stars.

The moment seemed to hang in the air, the sky and stars frozen in place. Even the sea was silent. No one breathed.

"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!" Gail's cry pierced the night, ripped from her chest like a rusty knife. Petra and Xing collapsed on their pod-mate, also wailing, while the rest held their breath in stunned silence.

Many moments passed in mute agony and horror.

Then, Gail slowly laid down her lover's head, now lifeless, and fixed his hair. She had an eerie calm about her. She turned to her wailing sister-wives, and lifted up their chins. She held their eyes, and they choked back their sobs, strengthened by the force of Gail's will, and together they salamandered slowly and deliberately over to where Alberto lay. John and Mu Su backed away slowly as the three mermaids approached, death in their eyes.

Alberto lay conscious but unmoving as he saw the three faces loom over his. If he had been able to move, he would have cowered. As it was, his eyes shone bright with fear.

"Yours will not be a gentle death," Gail said with unnatural calmness.

"Gail," Pat began.

"No!" Gail, Petra, and Xing said together.

"Then here," Pat said as she held out a knife to Gail.

"No, I won't need that," Gail said in her surreal, calm way, and ripped Alberto's pants off his unmoving body with a single pull.

A mermaid's fingernails are surprisingly strong, thought Phoebe as she looked at her own hands as she scoped up the last handful of redstained sand and dropped it into the bucket she had for this purpose. It had taken everyone but Gail, Petra, and Xing the better part of the morning to clean up the mess that Alberto's death had caused. The other pods had watched in horror and understanding as the three grieving pod-mates vented their outrage and vengeance upon the immobile man. It had only taken a few minutes, but Alberto had remained conscious right up to the point when Gail's barbs on her flukes had pierced his skull, slamming down through his eyes as his blood spilled from the stumps of his limbs which had been ripped off with inhuman strength. When they were done, the three exhausted widow-mermaids had dragged the Alberto's pieces into the sea. They wouldn't let anyone else help with their grizzly task.

Phoebe dumped the bucket into the surf, letting the ocean wash away the blood. She looked around at the beach, checking for any further signs of last night's deadly business. She only saw the signs of where each of the two remaining pods had spent the previous evening. It was the first night most of them had spent on dry land for many weeks, and Phoebe was surprised at how comfortable the sand had been, sitting with her pod mates, entwined together in grateful acknowledgement that fate had spared them.

Gail and the others had returned about an hour after they left with Alberto's remains, and they picked up Michael's body. Pat had offered to help, but all three mermaids had simply shaken their heads in silence, and gathered their mate into their arms and returned to the sea. Phoebe had nearly stopped them to ask if they could examine Michael's body, but Pat stopped her.

"This is not a time for science," Pat whispered as the three widowmermaids disappeared into the water.

Both John's and Mu Su's pods had stayed upright on the sand, in a mute salute as the three mermaids struggled with their burden, and they remained there, frozen in their vigil, hours later as the sun came up. No one moved, no one spoke, no one slept, not even Angara and Saya, until Lakan had stirred awake after the sun had lifted itself ten degrees off the horizon.

After Lakan was fully awake, Pat, with Angara translating, explained what his options were, and while he was not looking forward to becoming a woman, or a mermaid, he seemed grateful for the chance to live. He asked who the three missing mermaids were, having never met them, but Angara assured him that "he" would never meet them, but "she" would.

Three days later, they finally returned.

One day before that return, seven mermaids and three mermen floated in the Moon Pool while Lakan sat fearfully in the cave, waiting for his turn. They had started with Saka two days ago, who became Agba in about twelve hours; his new Filipino name meant "courage." Afterwards Angara had made her transition in about ten hours. Now it was his turn. He already had immature gills on his back thanks to the feedings they had given him. He had enjoyed those despite knowing what they were doing to him. Danni's breasts were his favorite, with her classic blonde looks, long nipples, and supple body. He had to be restrained for this morning's feeding because he kept pawing at her body, determined to enjoy his last hours as a man.

Agba rose up as soon as Angara had finished changing. He was a small merman compared to John or Mu Su, but he was large for a Filipino man, over seven feet in length with an impressive silver and black-stripped tail. He had regressed in age as he changed, and appeared to be a healthy man, well ... merman, in his early twenties. He had broad shoulders and a strong jaw. His hair was black as were his eyes, and the look he gave Lakan brokered no negotiations. Lakan merely sighed as he slipped reluctantly into the pool.

He discovered himself facing Angara, who had equally regressed in age, and was beautiful, more beautiful than he could have possible imagined. She had radically changed and was lovely in her shimmering silver-white tail with a whisper of pink along her fins, flukes, and webbing. Her hair was also white, and her eyes were blue, a striking combination. Like Agba, she was small, about the same size as Xing, but she had lovely breasts and a tiny waist. Her dorsal membrane looked like finest lace as it fluttered in the water behind her. She was finishing a squid, as everyone was eating after her transition in the pool, rather than above in the cave. She swallowed the last of her meal, and he gulped as she reached out her arms for him.

The entire group intoned, "Liga take from Angara her milk and receive from her your tail." Liga was to be his new name, which meant "light," and they were speaking because they knew he would refuse. Even as he felt Angara's arms cradle his head to her breast, and even as his lips began drinking from her, he still felt a great turmoil inside; he would not will this to happen. They would have to force him.

Pat had known Lakan would go down fighting, and so when Angara had finished, before Agba had risen to fetch him, she had coached everyone on what to do. They would will him to change. Agba wanted Liga to become a black mermaid to Angara's white, and everyone agreed on what Liga would look like, and more importantly, how the future mermaid should behave. She would be a devoted mate to Agba and sister-wife to Angara. Pat also enjoyed the pun buried in Lakan's new name, he would be black in color, but light hearted in nature-if this experiment worked.

Lakan felt the energy build slightly from Angara's milk, and he struggled as Angara guided him towards Pat. He could hear them all humming.

"Liga, take from Pat her milk and receive from her your tail," they all chanted.

Pat took the reluctant man to her breast, and he could not stop himself from suckling at her large nipples. Pat focused her mind, even as she felt the customary pleasure >from a feeding flow through her body, on feminine thoughts, and reveling in the feelings of a female body, the wonder of erogenous zones that encompass whole areas of a body, rather than centered in a penis. She felt the milk flow from her breasts, and thought of the joy she felt when she finally accepted her journey into womanhood. She switched breasts, and renewed her focus on Liga becoming a beautiful mermaid, deeply bonded to Agba and Angara. She could feel his resistance, but it faded some as she focused her will upon him. When he had drained her breasts, she pushed him to Danni.

Lakan could feel the forces building, and he was trying to fight them. He couldn't stop himself from drinking, however, and he knew that each drop was pushing him further and further away from manhood and deeper and deeper into a new world that he feared. He could not shut out their humming, their energy, or their will.

"Liga, take from Danni her milk and receive from her your tail," they repeated.

Lakan was almost eager to return to Danni's wonderful breasts, but he did not reach for her. Instead, she gathered him into her arms, and guided his trembling lips to her nipples. She too focused on the great joy she had discovered when she changed from man to woman, and then again from woman to mermaid. She poured those thoughts into the milk that flowed from her breasts into the slender man she held.

Lakan could feel his body growing rigid, his legs stiffening towards the bottom of the pool. How could that be, he wondered. They told him he would first become a woman and then become a mermaid. He fought against the forces that seemed to be both within his body and surrounding him in the water, pressing in on him from all sides, but his body would not respond to his own will. He could feel pressure at his waist and shoulders pushing in, and pressure at his hips pushing out. Even as he reluctantly continued to drink from Danni's breasts, his body began its journey towards womanhood.

"Liga, take from John his semen and receive from him your tail," the group chanted as they pushed him towards the enormous merman, whose equally large cock stood stiff in the water, pointed at his face.

Lakan turned away, but Danni and Pat held his arms and Angara held his legs, and moved him towards John's body. He turned his head from side to side, but that only succeeded in making John's penis slap his face and brush against his lips. A drop of pre-cum caught his lips on his second pass, and the taste froze him in the water. Pat reached up and opened his mouth with her fingers as John slowly inserted his cock into the reluctant transformee's mouth. As soon as John's cock reached the back of his throat, a great spurt of semen gushed forth, and Lakan's gag reflex took over, and he swallowed down the load. Another spurt followed, and Lakan took that one down, and another, and another. Finally, the mermaids stopped holding him, and he floated free from John's cock, horrified at what was happening to him.

"Liga, take from Rikki her milk and receive from her your tail," the group repeated as Angara, still holding Lakan's legs, moved him to her. Rikki took the now trance-like Lakan to her lips, noting that he was already well on his way to womanhood. His slender torso had become more so, and his hips had widened considerably. His hair was longer, and his face was softer. His hands and shoulders were dramatically smaller, and his eyes were larger. He drank from her deeply.

"Liga, take from Cleo her milk, and receive from her your tail," they said. He wanted to turn away, but he could not. He drank from Cleo's breasts, no different from Rikki's, and felt his manhood slip further and further away. He was now mostly a woman, he could tell. But they would never get his mind, he vowed.

"Liga, take from Emma her milk, and receive from her your tail," they chanted and then resumed their humming. There was something different about Emma's breasts, and he found himself sucked into an energy he had not felt before. Emma focused her mind clearly on her own very recent journey into womanhood, and thrilled to the incredible feelings that washed over her as she was a feeder for the first time. She poured her love of all things girlish into her milk, into Lakan, and she pressed her whole body into his increasingly female body. Pat had joined Angara at Lakan's legs, and his body was now visibly feminine.

"You love breasts, don't you?" Emma whispered to the increasingly feminine Lakan who nodded wordlessly into her breast, still sucking at her nipple. "Come on Liga, let me see your breasts," she urged. "Push out, you can do it, nice breasts with pert sensitive nipples. You want breasts, you know you do."

Liga couldn't help it. She did want breasts, and so she pushed. It felt incredible; her breasts slowly rose on her chest even as she switched to Emma's other breast. She could feel her nipples expand into the water, crinkling up with tension as they grew, a delicious itching deep within her chest.

"Liga, take from Mu Su his semen and take from him your tail," they chanted again. Liga could feel her legs stiffening further as Pat and Angara rubbed her long, slender limbs, so soft and feminine. She reached forward with her own hand, and guided Mu Su's cock to her mouth, and swallowed each spurt as it flowed into her body. The energy was really building now, and she could feel with swirling forces within and without her body.

"Liga, take from Agba his semen and take from him your tail," they sang a final time.

"Yes, Agba ... give me my tail," Liga gasped, filled with sudden need and barely able to contain herself.

She fell on to Agba's cock and pulled deeply on it. She was instantly rewarded with hot rush of semen that gushed into her mouth. Another, and another, and another! She sucked harder, and was rewarded with another, and yet another. Agba arched in his orgasm, and focused on Liga's journey towards his future pod-mate.

Liga pulled back as Pat and Angara floated away from her legs. Her arms seemed to be pulled by a force outside herself, stretching out horizontally in the water, her head erect, her toes rigidly pointed towards the bottom of the pool. She could feel her dramatically changed body in the water, the cool caress of water on her neck, her breasts, her tummy, her hips, her crotch, and her rigid legs. She hung there for all time and no time at all. The water she could feel lapping at her crotch, caressing her thighs, began to feel warm, and she pushed down on her crotch with her stomach muscles, clenching her back as well in her effort to push down her crotch.

The others watched as Liga moaned into the water, her body pulsing with energy, as the familiar slow-motion spasm rolled through her body. They were all humming in unison, watching her slowly transform into a beautiful mermaid. Her legs fused, and then her tail lengthened. Her flukes then appeared, and then her fins and dorsal membrane, and finally her webbing and her final growth of hair signified that the two and one half days were nearly finished.

Liga could not feel time pass, but she felt a growing urge rise within her. She pushed hard, her whole body caught up in the incredible effort, and felt her tail reach for the bottom of the pool. She could feel the strange and painful sensation of her bones breaking, reforming, and knitting themselves back together. Even as she recovered from that ordeal, she could feel her flukes push out from her tail, and then her fins at her sides. Long, sinewy muscles formed and attached themselves to her pelvis, torso, and tail. She could feel her tail forming scales, crawling down from her waist, cascading over her flanks, and spreading out over her flukes. Waves of energy crashed up and down her body, reshaping and reforming her into a petite, lovely mermaid.

Then a great bubble of energy rose up from her new womb and percolated through her body, rising finally through her head and scalp. She arched her body in a spasm of ecstasy, and when she opened her eyes, she could see her beautiful tailfin fluttering in the afternoon sunlight that filtered down into the Moon Pool.

She straightened out, and looked down at herself. She was beautiful. She had velvet black scales with hints of purple and blue shimmering below the surface, and her fins, flukes, and webbing were trimmed with a delicate white lace. She turned and admired the sweep of her hips out from her waist, and the long fluttering white of her dorsal membrane.

She turned to see Agba and Angara floating before her, and a deep feeling of love and lust welled up from within her. She darted forward in the water, and the three of them were quickly caught in a swirling tangle of fins, tails, and arms. Never before had she felt such need, and she begged Agba to fulfill her need, uncaring of the other pods still in the pool. She remembered her past, but now it seemed distasteful, and the wondrous gift of a new life, a fresh start, with a supple and beautiful body was not to be denied.

Nothing had ever felt like this need, and Liga reached down to Agba's already stiff cock, and pointed it at her virgin opening. She turned to Angara and kissed her deeply as she felt Agba begin to push slowly into her, his penis pushing past her outer lips, silky soft even as they stretched in a wonderful tension around his invading cock. She felt his head glide past her birth canal, sliding up and in, steadily pushing relentlessly forward. She could feel the veins along the outside of his cock as it pushed into her now willing and eager body. Her virginity gave way with barely a ripple, and still his cock pushed inwards.

As his hips met her own, Liga could feel the full length and strength of her husband-pod-mate's cock. His tail was pushed into her own, her labia stretched taught around his thick cock, her clitoris throbbing as his top ridge on his vent poked at it. He slowly pulled his cock back out, pausing at the top of his stroke, holding just the tip of his cock inside her hot and eager pussy.

Then Agba began to stroke in and out of her vagina, his hands at her hips, drawing him into her again and again. She didn't notice as the other pods fell into their own groups, seeking the healing and sanctuary of their own mates. Liga only knew her pod-mates, Angara stroking and pinching her nipples, Agba's cock sawing in and out of her new opening, and that fullness that stretched her insides in a pleasurably agonizing way. When she found her release, seconds later, she passed out in delirium.

Gail looked around her at the circle of mermaids floating in the Moon Pool, and she steeled herself to the task she knew she must do. Petra was pregnant, as everyone had discovered. Her electrical pattern had changed infinitesimally, and when they thought about it, they had agreed that she was now five days late on her period. Gail had been right, she acknowledged silently to herself, Petra was the first to conceive. Now, Gail must become the father.

She had spent the three days in mourning over the loss of their beloved Michael, but the urge to change had built up steadily from her two sister-wives. She recognized their need, and they had returned to the group to affect the quickest change possible, and surprisingly, she had been able to eat large amounts of food for the last few hours, and everyone had joined in the effort to fill her with the raw materials she would need for the change. As the sun set, and the moon rose over their chimney, she hoped that she was ready for her final transformation.

She floated to Xing, who was still trying to control her emotions, but was crying, despite her best efforts. Strange, Gail thought as she looked at the beautiful young Asian mermaid, you can still see tears underwater.

"Xing, my beautiful flower of the sea," she began, "will you give me your milk so that I can become your mate?"

"Oh, Gail," Xing sobbed, "thank you much become Gabriel," using the name Gail had decided to use. "Take me so you give me child."

Gabriel, yes, Gabriel sounded good, she/he thought to himself as he/she heard it spoken for the first time. Gabriel floated forward and took the delicate Xing into his/her arms and kissed her first, then sank to her breast and began to drink. Gabriel drank deeply from her/his podmate, draining her, and then moved to Pat.

"I must drink from you so that I may join John as a male," she/he intoned, "will you help me become a man?"

"Come, Gabriel," Pat said with great gentleness and admiration, "drink from me."

Gabriel could feel the great power in Pat's breasts begin to build the energy she/he would need to make the transition, but she/he held it in check. Gabriel then drank from Danni, Phoebe, Angara, Liga, and then the triplets, each time building power but each time holding those forces in check with her/his indomitable will.

Finally, filled with the energy of the mermaids, and feeling the distant masculine energy of John, Mu Su, and Agba as they waited above, Gabriel/Gail faced Petra, unchanged other than the tremendous energy that she/he held within his/her body.

"I am ... unchanged ... until I come to you ... my love," Gabriel struggled to get the words out in Gail's still unchanged voice. "You were my ... first ... true ... love, and so you will ... remain ... forever. Let me drink from you ... and become ... the man of your dreams."

"Oh, Gabriel," Petra gasped, touched by the gesture and the effort that Gail was exerting to hold back those forces she could see surging within her/his body. "Drink from me my love, and be ours," she said as she looked at the still crying Xing. As Gabriel drifted towards one of Petra's generous breasts, Petra pulled Xing to her other breast. "Drink too, my love," she whispered to Xing, "drink and be healed."

Gabriel and Xing made contact with Petra's breasts at the same moment, and both women arched into enormous orgasms. Xing drank the warmth and sweetness the poured from Petra as she felt the energy that Gabriel had stored and was now releasing throughout his body.

Gabriel could sense the crystal clear image in Petra's mind, and he liberated the forces that swirled within him. He felt his body push outward in all directions throughout his body as his change converted the bulk and food he had stuffed himself with into more bone, muscle, and sinew. He felt his shoulders stretch out, and his arms lengthen, even as his tail grew longer and stronger, and a dorsal fin pushed outward from his backside. Without stopping his efforts at pulling the transformative milk from Petra's breasts, he pushed hard with his abdomen, and he felt his womb fall deep within his tail, tingling and transforming. After a few moments, he felt a new force rising up through his tail, poking out his now changed vent, and then rising into the water. He could feel his new cock, stiff and hot in the cool water, throbbing with need. But still he pulled from Petra's breast.

The rest of the mermaids watched in wonder as Gabriel's tail darkened to the same obsidian black with silver highlights that Michael had once had, and how Gail's stark beauty was changed into a subtle reflection of Michael's rugged good looks. His hair didn't change, but Pat suspected that it would eventually slough off and become shorter like John's and Mu Su's. His eyes, however, were still the vibrant, dark, violet eyes of Gail, darkened now by grief and effort. Gabriel also looked a little gaunt as he finished his change, probably because of the need for his body to add more bulk to the larger bones and muscles he had just created.

Gabriel's change had taken only a few minutes, but for Gabriel it seemed only a few seconds. Now he floated with his two pod mates while John's, Mu Su's, and Agba's pods each found release in their own corners of the Moon Pool. He was now nearly as tall as John, and he looked at the lush, womanly Petra with great love and great sadness.

"He knew before you did," he whispered.

"I don't know why I didn't know that I was pregnant," Petra wondered.

"It because you not born woman," Xing said. "You have few periods. You no could know," she said as she rested her hand on Petra's belly.

"Her name will be ... Michelle," Petra said, holding Xing's hand on her belly while reaching out to bring Gabriel into a kiss. Xing stroked Petra's hair as Gabriel kissed Petra. Petra's kisses became more urgent, and she began pulling at Gabriel's body, pushing herself to him.

"Shouldn't we be careful with the baby," Gabriel worried.

"No," Petra panted into his ear, "this is more important."

Gabriel's heart wrenched as he heard Michael's last words repeated, but he understood what Petra meant. And she was right, this was more important. He gave himself over to the rising blood in his cock, pulled his vent open, and let his new mast rise in the water.

"Oh, Gabriel," Petra moaned as she felt his cock brush against her belly, "I want you so badly."

Xing helped guide his cock to Petra's eager vent, and then wrapped her own tail around her pod-mates as they began to make love. Gabriel now understood why Michael had given himself so easily, so eagerly, and so often to Petra as he felt her welcoming warmth pull his long cock deep within her. He could feel her muscles rippling along his shaft, even as she cooed into his ear, nuzzling him, constantly urging him, "More, more, ... more," in her soft, sweet voice. "Harder, harder, harder," she continued, as his rhythms grew more and more urgent, their bodies slapping together. As Gail, her silence was cold, but as Gabriel his silence was masculine. Nevertheless, he had to tell her how he loved her.

"Petra, oh .... God ... Petra," Gabriel moaned, as his body began to gather sperm deep within his tail, his stiffness reaching down to his mid-tail fins. He could feel Xing perched on his left shoulder, her breasts pressed into his torso as her clit was pressed to his pelvic fin. He could feel his right fin vibrating in the water, and their entwined tails all glittering with their need, shaking and twisting as they made love for the first time as male and female. "Petra ... I ... uh ... love ... oh ... you," he gasped as they pounded into each other.

"Oh, Gabriel ... I ... love ... you ... too ... more ... more .... Again ... right there ... oooohhhh ... more ... my love, AAAAAHHHHHHHHH," Petra murmured as softly as she could into Gabriel's ear as she tried to stifle the volume of her orgasm that ripped through her lush and womanly body, her tail quivering in spasms, her body clenching around Gabriel's stiff cock.

"Arrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhhhhh," Gabriel groaned as his release came, pulsing up from deep within, locking their bodies together in a passionate embrace. As they both quivered in the free-fall tumble of their love, he reached for Petra's beautiful face with his hands, their bodies still twitching, and kissed her deeply. He then turned and kissed Xing who was still coming down from her own orgasm, their bodies surrounded by the milk released from the girls.

"Her name will be Michelle," he whispered again. Both women nodded happily.

### 07 - Sharks, Submarines, and Salvage

The moonlight filtered down from the chimney hole, high above the pool. It glimmered on the surface of the pool that dominated the medium sized cavern at the bottom of the tall chimney room, sending soft sparkles of moonlight bouncing around the rocks and walls. Pat sat, breathing heavily, on the edge of the pool, finishing off a chuck of dried fish as she admired the flashing moonlight reflected from the gently churning pool from which she had just emerged.

She was hungry after her long swim today, the last trek of her two-week trip with John to explore and survey several of the many shipwrecks they had discovered within a few days swim of the island. The two of them had returned only moments ago, and Danni and Phoebe attacked John with a welcome that made it clear that John would be eating later-much later. Pat enjoyed one quick, magnificent, orgasm at John's hip while Danni quivered on John's cock, and Phoebe occupied John's other hip. Now, herself temporarily sated, Pat enjoyed her brief solitude and her late-night meal.

Pat smiled with the recent memory of John's feeble protestations that he was hungry as Phoebe pulled herself onto his still stiff cock. He was silenced by her feverish kisses as she pushed herself onto him. Pat looked at the sparkling surface of the pool, and saw that the entire pool was now clouded by wisps of white that swirled in every corner of the pool, and within denser clouds of white, she could see flashes of color and shapes. Danni and Phoebe's passion had ignited the other pods, and everyone was making love.

Pat gazed up into the moonlight, feeling the cool light as it played along her delicate features, and watched as the gently roiling water cast shimmering reflections of the moon that darted across the high cavern ceiling. She listened to the sound of the water lapping along the edges of the pool and her own flukes as they trailed in the water. She felt her long red hair as it curled along her shoulders, cascaded down her back, and felt one thick lock that fell gently across her left breast. Her body was still quivering from her reunion orgasm, her breasts still tight with milk. She looked down at her body, feeling her own soft thick hair shift along her gills, shoulders, and breast. She gazed along her feminine shoulders and followed the swell of two large mounds that dramatically sloped away from her once male chest, ending at two small domed areolas at the ends of her large breasts, each tipped with a fat nipple that still leaked her mermaid's milk. Even from this angle she thought her breasts were beautiful.

She flicked her stray lock of hair back over her shoulder and swung her shoulders in the sheer joy of being female, feeling her heavy breasts sway and tug at her chest. As her breasts slowly came to a rest, she continued her gaze down to where her flat stomach merged with her shimmering green tail, admiring the sweep of her waist inwards down from her breasts and than back out to the generous swell of her hips. She ran her free hand along her tiny waist, down to the joint between her human and mer halves, teasing herself along that line, tracing the slight texture differences that marked the joining. Her abdomen jerked and twitched, echoing her recent orgasm, as she caressed herself across her tummy. Her whole body felt alive with sensation, even her dorsal ridge that was pressed to the cave floor by her own weight quivered in delightful feelings.

She continued her gentle trickling of her fingertips down along her hips to her pelvic fins, which were really flippers-except that they looked just like her tailfin, shimmering green fins with strong bony ridges that could support her considerable weight, following one of the spines outward to the pink fringe that fluttered along the trailing edge. Her pelvic and mid-tail fins were shaped like traditional dolphin flippers (their pectoral fins), and they felt like little limbs. Pat didn't know what they felt like when she compared her feelings now to her past human memories, both male and female memories. They felt like ... very short arms, she decided as she stroked the length of her pelvic fin. For the next several minutes, she savored the swells of pleasure that still pulsed through her feminine body, the muscles that joined her fins to her body/tail twitching and jumping as she continued her self-stimulation.

Very pretty fins, she thought to herself as she caressed the dusting of pink along the edges, which was matched with similar pink fringes along her dorsal ridge and along the trailing edges of her flukes. Her fringes were all sensitive, and her fin-muscles quivered pleasantly from the sensations her self-caresses caused along the ends of her long, strong fins.

She again marveled at her own new anatomy. Not only was she now a female of the species, but also she was a whole new species. Her three sets of fins/flukes were incredibly tough for appendages that could still sense touch, temperature, and texture. Many times, she caught herself scrambling over rocks, along the sand on the beach, or over the cave floor, worried that her fins would prove fragile. The salamander gait the mers used on land was not nearly as beautiful as their swimming gaits, and Pat smiled as she thought how John always looked like he would damage himself as he launched himself over rocks, sand, scrub trees, and whatever else was in his way. Their fins weren't fragile, however; pelvic, mid-tail, and flukes were all as tough as nails, seemingly impervious to the sharp coral, rough sand, or jagged rocks.

As Pat ran her hands back up along her stomach to her breasts, she thought about how all her skin and scales were durable, especially considering how soft they felt. Ah, the miracle of the Lotus Effect, she thought, remembering her (well, then his) college science courses. Millions of tiny nanostructures made her skin, scales, and even her hair hydrophobic, tough, and yet soft and sensitive to touch at the same time. Her breasts were especially sensitive, she thought to herself as she hefted one in her palm, cradling her heavy breast in her hand.

She marveled yet again at how soft her breasts were, enjoying the ripple of motion across her chest, her nipple stiff and tight in the evening air. She noticed that the milk that was leaking from her distended nipple was not behaving like water did. Her own milk clung to her breast, sliding down her areola, running through her fingers until small drops of milk fell onto her tail. She reached down to the pool, and dribbled some water across the top of her breasts, where it immediately formed little balls that quickly rolled down her cleavage, falling from the side of her round breasts, rather than from underneath, balling up once again when they hit her tail, and rolled off her body onto the cave floor, where it pooled as water normally did, though she could see a thin line of air between her scales and the water that had fallen off her when she rose from the pool. Her milk, however, slowly slid down her tail, and then oozed into the water, creating a wispy trail of white. Her milk was very different from human milk, she surmised, and had molecular properties that made it different than water, which never stayed on her skin or scales for very long. Even now, just moments after leaving the water, her hair that tumbled down her back was dry. Thank goodness they hadn't ended up with a dolphin's fragile skin, she thought to herself. The mix of the original fish goop, Phoebe's rich imagination, and blind luck, apparently, had given them some incredible skills and advantages.

She decided to save that puzzle for another time, and finished the last of her fish. Pat twirled her flukes in the water as she caressed her breasts again, collecting the milk that still oozed from her nipple, and brought it up to her lips to cleanse her pallet. She shivered with pleasure as her hand grazed her swollen nipple, and she squirmed with renewed need as she thought of Danni, Phoebe, and John below, still swirling, still entwined together. She rather enjoyed the fact that not only was Danni and Phoebe frantic to see them again, but also that she was frantic to see her sister-wives too. It was good to be loved. She wondered if she or her sister wives would follow Petra in motherhood, but it wasn't anything she was going to rush into. They had all been having sex nearly constantly, but only Petra had become pregnant thus far. Pat wondered how that was possible.

Well, there was only one way to find out. Pat grabbed another chuck of dried fish, and slipped back into the water. John would get his meal, but he would have to eat and work at the same time. Pat didn't think that he would mind.

The next morning, everyone gathered at the beach by the lagoon after breakfast to hear Pat and John's report.

"We found lots of useful things," Pat began, "most notably a relatively new Russian submarine down at about 300 meters that looks like it sunk recently. We think it is a two-day swim to reach the site, a little over 350 nautical miles to the wreck. There was a crack along the starboard side, which is probably why it sank. We opened the hatch, and there was neutral pressure. We didn't explore much, but it looked like things were intact. The crack along the hull looked like metal fatigue, so we think the reactor is still safe, for now. Wait ... wait ... I know you're all excited, just keep quiet for a sec, and let me finish."

She looked around as everyone settled back down. Although Angara had stopped translating for Agba in the last two months as his skills in English improved, they were now speaking excitedly in Spanish. Angara's white hair and tail sparkled in the morning sun, flashing as she gestured to Agba, her former lesbian lover now merman/pod mate. Agba had grown more and more comfortable in his role as a pod leader, and now matched MuSu in fighting skill. (MuSu had been teaching everyone a version of shaolin kungfu that he had adapting for mer-selfdefense.) Agba's silver and black stripes served as the visual transition from Angara's nearly pure white to Liga's nearly pure black. Liga, who had gained some enhancement of her English as she went through her transformation from a male gang member into their newest mermaid, gave her pod mate a poke to get his attention. Agba turned, arched an eyebrow at Liga who jerked her head towards Pat. Agba smiled a small apology to Pat.

Pat's gaze then turned to MuSu as she noted that both he and Xing had also improved their English skills quickly, so much that they were now practically native speakers. However, like Agba's pod, when excited MuSu and Xing broke into Chinese, but that wasn't a problem because everyone was learning Spanish and Chinese. And in the process, the mers had learned a great deal more about their own capabilities.

All the Mers had discovered that their enhanced mer-senses-their ability to sense the environment and the living organisms around them, their ability to recognize the electrical charges/identities not only of one another but also of all living things, their enhanced hearing and sight both on land and underwater-also seemed to help them learn from one another-new languages, swimming skills, martial arts, etc. Pod mates learned more quickly from one another, which explained why John and Agba's pod could not speak Chinese as fluently as MuSu's and Gabriel's pods (Xing being a native Chinese speaker too), and why all the pods except Agba's could only speak passable Spanish, Peter/Petra having only a modest command of Spanish before her transformation. Pat had nevertheless encouraged everyone to learn all their languages because they could never be sure who among them might make contact with the outside world, though they had all agreed to try and avoid any such contact until they were better prepared.

"I know we have discussed this many times," Pat continued, "but I want to say again that I am against harvesting any kind of weapons."

"And we will repeat," Gabriel said evenly, his violet eyes flashing, "that we must have something to fall back on if we are threatened by humans. We cannot defend ourselves by hiding forever."

"Pat just needed to say that," John interjected. "I know how you feel, Gabriel, and frankly I agree with you." He shot Pat a loving smile, and continued. "When we worked for Greenpeace, we never carried weapons. But, we were just a pain in someone's butt, not a challenge to their entire world view."

"Right," Gabriel said firmly. "I hate to know this the way that I know this ... " Everyone nodded, understanding that he was referring to his former life as a female missionary for a fundamentalist Christian religion. "But ... some people will make it their mission to destroy us, even though we don't threaten them in any way."

"Other than forcing them to re-think everything they thought they knew about the world," Pat said with resignation. "I don't disagree with you, I just can't bring myself to have a weapon, other than the potentially non-lethal one in my tail." It didn't need saying, but everyone was acutely aware that among them all, only Pat could claim to never having killed anyone.

"I won't make a big deal about it," she continued, "but I hope we can find some peaceful way to make our debut into the rest of the world."

"Well, we're not likely to be discovered soon," Rikki offered. "You two were here for ages before any of us came along."

"Actually, that's why we are pretty sure that someone else will be along shortly, because some of our friends know where John and I went, and that we had only planned on spending a year here ... maximum. It's getting close to that now, and so some one will show up," Pat finished.

"If it is a friend," John explained, "we should be o.k. Though I am sure our changes will surprise them," he said with a smile to Pat. "Not only is Pat a girl now, but also we're mers! However, if our first visitor isn't a friend, like say Alberto's boss-what's his name ... " he looked at Emma.

"Malaki," she answered. Emma and her sisters had discovered where Alberto had hidden all his papers on the now destroyed yachts that lay at the bottom of their lagoon. With MuSu's help, they had recovered not only extensive records of his operations but also a large stash of cash that they had carefully dried out in the various caves that riddled the western side of their island. With Agba's pod helping to translate some of the documents, they had only finished going through all the papers just before Pat and John left on their expedition. In fact, the scope and reach of Alberto's crime empire was a major factor that caused Pat and John to seek additional resources that they could use to protect themselves.

"Probably not his real name," Agba offered. "Malaki means "big," and it could be his gang name, not his real one."

"Whatever his name, Alberto owed him some big money, which we now have most of, thanks to the triplets. He won't let those millions vanish without a search," John concluded.

"MuSu helped too," Cleo chimed in, snuggling next to her pod mate on the sand.

"Yes, but you girls discovered where the safe was, and it's a good thing Emma is on our side. She would have made an excellent criminal," Pat teased.

"Between our enhanced hearing and our mer-senses, that safe didn't stand a chance," Emma said dismissively.

"It still takes a keen mind to puzzle it out," Phoebe praised her fellow young scientist. She and Emma were Pat's best students, though Agba was also showing surprising aptitudes despite having been raised a female Filipino with little training and background in science. "So, what is the plan?" Phoebe asked, turning to Pat, her own sister-wife.

"Well, we think we should make an expedition to bring back as much of the equipment and supplies that we found as we can," Pat said.

"All four pods?" asked Gabriel, looking at the still not yet visibly pregnant Petra.

"Everyone," John said. "First, it means that we can carry back more stuff, and second, we will probably be safer that way. With just Pat and I, many larger sharks got curious, more curious than I was comfortable with. Lastly, we can go at different paces, to test our limits and capabilities long before visitors force us to do things we cannot."

It was because they were the youngest.

As part of the experiments that Pat, Phoebe, and now even their own Emma were always creating and doing, MuSu's pod had been "volunteered" to test the limits of their mer-physiology on this trip. Emma herself had volunteered them in "the name of science." Only Cleo was really complaining. MuSu was always ready for anything, especially physical challenges, and Rikki would do anything if it were a dare. Cleo, however, was content to simply be a mermaid, and to not trouble herself with any of the details.

"But Emma," she whined, "I don't like to sweat."

"We're mers," Emma chided. "We don't sweat underwater. We use our dorsal ridge to radiate heat generated from within our bodies into the water."

"Yea, whatever," she continued. "But why ever must you always be poking at me?"

"Because you're just like me, being my exact twin," Emma patiently explained. "I am just trying to understand who we are and what we mers can do. Besides, if you don't complain, I promise to let you have first dibs on MuSu after we get there."

"It's my turn anyway," Cleo said with a shy smile at their pod-mate.

"No, it's Emma's" Rikki interjected.

MuSu gathered Cleo into his arms and gave her a kiss that curled both their tails.

"Alright," she said breathlessly, "I'll stop complaining."

Emma was taking mental notes even as she watched the beauty of her sisters and MuSu as they sliced through the water. In return for not having to carry any supplies on the way to the sub, her pod was given the task of swimming as fast as possible for as long as they could. Everyone else would catch up once they were within sight of the Russian sub. After some experimentation, they discovered that if they swam in a diamond formation with MuSu at the front, two sisters with their heads just behind the tips of his outstretched pelvic fins, and the third sister at the rear of the diamond formation slightly below MuSu's direct wake, the girls could all draft off of MuSu's powerful strokes.

Emma was currently at the back of the diamond, and they were all swimming hard, but she was not expending nearly as much effort as the rest of her pod, because she was drafting off of three vortexes. They also discovered that if they stretched their arms forward, they could leverage their entire bodies into each stroke and that their elbow fins helped stabilize and steer themselves with only the slightest adjustments. Further, if they cupped their hands, they created a bulb of sorts that improved their bodies' hydrodynamic properties, similar to how the big knob at the bow of big ships improves their speed and stability. For the girls, stretching their arms forward had the added benefit of lifting their breasts closer to their chests, making them somewhat more hydrodynamic. It was still thrilling for Emma to feel the water powerfully rushing past her freely swinging breasts.

Their pelvic fins were extended nearly ninety degrees out from their bodies, creating a large flat surface from which their powerful flukes leveraged each up and down stroke of their tails, which allowed their upper bodies to be more relaxed. The short, strong, frequent strokes that created and sustained this high speed were more difficult to keep up than the long, full body strokes they had been used to, but they had been swimming at top speed for over two hours, and while the effort was taking its toll, Emma didn't feel like she needed to slow down yet.

Emma compared her view of MuSu's flashing yellow and black tail with her sisters' blue and white tails. She was surprised by the clear differences between the male and the female stroke. MuSu's shoulders were square to water, his arms forming a powerful V shaped bow. His strong back was visible to her on each down stroke, his dorsal fin fully extended upward, but his head and shoulders stayed at a constant attitude. His tail stroke began in his pelvis and undulated down his tail to his flukes in a single waveform, each stroke a shallow parabola. The girls, however, had much greater movement in their smaller bodies, only their outstretched fists stayed at a constant attitude while their head and shoulders moved as part of each stroke. Their tail strokes started high in their chests, undulating down their bodies in a double waveform, each stroke a sine curve. Emma decided that it was sexy, and while she didn't know it yet, all the Mers had spent many a moment while swimming simply observing their mermaids swim because it was sexy.

Emma imagined that at slower speeds, she could make her body appear even sexier, much like female gaits on dry land could be varied. For now, however, she would simply try to keep swimming fast, and later she could talk with her sisters about how they might drive MuSu to complete distraction. She admired the way that even these unconscious strokes of Rikki's and Cleo's showed off each part of the female mer-anatomy: first the breasts and waist, then the hips and upper tail, then finally the delicate base of their tails and their dramatically decorated flukes. Oh, yes, they could work on making their slow swimming sexy. Yes indeed.

Emma watched as Cleo's dark brown hair fluttered along her back, admiring her sister's beauty and grace, knowing that it was mirrored exactly in her own recently feminized body. As she watched Cleo's body undulate only a few feet from her, she noted that if she wanted to, she could touch each of her pod mates easily, but she would lose some her hydrodynamic properties and they would have to stop this particular experiment-their "as hard and as fast and as long as we can go test." Instead, she let MuSu's wake wash over her and felt herself buoyed by the draft of her powerful pod-mate. She heard the signal from Rikki, a slight vocal pulse in their high, female register, and Emma shifted her stroke in a brief burst of energy to replace Rikki on MuSu's flank while Rikki dropped back to the bottom of the formation.

Stealing a glance at MuSu as she fell into place with her outthrust hands just behind the outermost tip of his extended pelvic fins and her head about even with his mid-tail fins, Emma could tell that her podmate was enjoying the power and exertion, seeking the outer limits of their endurance, and he barely looked winded. He was beautiful, his striped tail flashing, his shorter, darker hair pressed back along his upper shoulders, protecting his upper gills from the sunlight that caressed their bodies as they sped through the water a few meters below the surface. Emma watched the many muscles that rippled in graceful, powerful coordination down MuSu's strong, thick tail, only a few decimeters away from her own fins, and she felt herself become aroused. She wondered if MuSu knew how sexy his muscles were, how much his shining, flashing tail with its dramatic yellow and black stripes, and his lightening yellow highlights along his elbow fins, his dorsal ridge, and his fins and flukes, all turned her on.

It was a good thing they were supposed to be doing this experiment, she thought to herself, otherwise they might be the last pod to reach the submarine. God, she just wanted to eat MuSu up, slide her body against his, press her breasts into his washboard stomach, and suck at his tiny male nipples.

Aaaarrrgggghhhh. Just swim! She yelled at herself silently.

Four hours later, MuSu finally slowed down, his body shaking with fatigue. They surfaced, gulping in the air even as their gills stayed stiff in the water, drinking in the oxygen they craved from both the air and the water. Emma knew that MuSu had expended the most energy, maintaining his lead of the pod, but even so, she herself was glad to stop and rest. After only a few minutes of heavy breathing, their pulses returned to normal, and they began to look around. Emma could see a small atoll a few kilometers further along which she recognized as the half waypoint to the sub from the map Pat had shown her that morning. Emma had a photographic memory, which is why she was the head navigator in her pod.

"MuSu," she said, tapping him on the shoulder as they all relaxed, bobbing in the light surf with their heads above the surface. "There is the atoll that marks the half way point," she pointed ahead of them. MuSu rose on his tail, his pelvic fins above the water, his rippling muscles along his tail and abdomen flexing as he kept his head nearly two meters above the surface of the water. His athletic display reignited a wave of desire that washed through Emma and the other girls like wildfire. As he sank back down, he noticed the lidded eyes of his pod-mates and smiled, enjoying his own sexual power reflected in they eyes of his beautiful trio of identical mermaids.

"How about we stop there for lunch and a bit of fun?" he said with a wink and a leer at the girls. Just as Emma reached for him, he twisted away and headed towards the small island. The girls, giggling, gave chase. This was one of their favorite games, and MuSu easily kept himself just out of reach of the girls. Within minutes, they were all swimming at top speed again, but this time they were leaping and twisting in the water, and if anyone had been looking, they would have sworn that dolphins were at play, except for the visible human parts and the brilliant blue and white patterns on the smaller creatures, off set by the dramatic tiger strips on the larger one. Only when they got to the island did MuSu allow himself to be caught.

Pat glanced over at Gabriel's pod, the three of them swimming steadily off to her right. They were probably making about 15 knots per hour, which was respectable, but she didn't want to tire Petra or risk any complications with her now three-month-old pregnancy. Petra sensed Pat's look, and flashed her a thumbs up. Pat again marveled at how even Petra, with her extraordinary large breasts and her pregnancy, could still slip through the water with such ease and grace.

Pat turned her attention to her own pod, and felt the comforting presence of everyone's electrical signatures, no one signaling any distress. She could tell the mood and health of her pod mates, she had discovered, but she could only sense strong emotions in the other mers. She extended her senses further to her left and found Agba's pod swimming easily. Everyone was doing well, even though they had been swimming steadily for several hours. They hadn't caught up to MuSu's pod, and she didn't know how far or how fast they had been able to swim. They looked fast when they left, but she wasn't sure how long they could keep up such a furious pace.

She concentrated on her pod mates, sensing Danni and Phoebe's languid strokes, each of them focusing on John's lead. John's powerful tail set their pace, and Pat warmed at the memory of their frenzied reunion last night. Poor John had been forced to make love to each of them twice, and Pat had sensed a driving need in their efforts that seemed different. She remembered back to the strange tug she felt on her second coupling with John. She was looking into John's eyes as he stroked in and out of her, and she wondered what color eyes any child of theirs would have as she gazed into his steel grey eyes. Would she have green eyes, like her own, or blue or grey or something else? She knew, both intuitively and scientifically, that all their children would be female, and a select few would transition to males. So focused was she on that image, on her daughter's eyes, that a strange tug, deep within her tail, surprised her.

Pat had never felt that muscle before. It was a pleasurable tug, deep and strong, almost like a cramp, but it triggered an even more intense orgasm that kept her impaled, quivering and twitching, on John's pumping cock for several minutes. Her internal muscles had rippled along his cock, ripping his own orgasm from him, and then kept them together in a suction so strong that John couldn't separate himself from her even after he had finished coming. Pat had lost consciousness during the orgasm, and it took several minutes before she recovered.

When Danni had asked what she was doing to have such a tremendous orgasm, Pat explained that she was thinking about Petra and wondered what color the eyes of any child she and John might have would be. Evidently, both Danni and Phoebe were able to think similar thoughts and achieve similarly strong orgasms. As with Pat, both girls had lost consciousness during their orgasms. John, exhausted, was barely able to finish the fish Pat had brought for him before he fell asleep.

As she looked at her pod, she could still sense the glow from both Danni and Phoebe. She knew she was glowing too. No ... wait ... it was more than a glow.

Pat closed her eyes, and focused on each of her sister wives with her mer-senses, and then herself, and then Petra. She nearly stopped swimming in shock, but instead, she savored a new kind of warmth that spread through her body. Well, how about that, Pat thought to herself. She had discovered the secret to mermaid fertility. They had to "will it" ... and so they had. She and her pod mates were pregnant; their electrical signatures had each changed, just like Petra's. She would share the news with the others that evening when they reached the atoll. For now, she savored her secret all by her self.

Emma thought that the morning marathon would have tired everyone out, but she wasn't going to complain. Cleo had managed to tackle MuSu in the shallow water of the lagoon, and the two of them were pounding into each other in the surf. It was Cleo's reward for not complaining, after all. Now Emma watched as Cleo and MuSu rolled and swam in the one meter of water, laughing and moaning, switching positions and rhythms without ever uncoupling. Emma was on the beach and Rikki was braiding her hair, their flukes resting in a several centimeters of water as the gentle surf washed along their tails barely reaching their pelvic fins.

"I can hardly believe our lives," Rikki mused as she ran her fingers through Emma's soft, lush hair. "We live in a beautiful tropical paradise, and all we do is eat, swim, and have sex."

"I can hardly believe I'm finally your sister," Emma said as she closed her eyes to concentrate on the feelings of Rikki's fingers in her hair.

"You're more than my sister," Rikki said, shifting her stroking to include Emma's softly sloping shoulders and dramatically thin waist. "You're my sister-wife, my best friend, and my lover," she whispered into Emma's ear, brushing aside her long brown hair, licking her ear lobe.

Emma shivered with desire, and leaned back into Rikki's caresses. "We are the only ones among all the pods who are truly 'sister-wives," Emma observed.

"I love you, Emma," Rikki whispered as she nuzzled Emma's neck. "I always loved Martin, but I love you more than I thought possible."

Emma tilted her head back and found Rikki's soft full lips with her own, and nibbled at her lips. She teased with her tongue along Rikki's white teeth and ruby lips. Emma gasped as Rikki held her face firmly and kissed her with increasing passion, her tongue pushing into Emma's mouth, searching, caressing, exploring. They kissed passionately for several moments before Rikki turned her body and lowered both of their shoulders to the damp sand.

They faced each other, on their sides, their breasts pressed into one another's as they ran their hands along each other's flanks. Emma watched as her now delicate, feminine hand traced the bulge of Rikki's breast out from her rib cage, and let it fall along the dramatic indentation of her waist, accentuated by their posture on the beach. She watched as her hand rose along the swell of Rikki's hips, and noted the barely perceptible change in texture from skin to scales as tanned skin merged with blue and white spots. One set of their pelvic fins was pressed to the sand, while the other flapped and teased at each other's in the air. Emma grabbed Rikki's fin and stroked along the yellow fringe that decorated the trailing edge. She gasped with pleasure as Rikki mimicked her actions on her own fin. She was so happy that her tail was such a source of pleasure.

As they held each other's face with one hand and kissed, their other hands found each other's vent, their labia now swollen with blood and passion. The nub of their clitorises were hard and wet, not with water but with their own fluids. Emma gasped into Rikki's unceasing kisses as she felt two fingers ease into her vagina while Rikki's thumb flicked across her clit. She eased two of her own fingers into Rikki's molten vent and ran her thumb across her sister-wife's clit, which caused her to moan too.

Emma backed away from Rikki's frantic kisses to look at her beautiful identical twin. Emma looked into Rikki's large, oval blue eyes that sparkled with passion. Their noses were only centimeters apart, their lips open, their breath hot upon each other's faces. Emma stroked her sister's lush, chocolate brown hair, feeling its softness and texture, even as her other hand continued to push in and out of her sisterwife' s dripping vagina. She closed her eyes briefly, savoring the wonderful sensations caused by Rikki's fingers as they pumped in and out of her own sopping wet hole. Emma loved the way her new body responded to sex, the rippling of her body outward from her womb, resonating in her breasts that swelled with milk, her nipples extending, hardening.

She opened her eyes with a gasp as Rikki pushed their breasts together, rubbing her leaking nipples on Emma's own satisfyingly stiff and equally leaky nipples. She twisted her flukes across Rikki's and doubled her efforts to bring her sister-wife to orgasm, but gasped herself as Rikki added another finger to her efforts. She too added a third finger and sought the hard knob of Rikki's G-spot that was just at the tip of her fingers inside her vagina. As their breasts continued to slide and push against one another's, Emma could feel her own orgasm beginning to build, and she fought to hold it off until Rikki began to twitch. Suddenly both girls were drenched in breast milk as their orgasms ripped through their bodies and cum flooded their fingers as they jerked on the beach, their hands buried within each other's pulsing vaginas. Their flukes were at full extension, quivering in the noon sun, spraying light, color, and water in all directions, the sound of their fluttering flukes nearly overwhelmed by their screaming orgasms.

After a few moments, when they finally stopped shaking, two pairs of hands grabbed their flukes and pulled them into the surf. Laughing, Emma turned to MuSu as Rikki turned to Cleo.

"See, I told you that you could have first dibs," Emma laughed.

"Depends on whom I wanted first dibs with," Cleo teased as she pulled Rikki into a deep kiss.

A few strong strokes later, Emma was moaning into MuSu's shoulder as he rolled with her in the surf, feeling herself shudder around his stiff and unflagging penis. As she convulsed in yet another orgasm, she faintly heard her sister-wives each crying out in their own.

There were hundreds of small atolls scattered throughout the South Pacific, some of the larger ones could even support human life, if it was carefully husbanded. One such atoll had two humans who were precariously clinging to life. Their experimental, secret submarine had suffered a catastrophic failure of the hull about eight weeks ago. No one knew why the hull had failed, but only ten crewmembers managed to escape. There had been no time-the water flooded the sub within seconds-and only those crewmembers in the scientific module at the bow had managed to make it out.

There had been six scientists and about 60 crewmembers on the vessel, but only the scientists had escaped along with four other crewmembers. They discovered that they escape pod they were able to launch as the sub plummeted to the ocean floor lacked adequate food and water, and the emergency beacon would not work. Some of the standard survival equipment was missing, and they had no means of fishing. They had drifted for two days before they managed to land the pod/raft on this very small island, and were pleased to discover that the atoll had a small, natural spring and a few palm trees. They set up a camp, scavenging the escape pod for materials, and they hoped against hope that they would be found. The ranking crewman, who was not an officer, explained that there was little chance of rescue. The sub was at the beginning of a two-month, clandestine, special ops tour for surveillance and reconnaissance. Their superiors wouldn't even know to look for them until long after they had run out of food.

They struggled on the small island, growing weaker and hungrier as time passed. Several crewmembers were lost to sharks while they were attempting to hunt fish, and the other two had simply gone mad and swam out to sea. It hadn't helped when they learned that their guns were nearly useless to hunt fish. Bullets never reached their targets, and so they were forced to go into the water to try to collect food with knives and crudely made spears.

As more time passed, and hunger drove them further out to sea to search for food, the remaining scientists had became food themselves, as the sharks were particularly aggressive. Now, there were only two left.

Alexander and Grisha had been part of a "secret" team doing research on deep-sea biological and genetic experiments, but now they were quickly shrinking shells of themselves, nearly mad with hunger and thirst, surviving on what shellfish and seaweed they could collect. It wasn't enough. They were slowly starving themselves to death. But the deeper water was too dangerous, a difficult lesson they learned as they watched their friends and crewmates disappear with a sharp tug beneath the waves. So, they had given up on trying to get larger fish, and now they were too weak to do anything other than wait for the end to come.

As they finished their lunch, MuSu and the girls decided to keep going. They felt a bit stretched, but they knew that hadn't reached "their limits," which was part of what they needed to know. How far and how fast could they push themselves? The answer might be the difference between life and death in the future.

"Let's try something different," Emma said as she finished un-braiding Cleo's hair. All the girls loved to play with one another's hair, but Emma knew that if they left their gills exposed to the sun, it would be dangerous.

"How so?" asked MuSu?

"One of the things that seemed strange to me was how quickly we recovered from our fatigue when we surfaced," Emma explained. "We were all pretty tired, but after only a few minutes of breathing the air, we all recovered enough to have some pretty awesome sex."

"So, what ... we should swim on our backs?" asked Rikki

"No," Emma explained. "I think we should develop a rhythm, sort of like the dolphins do."

"But they have to breathe the air," Cleo observed, "They don't have gills."

"Right," Emma agreed, "but I think that we are still mammal enough that if we regularly breathe the air, we will be much faster and last longer."

"But we risk being seen?" MuSu observed.

"True," Emma agreed. "But this is the South Pacific, and that isn't very likely. If we are spotted, we are likely to have enough warning to get below and stay there. From far away I bet we look more like a large fish than we think we do. After all, we're mostly tail."

"I think you're right," MuSu agreed, looking down his nearly three meters of strong, shimmering, mer-tail. "We are about the same size as large dolphins or sailfish."

"We look like sailfish," Emma corrected. "You look like a dolphin. Sailfish rarely reach your length, and we must weigh at least as half as much as you do."

"So, what should we try, before we get into an argument about who weighs what?" Rikki asked.

"Let's follow MuSu's lead, since he does most of the work," Emma explained. "We can draft just like we did this morning; we will just know that every minute or two or whatever, we will all breach and take a big breath of regular air."

"I'll expel whatever air is left in my lungs right before I head for the surface, so that can be a signal," MuSu suggested.

"Remember, build up our speed slowly, because we will reach our top speed before you do," Cleo worried.

"Don't you worry," MuSu with a kiss, "I can sense each of you clearly, and I know the exact point when you all have reached your top speed. I know I could go faster, but I suppose that's why you draft my wake."

"We were all doing about 30 knots this morning," Emma observed, "if my calculations are reasonable. It took us about six hours to go almost 200 nautical miles. That is faster than most boats go," she finished impressed with their own speed.

"That is faster than dolphins can go without drafting on boats," MuSu added. "I've been listening to Pat, miss smarty pants," he finished as Emma raised her eyebrows in surprise. "They usually swim at about 10 knots and can only go 25 knots for short periods of time."

"Well, let's see if we can go faster than that!" Emma urged.

They all wiggled their way off the beach and into the water. Emma made a few more observations and indicated a direction for MuSu. They all nodded, sensing directions in the same way they sensed the shape of the sea floor or the presence of sharks several hundred meters north of their current location.

MuSu built up speed slowly, as Cleo had asked, and soon they had reached their previous top speed. Now, rather than swimming several meters below the surface, they were within a meter of the surface, swimming in tight formation. With a burst of air and a flick of his tail, MuSu was headed for the surface and the girls stayed glued to their formation.

Their hydrophobic skin, scales, and hair caused the water to fall off them as they launched into the air, all four creatures arcing gracefully above the water. They traveled for about two meters through the air before MuSu curved back into the water. He remembered watching dolphins draft the boats as he (well, back then he was a she) traveled from Hong Kong to Macau, and so he took only a few quick strokes and headed back for the surface.

The speed was exhilarating, Emma thought! They were swimming with enormous energy, cresting the surface every few strokes, keeping their bodies parallel to the water, stretching out each leap in shallow arcs above the water, feeling the cool water enfold them as they sliced back into its embrace; then leaping forward into the air, the water falling away from their bodies, their hair staying plastered to their backs as they leapt from wave to wave to wave. They were all breathing easily, effortlessly, as they sliced through the air and water, laughing and swimming, winking at each other as they cruised through and above the water. Duh, she thought to herself. The air was much less dense than the water, and therefore it was even easier to maintain their high speed, because they were spending as much time as possible in the air.

Four hours later, they had reached the location of the submarine, and they hardly seemed winded. They had discovered how extraordinary a marine mammal that mers actually were, and they were so energized by their discovery, that they decided to keep swimming past the location of the sub. They had made a 370 nautical mile trip in about ten hours, and they were exhilarated. Emma estimated that their top speed was about 40 knots, and that MuSu and the other mermen could probably reach 50 knots or more on their own.

"Yes, they were here earlier today," Phoebe said, pointing to the distinctive trail left by a mermaid salamandering across the sand, disappearing suddenly where the waves had smoothed over the sand. "High tide was earlier today, sometime in the early afternoon, so they were here before then. I would say a little after noon."

"Which means that they were swimming incredibly fast for a very long time," Pat concluded. "What time do you think it is now?"

"I would guess early evening, say 8 PM," Phoebe said, looking at the sun hovering a few degrees above the horizon.

"Which meant that we swam ... " asked Pat.

"Geesh, don't you ever stop being a scientist," teased Danni as she snuggled up to Pat and gave her a quick kiss.

"I like it," Phoebe said.

"Brown-noser," Danni teased.

"Blonde," Phoebe taunted.

"Look who's talking," Danni said smiling.

"Girls," Pat warned, "we are in the middle of something?"

"Oh, right, sorry," Phoebe said. "Um, that means that we were doing just over 15 knots to go 188 nautical miles in about 12 hours."

"Right," Pat agreed. "And that didn't seem to tire us out."

"You mean didn't tire Petra out," Phoebe said indicating the now resting Petra, her former uncle who was now several months pregnant.

"I feel great," Petra said from her lounging spot on the sandy beach, finishing up some squid that Gabriel had brought for her. Xing was playing with Petra's hair while Gabriel and Agba had gone fishing, Angara and Liga lounged nearby. John was the only male mer present.

"No, I mean that it didn't tire US out," Pat repeated.

"What do you mean us?" Phoebe teased, "I'm younger than either of you old ladies."

"She means tire you out because all three of you are pregnant," Xing said blithely as she braided Petra's hair.

"What!" John sputtered, rising from the sand on the other side of Pat.

"Yes, dear," Pat smiled. "last night ... all three of us."

"But how ... why ... when?" he continued.

"I thought you guys were different this morning," Liga said, "but I thought it was because I am still learning how to be a mermaid."

"You're doing great," Pat said. "I noticed it this morning too, and I think I've put together some important clues."

"Oh my GOD! You're right!" Danni squealed, opening her eyes, "I can feel it ... I'm different inside!" She rolled over Pat and tackled John, kissing him soundly. "I'm going to be a mother!"

"What important clues?" demanded Phoebe, who sounded both excited and frightened at the same time?

"Petra," Pat asked, "do you remember anything different when you were making love to Michael?"

"What do you mean, different?" asked Petra.

"Did you have a particularly memorable orgasm a few days before he died?" Pat asked gently.

"Yes, I did!" Petra answered, remembering.

"Did you feel anything strange in your tail just before you orgasmed?" Pat continued.

"Yes, I think I did," Petra answered, thinking. "I felt some sort of muscle cramp in my tail, but I thought it was just the passion I was feeling and I was being too rough."

"And were you thinking about having a child?" Pat asked.

"I was always thinking about that," Petra answered, "but that time, I was thinking about Michael's eyes, and what would happen if we did have a child, you know, what color the baby's eyes would be."

"Oh, my god," Phoebe breathed. "That IS how it worked! We really are pregnant." She fell into Pat's embrace. "What are we going to do?"

"Have a baby," Pat answered calmly, stroking her sister-wife's nearly white blond hair. "But at least we will know what to expect, thanks to Petra."

"That's it?" asked Xing, incredulous. "You have to think of the eyes? I've been wanting a child with Gabriel for months, but I never think of eyes, I always think of tail," she finished, running her hands along her own forest green and lavender tail.

"Oh, Xing, you must have first go with Gabriel tonight," Petra gushed. "Between your hazel and his violet eyes I can only imagine a wonderful, beautiful playmate for Michelle that you might have," she finished as she caressed her own belly, even though there was no outward sign that she was pregnant.

"Well, now we finally know what constitutes mermaid birth control," John concluded. "That must be why no one got pregnant despite all the sex we were having."

"Are you sure?" asked Phoebe.

"I think he's right," Pat agreed.

"Right? Of course I'm right," John concluded. "I knew something was different last night, and now I'm never opening my eyes during sex again."

"Ah, don't you dare," Danni demanded as she began tickling her podmate.

"You can't make me," John gasped as he writhed on the sand under her merciless attack.

"Maybe she can't, but WE can," Pat said, lifting herself away from Phoebe and joining Danni in the attack.

"I think I could live with that," Phoebe mused. "I want to be a scientist," she concluded as she winked at Petra and Xing and joined her sister-wives in tickling the now nearly helpless John.

"Stop ... top ... uh ... please," he pleaded as the three mermaids squirmed and rubbed themselves all over him as they ground him into the sand. "I'm getting sand in places I shouldn't," he complained.

"No problem," Danni said with a wink to Pat and Phoebe. The girls clasped hands and rolled all four of them into the water. They disappeared beneath the surface laughing and giggling.

"I can't wait until our men get back," Xing said with passion and purpose in her voice.

"Me too," said Liga as Angara lifted a surprised eyebrow at her. "Well, I think it must be why I got changed, to give you and Agba children."

"Quién dice que yo no desean a niña?" Angara asked with a smile and a kiss for Liga.

"Looks like everyone will be pregnant shortly," Petra mused. "Perhaps we ought not to tell the triplets, and maybe they won't get pregnant. Someone has to get food for the rest of us."

It was near sunset when the remaining Russians concluded that they had finally gone completely mad.

Grisha had stretched out his increasingly thinning body on the beach, his head propped up against one of the few palm trees on the atoll. He had stumbled down to the water earlier in the day, searching for food of any kind, hoping for a half-eaten fish to wash ashore. After several hours of nearly fruitless searching, he had retreated to the scant shelter he and Alexander occupied. Grisha had been a big man, nearly 6' 4'' (193 cm), almost too big to fit onto the submarine, but at 50 years old, he was the leading scientist in his field, and he had insisted that he be allowed to carry out the experiments he had designed. When he first squeezed his bulk into his submarine berth, he weighed nearly 300 pounds (136 kg). Now, he was lucky if he weighed 200 lb (90 kg).

He looked over at the sleeping Alexander, who was nearly a foot shorter (173 cm), and weighed about half as much as he did. Grisha didn't think Alexander would make it through the night, and he didn't relish the thought of spending his last few days on earth next to a rotting scientist, even if he had always respected Alexander's work.

He was about to close his eyes when he saw a school of large fish approaching from the south. They were swimming like dolphins, leaping and skimming along the surface of the water, headed directly for the island. They weren't dolphins, however, the colors were all wrong, and it looked like the creatures had brown skin at their noses, pale skin along their mid-flanks, and brightly mottled blue and white skin along their longish tails. The largest one had black and yellow tiger stripes. How could that be? They were large, perhaps three or four meters long. He was a geneticist, not a biologist, like his surviving crewmate.

"Alexander, my friend," Grisha whispered, his voice dry and strained, "do those look like dolphins to you?"

With a supreme effort, Alexander lifted his head from the sand and gazed out at the sea. He could see the flashes of color and light as a small pod of brightly colored sea creatures burst from the sea, and he swore he could hear laughter, female laughter.

"We have gone mad, Grisha," he whispered back, "those are rusalka."

"Either we are mad, or we are saved," Grisha said as he struggled to his feet. "Here, here!" he croaked. "We are here, save us," he shouted in Russian.

The effort cost him is consciousness, and he fell to the ground in a heap. Alexander saw that the strange creatures had seen them as he felt his own consciousness slipping away, but not before he could make out the faces of three beautiful women who gazed at him in shock and surprise.

He smiled as he succumbed to the darkness, unsure if he would ever wake again.

"Well, is it working?" Cleo asked impatiently.

"I don't know," Emma answered calmly. "I have no idea how long we were unconscious the first time we were fed."

MuSu looked over at the two girls who each cradled the head of a nearly dead Russian sailor in their laps. He and Rikki had scoured the small island, hidden the one handgun they found, and now Rikki was filling one of their canteens with her milk, massaging her young breast so that streams of mermaid milk shot into the plastic bottle.

"You've done all you can for the moment," MuSu advised. "We will leave them the canteen and we should return after we meet up with everyone else; this is not something for us to try on our own."

"But will it be enough to save them?" Cleo asked, her mothering instincts coming to the fore.

"It only took us two hours to reach this island," Emma argued. "We can stay overnight, to see if they regain consciousness, and at least to force them to drink a little more of our milk. We can easily swim back long before the others will reach the submarine."

"They will die if we don't save them," Cleo added.

"They may die anyway," MuSu said. "Alright, we can't sleep in the water around this island, there are too many sharks along that reef, which is probably where the rest of the crew ended up."

"Why didn't they bother us?" asked Rikki, replacing the top on the now filled canteen.

"Because we are as fast as they are," Emma surmised, "and they've never seen a mer before."

"They might attack us if they are hungry enough," MuSu thought, "but let's not give them the chance. First, finish the food I brought for all you nursemaids."

After they finished eating, they arranged themselves on the beach, well above the high tide mark, in a star formation. They found that when in strange places it was a good idea to have their tails (and thus their mer senses) pointing in multiple directions. While their mer-senses didn't work as well out of water as in, they could still sense when someone or something approached. When they were in the water, sleeping entwined around MuSu, there was a dorsal ridge facing each direction of the compass. On land, their fringes along their flukes and fins would have to suffice. They also knew that their maximum air time was about eight hours, and then they would begin to feel too dry and that would wake up to seek the water. The day's efforts and excitement had worn them out, and the nooner had taken the edge off their sexual drives. So, with only kisses all around, they quickly fell asleep.

By the next afternoon, the Russians had not yet regained consciousness, but neither had they died. Emma half sensed and half hoped that their milk was having the desired effect. Her mer-senses seemed to suggest that their health was improving, but with anyone other than her pod mates, it was tough to tell. They had dribbled more milk onto their lips, and both men seemed to respond, enough so the contents of the canteen slowly disappeared into their bodies. The girls refilled two canteens in case the men awoke while they were gone, and returned to the water.

As MuSu and his girls began the swim back to the sub, Emma began to construct her justification and argument for Pat and John, their de facto leaders. After all, two pods were short of the optimal ratio, and she was sure she could convince anyone of the benefits of becoming both a female and a mermaid.

MuSu kept a slightly slower pace, probably about 25 knots, but with the new technique of flying along the surface of the water, even that speed seemed effortless.

They had been waiting for several hours, floating about five meters below the surface, several hundred meters above the submarine, before the rest of the pods arrived. Emma wasted no time not only making a full report of their findings concerning mer-physiology, stamina, swimming techniques, and top speeds but also the news about the Russian sailors they had found, probably the only ones surviving from the sub below.

Pat advised the triplets of her own discovery concerning children, and the relief in their eyes gratified her. They couldn't stop having sex, but they could exercise some control over when they had children. Pat giggled as MuSu recoiled in horror as Cleo playfully batted her eyes at him. It was the first time she could recall him losing his cool. All three girls were adamant, however, about not starting a family yet, especially with everyone else getting pregnant.

The triplets reluctantly agreed to wait until the next morning before returning to the atoll. Throughout the night, each pod took up guard duty, but the night passed without incident, and in the morning, they all headed for the atoll and the Russians.

Thirty-five was too young an age to die, Alexander thought to himself, as he sensed a bright light filling his consciousness. But he could also feel warmth emanating from that bright light. He could also feel something on his chest, and the sand beneath his head, and ... yes, the sound of the waves as they caressed the beach. He realized that he was feeling the sun as it rose in the east. He didn't think he would ever see another, and yet here he was, slowly awakening to beautiful sunrise. He had an odd taste in his mouth, but he felt better than he had in a long time. He was ravenously hungry, but as his eyes blinked open in the morning light, he felt truly alive for the first time in several weeks.

He sat up, marveling at his own returning strength, and felt the canteen that had been placed on his chest slide down to his lap. How had that canteen gotten there, he wondered. And how did Grisha manage to get to the spring a hundred meters behind them? He saw a second canteen perched on Grisha's chest, and saw that his fellow scientist was still asleep. He carefully opened his canteen and smelled the sweet smell of ambrosia. He wasn't sure what it was; it smelled faintly of flowers and salt, perhaps milk, but that was impossible. He carefully raised the canteen to his lips, and as the warm, sweet liquid poured down his throat, he swore that he could feel energy and life returning to his body with each small sip.

He pulled the plastic bottle from his lips, shocked at how he was feeling, and then turned to the ocean, where he could see more than a dozen heads bobbing in the water a few meters from shore. They were the most beautiful creatures he had ever seen, four men, and nearly a dozen women, each more beautiful than the next. The one with flaming red hair waved at him, and he waved back, shoving his now working foot into the side of Grisha's still sleeping form.

"Wake up, Grisha," he urged. "We have company!"

It was fortunate that Grisha spoke Chinese; otherwise, they would have been days in explaining everything to the Russians. Alexander could ask for beer and the bathroom in English, and Grisha was not much better. But Grisha's Chinese was good. Both men had gained strength and mobility throughout the morning as they listened to Pat and John while they slowly finished their canteens. Pat explained the history of the mers, and how they came to be, corrected only occasionally by Xing when Pat's still fledgling Chinese failed her.

Grisha had no problem understanding the story of the mers and what was already happening to him and his fellow countryman, whether they liked it or not. There was a tense moment, however, when Alexander finally understood that the milk he was drinking was a change agent, one that was likely to take him down a path of femininity.

A frantic conversation in Russian between the two men erupted, occasionally interrupted by angry questions directed at the mers, suggesting that perhaps Agba or Gabriel switch back to female. Even Petra was surprised by the strength of Gabriel's refusal.

After another ten minutes of heated conversation, there were several moments of tense silence, while Alexander glowered at Agba, Gabriel, and then Grisha, again and again. He finally smiled at Emma, said something in Russian, and drank again from the canteen.

"You saved my life," Grisha translated in Chinese.

"We're sorry that you have to become girls," Emma said in her own halting Chinese. "I used to be a boy, and this is much better."

"We shall see," Grisha returned with little emotion.

The two men talked again in Russian for a few minutes, and then Alexander nodded at Agba, lifted his canteen in salute, and then downed the contents. Agba nodded with respect, while Angara and Liga looked approvingly at their new pod mate. Everyone sighed in relief for several reasons. First, because the Russians seemed reconciled to their situation, second because Grisha and Alexander had come to an agreement about who would go to which pod, and finally (but not the least factor for relief) was because an important new knowledge base would be added to their growing community.

The mers returned to the sea to look for a protected area in which the transformations might occur, and after several hours of searching the land shelf of the atoll and several other smaller islands, they found a small underwater cave that although shallow, offered some protection from the surrounding sea. It was in about five meters of water, and if the Russians followed the "standard" patterns of transition, as had the other recent mers, they would have proto gills by the next morning.

Grisha waited on the beach for the return of the mers. As predicted, the next morning both men had immature gills on their backs, and Alexander had insisted that he go first. He had apparently been thinking about his decision all night, and if any of the tales the mers had told were true, then he would be able to communicate with his new family and community right after his transition, and he was tired of waiting for Grisha's slow and cumbersome translations. He wanted to speak to these fascinating and beautiful new people, even if the price was his own masculinity. Grisha didn't entirely believe him, but it was enough, Alexander could go first.

Alexander had gone off with the rest of the mers, surprisingly eager for his new life. Grisha had stayed behind, still struggling with what was about to happen to him. He understood genetics, and he suspected that Pat had stumbled upon an important discovery, one that transcended all his previous research. Hell, this discovery transcended his gender, his own country, and even his own species. Nevertheless, Grisha was not as eager to become a mermaid as Alexander, even if he was to be paired to the incredible Petra-a fine Slavic name-and the delicate and beautiful Xing. Frankly, Gabriel scared him, especially after he angrily refused Grisha's suggestion that Gabriel return to his former gender. Grisha had rarely seen such fire and power in anyone's eyes, and wondered what could make a former female, Christian missionary, become such a dynamic and powerful merman.

He wondered for a moment how much of a factor the ratio of mass to mermaid and mermen contributed to the way he was feeling. He had always been a big man, while Alexander was slight. Perhaps that is why Alexander chose the smaller Filipino pod, as he or she would probably end up as a large female in that pod. Well, in that case, he would probably be the equal of Petra, who was the tallest and most voluptuous of all the mermaids. What would he look like, he wondered. Pat had told him that he should be thinking of some one he knew, that he would become something like that woman. He had no idea what he should look like.

He distracted himself from his upcoming transformation by puzzling out the mechanisms of the milk that still sloshed in the canteen they had left with him while Alexander under went his change. Grisha's own work had involved transgenic adaptations in various sea animals. He would attempt to isolate single genes, like the ability to generate bioluminescent light that many deep-sea fish had, and then insert them into the fertilized eggs of other fish so that the resulting gene would be "turned on" in the resulting adult. These "transgenes" were typically inserted into eggs using a glass needle, but the method was not reliable and rarely resulted in a successful birth. However, when it was successful, the new organism passed on the new trait to its offspring with out any problems.

Grisha suspected that Pat's experiments with the original fish goop had resulted in a transgenic agent that merged biological, chemical, neurological, and some yet undiscovered processes into a change agent that was incredibly powerful and had limitless possibilities. He could create bacteria that produced medicine, or bio-computers capable of augmenting the human brain. Well, now, that was a thought more interesting to him than what color his tail might be. What if he focused on becoming incredibly bright, a super computer brain, while he underwent the change? If having that knowledge and those abilities meant becoming a girl-a mermaid-then he would pay that price, he decided. He was unsure of Alexander's, well ... now probably Alexis', motives, but he didn't trouble himself with any of the details. If what Pat said was true, her breasts held the secrets to eternal life and the salvation of mankind.

Life as a girl, huh? Like many ambitious scientists, he had never managed to couple himself to anyone who seemed compatible, but he had had several girlfriends and lovers. He mulled over his impending changes and thought that he could probably adapt. He especially liked that all the pods were bi-sexual, though secretly, he wished that he could be the male. Petra was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen, human or not, and he was very glad when Alexander had picked the smaller pod to join. He suspected that if anything ever happened to Agba, Alexander would be eager to make the transition to merman. He knew that such thoughts entered his mind concerning Gabriel.

His thoughts were interrupted by the sight of a striking female face that rose from the water a few meters from the beach. Her feminine face shone with a bright inner light, her deep blue eyes were set wide apart above strong cheek bones and full lips, hinting at her Russian heritage, while her blonde hair cascaded down her shoulders.

"Are you coming, Galina?" the woman asked in perfect Russian.

Grisha smiled at the imaginatively mangled feminine version of his name, but he liked it.

"Yes, Alexis," he said, guessing at what the former biologist had done to his name, and he rose to stride into the water. "I am coming."

It took twenty minutes to reach the cave, which was at the far end of the land shelf for this small island. Grisha watched with fascination as both Agba's and Gabriel's pods escorted him through the water. He was naked, and his hairy and now thin body felt like a feather being pulled along by Gabriel's strong strokes. Petra and Xing swam along side, near the surface, while Agba's pod with their newest addition swam below them, warding off the many sharks that had already claimed his friends and countrymen.

The sharks seemed genuinely spooked by the mers, and Grisha wondered if the mer's bio-electro-chemical systems had something to do with that. Sharks had very sensitive electroreceptor organs, and apparently, the mers shared a similar sensitivity. Whatever the reason, the sharks shied away from the two pods even as they dragged along their still vulnerable human.

Grisha noted that his gills were already working, but he still needed to turn on his side to take a breath of air. When he turned back to face down, he could see Alexis swimming with her new pod mates. She was the largest mermaid in that pod, about a foot (30 cm) longer than the white and pink female and the black and white female. Alexis was still a few centimeters shorter than Agba, but his silver and black tail was wider, stronger, and longer than hers. Alexis' blond hair flowed down her back, her tiny waist, and over her now wide (and pink) hips. Her dorsal ridge, the ends of her flukes and fins were all tinged with white highlights while her long and graceful tail matched the pink highlights of the white-tailed female.

Grisha examined the coloration of his future pod mates, and suddenly thought about his mother. She had been a redhead, not like Pat's bright and rich red, but lighter, almost a pale reddish blond, with clear blue eyes. She loved the rich colors of the forest and farm, and Petra and Xing's coloration would have made her smile. He remembered that she used to wear a dark maroon dress to church that enhanced her pale, freckled skin and her feathery red hair. He smiled, as he remembered his now dead mother, and thought yes, I finally know what I will look like.

Petra, perhaps sensing his resolution, caressed his arm, and signaled that he should take a final breath before they plunged down 10 meters to the cave below. He would have enough air for about ten minutes, but his transition would soon override that need. He looked upward at the blue sky, untouched by clouds, breathed deep his last breath as a human male, and turned for the bottom.

Gabriel pulled him into the center of the cave where all the other mers had arranged themselves in a circle. The sensual charge in the cave was palpable, and all the mers were bioluminescent, pale light shimmering up and down their dorsal ridges and along their flukes and fins, augmenting the dim light filtering from above. He felt his heart begin to pound, not because he was in 10 meters of water and the pressure was intense, but rather because he could sense the power and majesty that these creatures exuded. He struggled to maintain his focus on the super smart brain he would have as Petra gathered him to her enormous breasts, and said, "Welcome Galina, drink from me and receive your tail."

As his lips slowly closed the distance to her out thrust nipple, he felt light headed and dizzy. He tried to remember his mother, but found he could not.

"Wait," he said, wasting some of his air.

Petra sensed something was wrong, and Grisha watched as her chest rose and fell quickly, and then she pulled him to her mouth as though to kiss him. He was surprised when she blew a lungful of air into him.

"Go ahead, talk," She urged, "I can keep giving you air."

"You can?" he asked, stunned.

"Yes, but let's not waste too much time here," Petra cautioned. "What is the problem?"

"I can't hold the vision in my head," he said softly, only Petra could hear him. "Too dizzy, too much ..." Another lungful of air was forced into him.

"My mother ... maroon dress, light red hair, blue eyes," he whispered and then received another lungful of air. "Maroon tail ... your size," he finished.

"My size?" Petra asked. "All of my size?" she asked, sweeping her gaze along her breasts and hips.

He nodded.

"Alright everyone," she said in her mermaid's silvery voice, "His mother's coloring, a maroon tail, blue eyes, and light red hair; now concentrate." She gave Grisha/Galina another breath of air, and then pulled him back to her breast.

Grisha/Galina could feel the shift in energy in the cave, and everyone started humming. He found Petra's large breasts irresistible, and he closed his lips around her large nipple. The milk literally gushed down his throat, and he could feel a new energy building within his naked body. He frantically gulped her milk as it literally poured from her breasts. He could feel new strength in his body after only a few minutes, and the pressure from the water seemed to lessen. By the time he had finished her other breast, he could tell that his gills were working just fine, and that his journey toward womanhood, or rather mermaid-hood, had begun in earnest.

Petra could see that Grisha/Galina's dark brown eyes had lightened, and his/her body looked healthier. She could also tell that motherhood had increased her potency, and she gave the changeling a gentle push towards Xing, and resumed humming.

Grisha/Galina floated towards Xing, who was about over a foot shorter than Petra, and took the raven-haired Asian beauty into his arms and kissed her. "My last kiss as a man," he said with a bit of difficulty. Xing smiled and blew a bit of air into her future pod mate and said, "But not your last kiss from me, Galina. Drink from me and receive your tail."

As he drank, "Galina" gave himself over to the vision that both pressed upon her from without, the combined focus and energy of the mers, and pressed outward from within his/her own changing consciousness. He gently sucked on Xing's breast and was surprised to find that her milk gushed with the same force as Petra's. Xing could also feel her increased potency, as the previous night's sex with Gabriel had proved fruitful. Ignorant of Xing's impending motherhood, Galina encircled his still male arms around the delicate Chinese mermaid, and drank deeply from her, focusing on the vision of the redheaded, blue-eyed, maroon mermaid who was very smart. Galina remained the scientist, cataloguing what he/she could feel within his/her body and what he could sense, with growing clarity, that which the mers were projecting onto him.

As he/she moved from Xing to Pat, Galina could feel his body hair falling away, as his male skin began to tighten and shrink. Pat invited him to receive "her" tail, and as Galina pulled deeply from Pat's large breasts, nearly the equal to Petra's, he could begin to feel the power of the mermaid's milk begin to build within his body. After Danni invited "her" to receive her tail, Galina's body began to convulse as the milk's power began to attack her male body, breaking it down, and reforming it into a female one. Phoebe's breasts added more power, more change agent, and Galina could feel his bones shrinking, their mass becoming less and less. His entire body ached, but the power of the milk kept the pain from being too great. Even as the pain of bones changing throbbed throughout his body, Galina could feel a renewed vigor flow through his veins. He was getting younger even as he was changing into a woman.

As Galina turned to John, the largest merman in the group, he could tell that she was about to turn a corner from which there would be no turning back. He could feel the powerful focus of all the mers that hung in the water all around him, their humming seemed to carry the strength of their vision through the water, vibrating through his body, shaping his bones, cells, even his consciousness, to their will. He decided to not fight the force of the mers, but rather sought to keep a focus on his desire to be a genius. It was hard to keep that focus, as the force of fifteen mers bore down on him.

"Welcome Galina, drink from me and receive your tail," John sang as Galina floated towards his incredible cock, thrusting stiffly upwards from his tail, over 35 centimeters (14'') extended outwards at a 45 degree angle. The moment he/she reached out with his/her increasingly delicate hand and took him into HER mouth, she felt the change within. Galina throbbed within her, and soon would be made real. John exploded into her immediately, and she nearly choked as she swallowed it down. Even as his semen pushed down her throat, Galina could feel further changes beginning in her body. Her hips were now pushing outwards, slowly, steadily, painfully, while her shoulders were narrowing, and her rib cage was shifting and shrinking. In seconds, John was done, and Galina was fully in the grip of her transformation.

As she floated to Alexis, she could feel her abdomen tightening and her reproductive organs begin to change. After Alexis sang her invitation, Galina could feel her former fellow scientist's milk begin to force her testicles change into ovaries. Alexis swooned with her first feeding, and focused her thoughts on how Galina would become a sexual goddess. Galina felt the force of Alexis' thoughts, and struggled to remain focused on her super brain, but the strong feelings generated by her penis withdrawing into her body nearly overwhelmed her.

As she moved to Angara and then Liga, the milk continued to build and do it's work. Galina could feel that she was now a woman internally, and her chest began to feel tender and swollen. As she put her hand to Liga's breast, she could see that her hands had fully changed, each finger small and delicate, her index fingers had lengthened and were now her second longest finger. She gave Liga's breast a light squeeze as she began to drink. After a few minutes, Galina could feel her hair pushing out from her scalp, and tickling down her soft, sloping shoulders. As she drifted towards MuSu, she could feel her budding breasts begin to swell, and as each spurt of his semen rushed down her increasingly eager throat, she could feel an echoing pulse push through her breasts as they grew. When she turned to the triplets, she was a complete woman, a strawberry blond match for Petra, with tremendously large breasts, a slim waist, and full rounded hips from which her shapely feminine legs hung, ending in small, delicate female feet.

Barely able to concentrate, Galina hung in the water, feeling her now youthful and female body as the water and the mental focus of all the mers pressed in on her from all sides. As she turned in the water to face one of the triplets, she felt the delayed tug of her enormous breasts pull against her chest, and the water push between her legs, caressing her new vagina. Her long, hairless legs brushed against each other, and she felt her ankles touch, but water still flowed in between her thighs, her legs now separated by her wide hips. She could feel the still strong forces of the milk swirl within her body, and there were more mers from which to drink.

"Galina, my sister, drink from me and receive your tail," one of the triplets sang-Galina could not yet tell them apart. As she pulled on the beautiful breast of the blue and white-tailed mermaid, Petra and Xing floated further down in the water, and began to stroke her legs. Galina moaned into the girl's breast, and began to feel the power for her ultimate transformation begin to build. As milk poured down her throat, she could feel her long beautiful legs stiffening under the ministrations of her soon-to-be-sister-wives.

"Galina, my fellow scientist, drink from me and receive your tail," another triplet sang. Galina vaguely remembered in her near trancelike state that Emma was the young scientist among the triplets. She tried to acknowledge this link, but she was unable to speak. Emma pulled her to her breast, and Galina drank. Her body had stopped shifting and moving as the power built for her penultimate change. Her legs were now frozen, stiffly pointing towards the cave floor, only a meter or so below her toes. Petra and Xing were still stroking her soft, feminine legs, humming along with the rest of the mers as Galina drained one and then the other of Emma's breasts.

"Galina, drink from me and receive your tail," the last triplet sang. Galina could feel powerful forces gathering within her body, as invisible waves of energy rushed up and down her body. She could still feel the combined forces of the mers as they collectively focused their energies on her, and Galina could only manage a whisper of a thought towards her smarter brain. She drank from the girl's breasts, and felt the power build exponentially. When she pulled away from the last of the triplets, her body and mind were fully in the grip of her transformation, and she could feel herself finally desire the final change that was to come.

"Gabriel," she sang for the first time into the water, "give me my tail!"

Petra and Xing shared a knowing look as they turned Galina in the water to face their pod mate. They could feel the incredible forces locked within Galina's body as they guided her stiff form to where Gabriel floated in the water, his long stiff cock pointed rigidly into the water.

As the beautiful Galina slowly floated towards him, Gabriel drank in the vision before him. She was nearly as tall as Petra had been before she became a mermaid, and her body was nearly identical, but there were some differences. Her pale reddish blond hair curled down to her hips, while her deep blue eyes shone with the power and passion of this incredible transformation. Her breasts were the same high, full globes topped with large, protruding nipples, and her waist was the same tiny circumference flowing out smoothly to equally wide hips. Her legs were now vibrating in the water as Petra and Xing guided their future sister-wife to his cock.

"Come, my sister-wife, drink from me and receive your tail," Gabriel sang in his rich baritone.

When his cock slipped past her lips, Gabriel felt the most intense orgasm he had ever felt rip through his body. He arched his back as the waves of pleasure surged through his body, starting deep in his tail and rising up through his cock, and exploding again and again into Galina's mouth. Petra and Xing left Galina's rigid and quivering legs to help hold Gabriel's arms steady as he pumped his seed into their newest mermaid.

When Gabriel stopped spurting, Galina pulled back ... moaning. She felt her arms being pulled out from her body by some outside force, stretching them out horizontally, while her toes were stiffly pointed towards the bottom. She hung suspended in the middle of the circle, surrounded by the pods who were all humming a low tone into the water, their bioluminescence growing as the sensual power of the final transformation built. Galina could feel herself frozen in the water, her entire body rippling with the energies that had been fed to her by the fifteen mers around her.

She catalogued the feelings even as they rushed through her like a lover's caress, each more pleasurable than the next. She knew her eyes were open, but all she could see was a beautiful mermaid with long strawberry hair, piercing blue eyes, large heavy breasts, and a sweeping maroon tail tinged with deep blue fringes. This vision seemed to float in the water as though a mirror was before her, and that image was slowly drifting towards her. She could still feel the others around her, supporting her, controlling her change, and ... a new feeling ... she could feel Petra, Xing, and Gabriel loving her. A love ... a feeling she had never before known, flowing through her body as the vision drifted towards her. The great waves of movement rippled through her body, building in intensity, her whole being was now vibrating with power.

Galina felt a great urge to push, and she moaned loudly into the water as she pressed with her entire body, pushing down. In the middle of the push, she felt her new womb spasm with the most intense pleasure she had ever known, and as the wave of pleasure flowed down her legs, she could feel them knit themselves together into a single unit, thousands of nerves, blood vessels, and cells pulling apart and pushing together, waves and waves of energy pulsing through her legs and lower torso. Then she felt her still pulsing womb slowly sink down a few inches as her still new and unexplored vagina and other internal parts also moved forward and down. She could feel her gills tingling, her enormous breasts out thrust into the cool water, her hair flowing down her back, and she could feel the presence of the others, helping, guiding, loving. She could feel her entire body vibrating, filled with the power of the mermaid's milk.

Galina felt the need to push again, and so she did, and this time felt the bones of her legs break and fuse, merging into a new single structure, longer and fuller than it had been before. Her tail was finally arriving. It hurt as her bones reformed into multiple pieces, but the power of the milk made it bearable. Her bones settled into their new positions, and she began to feel new muscles snaking up from the bottom of her tail, up through her pelvis, anchoring themselves throughout her body. Thin strands of thread twisted their way up through her upper body, while in her tail, thick ropes of muscle throbbed and grew. She could feel new organs developing, as a sense of hollowness expanded underneath her growing dorsal ridge, and she felt herself become slightly more buoyant.

Another push, and she felt a tremor snake down her body, and felt her feet expand out into two enormous flukes that spread out into the water. Another push, and two fins pushed out from her mid-tail, and two more at her hips, each filling with bone, muscle, and nerves. The tremendous energy that had built within her body's core now pushed outward, and her skin began to tingle and twitch. Another smaller push, and a hot tremor flashed up through her torso and flowed out through her arms. She could feel webbing form in between her fingers and new fins push out from her elbows, as new nerves and tissue filled them. She could feel these new nerves hook up with the rest of her body, and Galina understood where the mers' electroreceptor organs were located, along the trailing edges of her fins and flukes and along her dorsal ridge.

Another tremor bubbled up from her belly, washing up through her torso, neck, face, and skull. Galina could feel her skin changing, and a tickling along her tail told her that her scales were filling in, covering her lower body with color. Finally, a final push pulsed from deep within her, and her entire body convulsed, so strongly that she arched backwards in a great release of ecstasy. Her tail curled back above her head and quivered in the faint light of the cave. She found that her eyes could focus again, and she could see her dark, richly shimmering tail, floating a few centimeters above her head, now sparkling with its own bioluminescence. It was gorgeous, a rich, deep maroon that flickered with light, and her fringes were a rich, royal blue that she hoped would match changed her eyes. Suddenly, she was free from the grip of the transformation, and she relaxed in the water, her hair gently swirling around her body.

Emma was wrong; it was better than any orgasm "he" had ever had.

The entire group floated wordlessly in the water admiring Galina's beauty, her long and powerful tail that was now flashing and glowing in the cave as her newly born female passion began to build within her. She could feel many dramatic changes in her body, too many to catalogue. But even as she felt a new kind of horniness rise within her, she discovered that all her senses had improved, and that she could see all the mers more clearly. Already John and MuSu's pods had retreated to various corners of the cave, and had entwined themselves together. Agba took Alexis' hand, and with Angara and Liga, he led them to another part of the cave where the three mers surrounded their new pod-mate, Agba's stiff cock was clearly visible as Alexis shyly reached out to caress it. Galina was shocked to see everyone making love, right in front of everyone else. But that shock passed, as she recognized that her own passion was still rising, still building, and soon it would be beyond any control she might muster.

The combination of this realization with the new sensation of being able to "sense" her own new pod mates caused her to turn her attention to Gabriel, Petra, and Xing, who were waiting for her to recover, each of them filled with need and passion. Even as she recognized that she would lose this battle, Galina attempted to "feel" her own changes one more time. As she quivered in the water, she extended her senses out from the cave to the surrounding sea, and found it strangely absent of fish. She could feel all kinds of smaller animals, but the larger fish were further away than she expected. This strangeness was something to explore later.

Galina focused on her own tail, feeling the water moving over it. She finally dropped her hands to her side, feeling where her skin and scales joined, tracing the swells and dips of her soft, unnaturally smooth skin. She could feel where her hair brushed the top of her tail, she flexed her flukes, and they spread out below her like a Chinese fan, sending faint sparkles of color in every direction. She looked up and smiled at Petra, who was now approaching her new near physical twin.

"You are beautiful," Petra said softly, "so beautiful."

"I had good model," Galina said in broken English, surprising herself with her new knowledge.

"Your English will improve quickly," Petra explained as she reached out to trace the swell of Galina's large breasts. "And you will teach us Russian."

Petra ended the conversation and Galina's attempts to catalogue the feelings of her new body by pulling her into a kiss. Galina swooned with the sensation of Petra's lush lips sliding past her own, their bodies pressed to one another's, their large breasts preventing their tummy's from actually touching. Galina reached around Petra and tried to press their abdomen's together, but their pillow-like breasts were too large. Galina didn't mind, as the pressure of their beautiful, full breasts pressed into one another's was nearly overwhelming.

"But we won't need words for a while," Petra gasped, and kissed her again.

Galina could feel Xing swim up next to her as Gabriel waited patiently for his wives to come to him. Galina could feel the passion that had been rising leap to a new level as Xing's breasts brushed her elbow fins. She didn't think her own breasts could get any bigger, but as Petra's tongue swirled around her teeth, lips, and tongue, and Xing pressed herself along her side, Galina could feel her breasts tighten with passion, and her large nipples stiffened into Petra's, the crinkly flesh twisting and turning as Petra ground herself against her new mate. Xing's small hands were stroking Galina's sides, running along her hair, and then Galina nearly exploded in an orgasm as Xing ran her hand lightly up her gills along her dorsal ridge.

That new lift in passion caused Galina to turn to Gabriel, whose cock was extended obliquely from his obsidian tail, pulsing with strength and power. Galina gave up all thoughts of ever being a man again, and pushed herself towards her new mate, filled with a desire she had never before felt. Petra and Xing swam quickly to stay with her as she made a direct line for Gabriel's cock.

"This Galina's," she murmured as she stroked it with her small hand.

"It's yours and mine and ours," Xing corrected her as she resumed stroking Galina's flanks and breasts.

"There's plenty to share," Petra said with a giggle, "trust me, I know. Go ahead, take a taste," she urged.

Galina looked up at Gabriel's dark face, now softened by her new desire for him, and felt her heart quiver as she looked up into his flashing violet eyes. She looked back at the impressive cock that was centimeters from her face, and she opened her mouth, and slid her lips slowly over the glans of his cock, pushing back his foreskin with her teeth. After a few slow strokes, she lifted herself up and still holding his cock in one hand, kissed him for the first time.

Gabriel held Galina's face gently in his large hands as their tongues danced together. She felt her passion build higher still as she felt his strong hands caress her ears and face as they kissed. She was dimly aware of Xing and Petra each rising along each side of Gabriel, still stroking her with one hand as they positioned themselves over his rising pelvic fins on either side. Galina guided his cock along her vent, feeling for the first time her swollen labia and clitoris as his stiff cock pushed through her furrow. She moaned into Gabriel's kiss, and nearly swooned with lust. Petra and Xing steadied her, keeping her from slipping away from their quartet of love.

She broke from his kisses and looked down at her body, past her swollen breasts, her nipples tight and firm in the cool water, past her slender waist and flat tummy, to where she could now see her mons rising above the rest of her tail, eager and ready for Gabriel's penis. She wrapped her tail around Gabriel's, and began to aim herself for his cock. Once his head had pushed past her outer lips, she raised both hands to Gabriel's neck, and looked deep into his eyes. Such pretty eyes, rich violet, shimmering eyes. How could she ever have feared this merman, she wondered.

He smiled at her, and began to push into her. Galina could feel the slow, steady power of his cock as it slipped into her molten depths. She leaned back, forcing her mons onto his advancing cock until a sharp pain stopped her. Her new hymen prevented her from further movement.

"Go," she whispered to Gabriel.

"Go where?" he asked not quite sure what his new pod-mate meant.

"In," she urged, whimpering in her need.

"Ah," he smiled. "That has been the plan all along." He pressed her head to his shoulder, gave a quick push.

Galina stifled a scream as Gabriel's powerful stroke ripped through her virginity and propelled his cock all the way into her body. She stayed rigid, pressed to his body, feeling his heartbeat against her breasts, her own heart pounding within, as his thick cock throbbed within her newly opened womanhood. After a few moments, she noticed that both Petra and Xing were watching her with lidded eyes, and then looked down to see each of their vents pressed against Gabriel's vibrating pelvic fins. She became conscious of the vibrations that quivered along the length of Gabriel's cock and how her own clit ached with pleasure.

She leaned back again, grinding herself in slow circles on his cock, slowly getting used to the feeling of this now welcome invader. She nodded her head after a few moments, and Gabriel reached down to her pelvic fins, and using them as handles, pushed her hips away from his. She shivered as she felt his strong cock slide slowly from her velvety grasp, and then gasped as he pulled on her fins impaling her to the hilt.

They began a rhythm, in and out, stroking long full strokes, as Galina felt her new breasts swell even further, and the whispers of an orgasm began to rise within her. She watched as Xing cried out, pulling herself lightly to Gabriel as milk spurted from her breasts, her face twisted in pleasure, her entire body twitching and jerking. Petra quickly followed, her enormous breasts filling the water with a cloud of white milk. Still, Galina felt Gabriel's cock work its way slowly and gently in and out of her vagina, feeling the heat and tension rise. Soon, he was slapping himself against her, and now her clit began to throb, tingle, and buzz with each slap.

"Oh, uh, uh, uh," she cried, as her body was filled with new sensations she never dreamed of experiencing.

"Oh, Galina," whispered Petra, pressing her own still spurting breasts against her new mate, "let it come, let it come," urging her forward.

Petra and Xing, now recovering from their own orgasms, shared a look, and then they each lightly stroked Galina's gills together. Galina's body imploded, and she arched her back against the incredible stimulation from her gills, forcing her mons hard against Gabriel's cock. Her vaginal walls clenched around him as the spasms of her first female orgasm roared through her body, her breasts spewing milk into the water. Her eruption of milk was so thick and sudden that Gabriel could not see Galina's face. Galina saw stars as she felt her body quake around Gabriel's cock. Suddenly, his eyes flashed, and she felt his orgasm rise through his cock, through her vagina, and splash hotly, deep within her body. Her body crashed anew through another powerful orgasm, and she screamed her pleasure into the cave, not caring that fifteen other mers shared their space.

What had she ever feared, she dimly though as she savored the long aftershocks of her multiple orgasms. If she had any inkling that this was what life as a mermaid would be like, she never would have let Alexander go first.

To be continued?
