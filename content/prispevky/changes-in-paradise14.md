The epic tail (pun) of Mermaid Island continues. The mer scientists unlock the secret of the microorganisms, Abao attacks, Hank Connor and his crew transition to mers, Joy and Mac face uncertainties, and we learn more about the nature of mer-life.

<!--more-->

The cave was deep inside the single dormant volcano jutting up from the ocean along the western edge of a small island that lay at the intersection of 3 degrees, 23 minutes, and 51 seconds south, and 174 degrees, 40 minutes and 52 seconds west. The small island was largely overlooked by the world, being without adequate land area for an airport, even a small one. It was also a privately owned island, though few people in the world knew either the current owners or the agreements that caused the previous owners to sell their land.

The cave was originally formed by a pocket of hot gas, along with many of the other caves riddling the western interior of the volcano. This one, however, had been altered by the current occupants to suit their needs. A soft white-blue glow from LEDs strung up like holiday lights filled the room, which made visible a line between the natural, gasformed, cave walls and the more recent, acid etched walls. The floor, however, was uniformly smooth, polished clean by the near constant brush of mer-tails. The surprisingly airy cave was twenty meters wide and thirty meters deep and was filled with long, low tables, each about one meter high that were ordered in a five by six rectangular grid, each table about three meters from any other. Two tables nearest to the small pool filling one corner of the room were empty; the rest were piled high with computers and strange looking scientific apparatus. Several large pieces of equipment hulked along the back wall, including an MRI machine, a CAT scanner, and an isolation chamber.

It looked like a perfect place for a mad scientist.

Pat rubbed her green eyes, blinked, then pulled her long sea green tail up behind her and scratched her dorsal ridge, briskly vibrating one corner of her pink-fringed-flukes against the center of her back. As she satisfied her itch, she leaned back into the steam-punk looking apparatus set on the table before her, gently placing her chin on its padded rest. Her dark, red hair fell forward as she concentrated, shielding her eyes from the lights above, her long tail curled back out behind her, nearly hitting the table where two other mermaids were hunched over a computer screen.

"Watch the tail," Galina warned without looking up.

Phoebe stifled a giggle, Pat lifting her head sharply and staring daggers at her pod-mate.

"It wasn't Phoebe who broke that last vial," Alexis said, winking at white-blond Nordic mermaid.

Pat looked from Phoebe's laughing blue eyes down to her sister wife's long blue tail with its white fringes matching her hair, noting that it rested on the leg of Galina's and Alexis' table. She arched an eyebrow at her pod-mate and then turned all the way around to look at her own tail, and despite the teasing she had just endured, she admired, yet again, how beautiful it was. It shimmered in the soft LEDs, her wide flukes curling and twitching as she flexed her "old toes," which were now long, thin bones, making her flukes so flexible and strong. Her tail was nearly a meter longer than her legs had been, and was a brilliant wash of color reaching from the middle of her hips to the light pink fringes lining the trailing edge of her flukes.

"Sorry," she said playfully, buoyed by the sight of her own tail. "I keep forgetting how long this thing actually is."

She turned back to her steam-punk microscope, forcing her tired eyes to look through the small lens. There, in the tiny eyepieces, she watched hundreds of tiny, squiggling, spiraling, and squirming microorganisms come into focus. She could feel Phoebe shift over to her right side to prepare their next slide. The four of them had been working steadily for several hours through the dark of the night, returning to work shortly after the orgy that followed Kate and Ann's transition, poring through the mountain of data they had collected.

She watched again, as the microscopic creatures absorbed the mineral salts, which Phoebe had dyed blue, into their bodies then began to disaggregate them. She watched amazed, until realizing she wasn't breathing and leaned back with a sigh.

Incredible, she thought to herself rubbing her tired eyes again. The microorganisms in the Moon Pool were literally creating the raw materials they had used during their transition from human to mer. The siren cells could, and had, done it on their own, but it had taken weeks to build up enough mass and energy to accomplish the task. The microorganisms' activity accounted for both the increased speed of the more recent transformations and the otherwise unexplainable increases in everyone's body mass and density. The microorganisms may have been a significant factor in their unbelievable luck in achieving the genetic stability they enjoyed. Well, she reminded herself, they now knew how much their bio-electro-magnetic mer-organs affected the transformations, which was considerable.

"Next," she said, flexing her tail, trying to work out the stiffness she felt as she propped herself up before the microscope. Phoebe removed the current slide and replaced it with another. Pat leaned back into the powerful apparatus and looked again. After a few minutes she began to dictate.

"They are processing and breaking down minerals and salts in the water," Pat reported as Phoebe typed notes into her computer. "They disaggregate inorganic compounds into elements and, as a byproduct, gain materials for their own reproduction. Additional waste products are organic compounds that our siren cells use to rebuild tissue and bone."

"They breed while creating the raw materials for our transformations?" Phoebe confirmed while typing furiously.

"Yes," Pat agreed. "It looks to be both a bio-chemical and an electromagnetic process, much like Rose does when she creates polymers. Galina, what does your data suggest?"

"A few of these microorganisms are converting mass into energy on a quantum scale, a process which seems to follow fractal patterns," Galina reported, her voice tinged with awe. "It's similar to how our cells follow DNA instructions, which-like any fractal—are repeating patterns resonating across a structure. But these conversions are happening on a scale too small for our equipment to measure, and their energy traces seem to suggest a dual process, and perhaps that second one causes our non-genetic expressions, like hydrophobic skin and hair."

"Possible," Pat agreed. "But we can't see them, and I would bet that even Geneva's accelerator can't see them either. So, we're not going to know the answer to that question for a while."

"Maybe the second process is not quantum, but rather an unusual biological process we can't see?" Phoebe suggested.

"We'd see otherwise unexplainable biological waste," Galina argued. "No biological system is completely efficient. Even though we have very efficient biological systems as mermaids, we do not use all our calories for cellular survival."

"It means we still poop," Pat said.

"I know what that means," Phoebe said with a pout.

"And the processes don't seem to operate like biological agents," Alexis observed. "They aren't bacteria, or they aren't any longer at any rate, AND they aren't viruses. They appear to be acting very differently. Perhaps it's a radical mutation of bacteria."

"Mutation?" Pat asked, salamandering over Phoebe's tail and circling around the table to their computer.

"The residual radioactivity on this island has created instabilities in the DNA of some creatures," Alexis offered. "We may have been affected by this phenomenon ourselves, except in a good way. We were created by a rare combination of bio-electromagnetic forces in both our human and siren DNA. Our resultant DNA is unusually stable, thus our long life expectancy, but these micro-organisms are highly unstable."

"What about those DNA packets inside those micro-organisms?" Pat asked, pointing at the computer screen.

"Those viral packets?" Galina asked.

Pat nodded.

"It's a match," Galina said.

"How much?" Pat asked, feeling her tail cramp beneath her.

"Um, give me a minute," Galina said, twisting to another computer to her right. Her long, graceful fingers flew over the keyboard, typing furiously.

"We should work on an interface between our tiara's and computers," Alexis said, watching her former fellow Russian scientist work. "We could really speed some things up."

Galina's hands were a blur over the keyboard, and after several minutes of entering data and activating complex computations, she straightened up.

"It's actually unbelievable," Galina reported.

"Are you kidding?" Pat sighed. "After all we've been through already, you think you've discovered something unbelievable? A compound I distilled from painted shellfish changes me into a girl, then Danni," she said nodding at the pool where the rest of the mers were still sleeping, "then it changed all of us into mermaids, including two stranded Russian men. Now, you tell me we've found something incredible?"

"The micro-organisms that carry this particular virus comprise at least fifty different species," Galina reported, lifting her head from the computer screen, her bright red hair falling back from her face, curling over her very large breasts.

"We confirmed that last week," Alexis added, her blue eyes sparkling with excitement.

"And they each perform very specific and very different activities during transformation," Galina continued.

"Which we also knew last week," Pat reminded her.

"But, what we didn't know is that they all carry the exact same, identical virus," Galina said, her hand sweeping over the data on the other computer screen. "Which is itself an exact match for our siren cells."

"Exact?" Pat asked, salamandering over Alexis' bright pink tail and sidling next to Galina's dark maroon one.

"Exact," Galina reported, pointing to her computer screen.

"I believe you," Pat said, peering at the columns of glowing numbers. "I just don't believe the data. Over three billion possible, and probable, variations, and there are no variations."

"It is exact?" Phoebe asked.

"Exact," Galina repeated in the same tone.

"Exact?" Alexis asked.

"That was three times, it's not funny any more," Pat sighed. "So, it's exact. The micro-organisms carry the DNA for siren cells in a viral form."

"Does that mean that they can actually make them," Alexis asked. "Like we do in our own bodies?"

"I would think so, but only after they are inserted into human cells," Galina argued. "Remember those nasty little bugs we created for the Rous sarcoma virus a few years ago?"

"Don't remind me," Alexis protested. "They almost killed us."

"Well, these lipid packets are morphologically identical," Galina observed. "Except that now the result is a siren cell rather than a deadly cancer."

"Or so we hope," Alexis said.

"Wait," Pat said, a sudden inspiration taking her. "These microbes are performing both biological and electrochemical changes in materials around them as they infect living material in order to breed, right?"

"Basically," Galina agreed.

"Can we leverage those functions towards purely electrochemical ones and have the biological ones create the energy?" Pat asked.

"You mean, use the biological energies that are now waste driven to power more electrochemical disaggregation?" Alexis asked.

"Oh, my goodness," Galina agreed. "Maybe. We could, but what would we do with that process?"

"Disaggregate sea water," Pat said.

"We could do it," Alexis said, her dark blue eyes suddenly growing bright with fear.

"Do what?" Phoebe asked, looking around the dim lab cave to see if everyone else was still asleep in the pool at the far end of the cavern.

"Create a bio-electrical organism that can metabolize or disaggregate base molecules into elements, which would cause them procreate at exponential speeds," Galina answered. "We could turn seawater into a gas."

"Oh, god," Phoebe said. "Could we?"

"While it's theoretically possible," Galina said. "I'm still not sure if it is desirable."

"We must," Alexis said. "We cannot allow what we have created to be lost. I lost two pod-mates once to human greed and ignorance. I have no wish to lose another. We must do this."

"But these micro-organisms are inside Mac and Joy," Phoebe said. "If they are so unstable, what are we going to do for them?"

"I don't know," Pat said softly. "I don't know."

John awoke slowly, his eyes blinking through the thick cloud of golden blond hair blocking his view. As he struggled to focus past the swirling mass of hair, he became aware of his long penis, still hard, and still buried in a mermaid. Blond hair ... long, stiff nipples pressed into his chest ... a soft, fluttery tail quivered along his own ... it must be Danni he concluded, still feeling groggy.

He closed his unhelpful eyes and let the sensual brush of Danni's soft fringes along the trailing edge of her flukes wash over his tail, his own flukes and pelvic fins beginning to quiver with passion. He felt his CHEW focus on Danni's, and hers grew brighter as she stirred towards wakefulness. His long penis twitched within Danni's warm womb, and she stirred, nuzzling her face into his neck.

"Ummmm," she moaned, out loud. [You're still inside me. I love waking up like this,] she sent to him via their CHEW.

"Ahhhhh," he agreed, out loud.

[I sometimes wish I was always last,] she thought to him softly.

John jerked his head up and stole a quick look around, worried that Pat and Phoebe were still in the water, able to hear Danni's CHEW. He halfconsciously knew they had left the small pool filling one corner of the Lab Cave, but he wanted to make sure. He sensed his three daughters behind him, cuddled together with Petra's daughter Michelle, Xing's daughter Bao, and Liga's daughter Mair. The six infant mermaids were curled in a small ball in the very center of the pool. He noticed that Alexis had left Eric, Sally, and Liga behind, and that Galina was missing from Gabriel's pod. He smiled to himself; the four scientists were back at work, before anyone else had stirred, and two of them were his pod-mates.

The mermaid-scientists had collected a lot of data the previous evening when Kate and Ann transitioned into mermaids. Watching the data scroll down the computer screens had been amazing, seeing each step of the transformation represented in graphic shifts and jumps in the numbers as they raced by. He wondered what time it was, and he lifted his head to search for the pinhole of light from just above the cave entrance that would indicate that the sun had risen, but no spark of light was visible. The lights from the lab softly glowed, but it was still dark outside. He could barely sense Phoebe and Pat, hovering with Galina and Alexis over a computer along the back wall. They would not be able to sense Danni's words.

[At least you get me to yourself when there's science to be done,] remarked John. [Pat and Phoebe are already back at work.]

[Do you think they discovered anything new last night?] Danni asked as she began to move slightly against John's hips, forcing his penis to wag back and forth within her.

"Uuuuaaaahhhh," John sighed out loud, responding to Danni's movements. [I think it might still be last night; I can't yet see the morning sun in the peephole. One thing that we did learn was that the compulsion to mate after transformation travels at least as far as the distance between the Moon Pool and the Lab cave. God, that was overwhelming!]

[Overwhelming?] Danni asked, beginning to move her hips along the length of John's cock, her breathing quickening.

[It just caught ... ahhh ... me by surprise because we weren't officially "in" on the transition,] he explained. [I didn't think it would affect ... ahhh ... us since we weren't in the pool with them.]

[Yeah,] she agreed. [I can't ... ummmm ... believe that Ann's and Kate's pheromones ... oohhh ... traveled that far, that fast. God, you feel so good inside me,] Danni mentally sighed. She closed her eyes, savoring the thick fullness that John's long cock created in her belly. She could feel their tails twisted together, her flukes resting just at the joint between tail and fluke on John, and she ran her fingers along the transitional line between his nearly translucent flukes and his denser knob at the base of his tail. John shivered as she stroked him.

[Actually, Pat's early hypothesis just before we tumbled into this pool ... yes ... to join you was that it wasn't pheromones because our children weren't yet affected. They only started getting sleepy after ... ahhh ... after we started. Pat thought it was our CHEW, and so I guess our CHEW is more complicated than anyone guessed,] John said, as he stroked Danni's long hair away from her face. [Not only are pods bound to one another, but all mers are some how connected with each other.]

Danni wrapped her tail more tightly around John's and pressed herself tightly into her mate, her generous breasts pressed up and out as she ground herself into his darkly shimmering tail, the faint flickering of their bioluminescence now visible. [I love being connected with you,] she said as she nipped and kissed at his chin.

[What's gotten into you?] John teased.

"You! You've gotten into me," Danni mused out loud as she pressed herself into her mate. [Mermaids get horny all the time, even when it's not transformation.]

[Right,] John said, remembering. [Like when you girls watched Phoebe with Petra and Esme with Trixi; you all got uncontrollably horny despite the fact that there was no transformation.]

[But it wasn't like the transformations; it wasn't a compulsion,] Danni noted as she starting moving her hips with more vigor, savoring the feeling of John's thick penis head moving against her G-spot. [It was more ... ahhhhh ... like this.]

[What is this,] asked John, grabbing her pelvic fins and helping her move back and forth along his stiff cock.

[This is just regular, I love you, horny,] she gasped as her breasts began to leak milk into the water and her abdomen started twitching.

[I love regular, I love you, horny,] John agreed as Danni thrashed out a morning orgasm, clutching at his cock as her womb spasmed around him. He waited until she stopped shaking, and then leveraged his own tail against hers and started to stroke strongly in and out of her.

[There is nothing regular about the way you make me feel,] Danni groaned, feeling her body begin another journey towards a second orgasm.

John smiled, wrapped his long tail one more loop around hers, and began to go faster.

Rose hung onto Tutu as the young female dolphin propelled them both through the water, not nearly as fast as Rose could go by her self, but that wasn't the point. They were playing. With MuSu and the Henderson triplets gone on the rescue mission, Snort's pod had attached themselves to the next best thing: Trevor's pod. Tutu twisted up towards the surface, and Rose matched the dolphin's strokes, adding to their combined speed and power. Together, they burst from the water, turning in the air, both of them squealing with delight. Rose slapped her black and red flukes on Tutu's gray and white ones, pushing them apart so they fell back into the water separately. They both executed another flip, Rose's long, dark hair brushing Tutu as they turned past one another just before hitting the water.

Two deep and rich "kerthwoumps" resonated in the water while two perfect geysers whooshed up towards the morning sky. Rose giggled with childish satisfaction as she tumbled under the water. She had never been able to do a can-opener dive quite like that back when she was a little boy, she thought to herself. She righted herself in the water, and swam back for the surface.

"It's only a 5.1," Kate said sagely.

"Only a 5.1?" Rose protested. "Are you kidding? That was nearly perfect!"

"I thought it was beautiful," Ann said. "Tutu especially," she said as the latter surfaced and squirted water at her face. "Such a good girl!" Ann gushed, rubbing the dolphin's proffered nose.

"Tutu gets a 5.9," Kate said.

"Tutu?" Rose protested. "Why do you always have to be the Russian judge?"

"Because I'm the youngest, and you're the oldest," Kate answered.

"Trevor?" Rose whined.

"6.0," He said, calmly, one arm draped over Snort, who also looked on without much interest.

"Ha!" Rose said.

"Whatever," Kate said. "He'll say anything to get laid."

"He always gets laid," Ann said. "It's three to one, the lucky bastard."

"Are you feeling neglected?" Trevor asked, a note of seriousness creeping into his voice.

"No, no," Ann said. "I was just pointing out to the young child here that you were giving an honest opinion as to Rose's skill."

"I was," he said.

"It was not a 6.0," Kate argued. "She didn't get further than two meters out of the water."

"Let's see what you've got," Rose challenged.

"Fine," Kate smiled, and then whistled with her fingers and lips.

"I could never do that," Rose complained, trying again to master that essential childhood skill. She blew through her fingers at all kinds of angles, with no luck.

Mumu rolled up beside Kate, waving a flipper at her newest friend. Kate reached over, gently held Mumu's dorsal fin and drifted onto her back as they both swam away from the pod. Kate loved the feeling of her new body slicing through the water. There was so much that was new, so much that was wonderful. The warmth of Mumu's body undulating next to hers, the feeling of her hair fluttering along her shoulders and back, the way her fins cut through the water, creating eddies of sensation along the sides of her tail, and the incredible feeling of power she got from her wide flukes whenever she pushed against the water with them.

She kicked a strong stroke, sending both her and Mumu towards the bottom, the dolphin understanding the trick they were to perform. As they plunged downwards, Kate noticed how her larger breasts had tightened up on her chest, offering less resistance to the water. She pushed harder with her tail, urging Mumu to go faster, feeling her pelvic fins leverage each stroke of her flukes like a fulcrum. She was aware of her elbow fins constantly adjusting the flow of water, guiding both her and the dolphin along a straight trajectory. She pulled herself closer to Mumu's back, and together they twisted towards the surface. Kate reversed her grip on Mumu's dorsal fin, pulling the dolphin rather than being pulled by her. She added more power to her strokes, and pushed them both towards the surface.

"Wow," Rose said without envy as she watched her sister-wife and their pet explode from the water.

Kate pushed Mumu's dorsal fin to her left, causing her to spin in the opposite direction, and then—as they twisted past each other—she curled her longer tail under the dolphin's flukes, lifting Mumu higher and starting each of them on a flip away from one another. Kate's timing sent both of them spinning madly, once, twice, three, four times around, nearly out of control, and then "Ka-thawap!" The water shattered away from her as she smacked the surface with the full length of her body.

Ouch, Kate thought, that stung.

"Uh-oh," Rose said.

"Yea, that will leave a mark," Ann said, trying not to giggle.

Kate turned her now tingling body towards the surface, but let herself sink for a bit, watching the sun play on the surface of the water. How could something so pretty hurt so much, she thought. She noticed a slightly disoriented Mumu being tended to by Snort, who had rushed to her side. She wished Trevor had the sense to see if she was O.K.

[Hey, you O.K.?] Trevor asked, appearing as if by magic at her side, startling her.

[Mostly,] she answered after she composed herself.

[Good,] he said, looking her over carefully, using his CHEW to see beyond the surface of things. [It looks like the only thing you hurt was your pride.]

[That's what you think,] she said. [That belly-flop hurt.]

[Everyone does it at least once,] Trevor said encouragingly. [It actually takes a while to really get used to your new tail. I mean, you're doing great, but super fine motor skills only come with practice. Come on, you can't hide down here forever. Let's get back to Rose and Ann.]

[How did you sneak up on me?] she asked as they both headed for the surface.

[Finely tuned motor skills,] he answered.

[Don't believe him,] Rose said, her face back in the water as she listened to their CHEW. [Just like anything else, our CHEW can get rattled if we strain it or our bodies. You were just a bit scrambled. I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself.]

Kate's head broke the surface and the sun seemed a little bright. She blinked several times and slowly everyone came into focus.

"Wow," she said. "That was intense!"

"Yea, but it was only a 3.7," Rose said. "You lost massive points on the re-entry."

"My eyes hurt," Kate complained.

"Let's get you out of the sun," Rose said, her mothering instincts coming out.

The entire pod slowly sank, floating down until they were about five meters below the surface. The water was still bright, but the intensity of the sun was gone. Kate closed her eyes and let her pod surround her.

[I'm sorry,] she sighed.

[Don't even worry about it,] Ann said. [You saved me from making a complete and utter fool out of myself.]

[Well, that's something good,] Kate said, blinking her eyes, trying to shake it off.

[Let's try this,] Rose said as she floated up a bit, positioning her breast in front of Kate's face. [Can't hurt, right.]

Kate looked at the large, beautiful breast before her, the one that had helped propel her towards mermaid hood the previous day. Rose's nipple was already leaking a bit of milk in anticipation of feeding her sister, and Kate was suddenly buoyed by this sign of her sister-wife's care for her. She leaned forward and took the nipple in her mouth.

Rose closed her eyes as the now familiar and sensuous feelings of feeding emanated from her breast. She gathered Kate's long blond hair into her hands and pressed Kate's head to her chest. She felt her milk release, that wonderful rush when her glands let down, and milk began to spray from her other nipple.

[Can't hurt, right?] Ann said as she moved to Rose's other breast and began to suckle.

Kate literally felt her head clearing, while suckling on her sisterwife' s breast. Each gush of warm, sweet milk washed away a bit more of the fog, gently easing the feelings of tightness along her belly and tail. She could feel her sister Ann's tail brush against her own as they both fed from Rose. Then she felt something that surprised her. She felt desire begin to rise from her womb, twitching its way up her belly, and filling her own breasts with milk. She moved from merely suckling Rose's breast to licking, caressing, and kissing her beautiful, life-saving breast.

[Someone is feeling better,] Rose murmured. [You can go right ahead and keep doing that for as long as you like.]

Kate sensed Ann floating away from Rose, sinking below her, then began working her way up Rose's impressive chest towards her neck and face, kissing, licking, and biting her as she went.

[I'm feeling much better,] she said. [Who knew that mermaid milk was good for concussions.]

[It was a belly-flop, not a concussion; you BooBall,] Rose teased.

[You haven't called me BooBall since I was a little kid,] Kate said, her eyes shining with the memory.

[You haven't acted like such a little BooBall in a very long time,] Rose said. [But now, you're mostly grown up, and very lovely. Kiss me.]

Ann looked up from her embrace with Trevor, and saw Rose and Kate's tails were slowly twisting around one another's, their arms now wrapped around each other's torsos. She watched them kiss and stroke each other as the sun sparkled around them, illuminating everything with a pale, green light. Ann moaned as Trevor suckled a little harder on her breasts, earning a bit of milk for himself. She felt the mer-bonds flicker with energy among the four of them, and her heart seemed to grow larger in her chest. She was so happy ... so loved, she thought.

She reached down and pulled Trevor up into a kiss, tasting her own milk on his lips. She felt his cock brush against her vent, and she rolled her hips and felt her top three tail bones, her old thighbones, she remembered, splay out from her pelvic region. It pleasantly reminded her of the feeling she had when she spread her legs when she masturbated. This feeling was very different, however, because her legs were now a mermaid's tail.

Trevor's cock found its way into her now swelling vent, sighing happily as his length steadily oozed into her. She wrapped her own tail around his, and started to work her hips back and forth, feeling the gentle pull of the water as they created suction when he stroked out, and resistance when they squeezed together. The water forced them into a gentle and steady rhythm, which suited Ann just fine. She wanted to enjoy this session, and she was in no hurry to have either herself or Trevor come to an orgasm.

[Harder,] Rose urged her sister-wife. [Ohhhhhh, harder.]

Kate pressed her hand harder into Rose's vent, feeling the hard nub of her clitoris wiggle under her first and second fingers. She slipped the two of them into her sister-wife's vent, curling them up, searching for her G-spot. Kate could feel just the bottom of that sensitive area in mermaid wombs, and she jabbed at it with her fingers, pressing her palm into Rose's clitoris.

[Oh, yes, oh yes, oh yessssssssssssss,] Rose said as an orgasm rippled through her body. She held Kate's head to her shoulder, nuzzling her own nose in her soft, blond hair. She could feel her milk squirt sideways from her breasts that were mashed into Kate's, and she savored the aftershocks of the brief but satisfying release.

[Your turn,] Rose said, lowering her face to Kate's hips, kissing her sister-wife's green and gold tail, working her way down towards the now open vent.

[Yesssssssss,] Kate agreed as Ann and Trevor moaned in orgasms below them.

Leonard Simon patted his belly while pressing it against the railing of the Johanna, a sleek Benetti Super that his partner and client, Michael Thompson, named in honor of his deceased wife. Len's belly grew steadily over the last few years, the product of overwork, a divorce, and advancing age. It was a good belly; his own special friend. He thought of a thousand different ways to lose his belly, but becoming a sea mammal certainly was one he had never considered. He listened to the hollow thump his belly made, while reviewing the circumstances leading up to this moment.

It was complicated, he mused, listening to the water slap the sides of the hull below. He looked up at the evening sky, watching the stars slowly drift across the night sky. The Johanna was heading towards the sometimes sleezy port of Davao, one of the largest cities in the Philippines, but they were still days away. Days enough to consider what Michael had shared with his boat-mates, Liz, Peter, and himself. Days and perhaps even weeks away from making the most monumental decision he had ever faced; the decision to become something other than human, and perhaps, something other than male.

Len sighed and turned away from the sea, feeling the warm salty sea spray against his back as he leaned back on the railing. Michael had shared a tale that could scarcely be believed: mermaids. Mermen too, he reminded himself hastily. But nothing could have prepared him for the way his heart pounded, listening to Michael's tale: his childhood fantasy had suddenly and unexpectedly come to life! He ran his fingers through his still thick brown hair, feeling the salty spray rising up from the bow as it sliced through the warm sea.

Nothing in his life had prepared him for this adventure, so Len felt very much lost, adrift, or ... just simply "at sea;" he softly chuckled to himself at the pun. He turned back to face the dark sea, watching the water roil alongside the boat, the starlight glinting along the tops of the waves churned up by the Johanna's forward progress.

He thought back over his life, the long journey from his relatively innocent mid-western childhood to the somewhat decadent and high-flying lifestyle in which he had landed. The only boats in Ohio were bass fishing boats, riverboats, and the crude rafts he constructed as a young boy on creeks. Now, he represented Michael Thompson's North American operations, multimillion dollar yachts and litigation, both liability and collections, though he operated mostly on the east coast. Michael's business had made him a lot of money, but it had also cost him his marriage.

Leonard winced as he remembered the long, slow separation between he and his wife, Katrina. They met at Duke, where they were both undergrads, and followed her back to New Jersey where he went to law school. It was a struggle at first, but he then met Michael Thompson when he defended Thompson Marine in a product liability claim, and from that point on, his business picked up. But as he traveled more and more, his wife became convinced he was having an affair, and nothing he could do could change her mind. It was true, in a way. His work with Thompson Marine had become his mistress, and though he didn't want to separate, his wife insisted, and they were divorced a year ago. The pain still clutched within his chest when he thought about it.

Michael's announcement a few weeks ago that he was going to sell the business to his sons caught Len by surprise. But that shock was nothing compared to the one he had after Michael made him an offer when he arrived to finalize the new business arrangements with his sons, Brian and Brendan. Rather than keep going with his sons, Michael urged Len sell his practice and join him on an adventure that could change his life. Len had a young partner, after all, who handled his west coast operations, and Michael hinted that Len's childhood fascination with mermaids would be satisfied.

Len looked up at the stars, wondering what that meant: satisfied. Michael couldn't or wouldn't answer his specific questions about how the transformation actually took place, or if he and his fellow passengers would even be allowed to make that ultimate journey. The mystery lying ahead was both frightening and compelling, but Michael had been particularly persuasive. It was a chance to go "off the grid" and be part of building something new, a new society, perhaps, but one existing mostly in the sea. His wife had cast Len off, Michael argued, and he should think about embracing the newfound freedom. The thought of starting over, of really and radically transforming his life was both exciting and terrifying in equal measures.

"Why me?" he asked the night sky softly. "Why now?"

"Why not?" a voice returned softly from the bow, a few meters from where Len stood.

Len cast his glance to the bow, noticing for the first time the silhouetted figure of Liz in her modified wheelchair. She too had her back to the sea, her hair fluttering in the wind as the bow lifted and fell, slicing through the sea.

"Oh, Liz. Are you alright?" Len asked. "Do you need help with the chair? Um, how long have you been up here?" he finished awkwardly.

Elizabeth Wainwright smiled patiently at her new boat mate. Although they had met for the first time a few days ago, she had heard much about Len from Michael over the years. She also had more knowledge about Michael's plans than did either Len or their other boat mate, Peter. Although she had initially thought to wait a few more days before playing her part in Michael's plans, this beautiful evening seemed to be a good opportunity to learn more about Len and plant the seeds of their future together.

"I'm fine, Leonard," she said, letting her chair roll slowly towards him. "I actually get around the boat very well on my own."

"Oh, I didn't mean anyth...." Len protested.

"I know, I know," Liz answered, waving her hand dismissively. "I'm just teasing you. Now, then," she continued as she brought her chair to a stop next to him, "why don't we have a chat and get to know each other," she finished as she nodded her head towards the bulkhead that rose from the middle of the boat.

Len smiled and crossed over to the bulkhead and sat down, so their faces were nearly level with one another. "What would you like to talk about?" he asked.

"Oh, lots of things," Liz answered, "but we don't want to stay out here all night. Let's be frank. I already know a lot about you and how you came to work for Michael, but I don't know much about why he invited you on this adventure."

"You mean the mermaids?" Len asked, blushing.

"Yes," Liz answered. "I'm so glad that you got right to the point."

"How much do you know?" Len asked, leaning forward.

"How much do you know?" Liz returned.

Len looked carefully at Liz, being familiar with this sort of information harvesting from his experience as a trial lawyer. He was pretty sure Liz knew more than he did, but he knew very little about her. He couldn't decide what her game was, but decided to trust her. Michael had at least told him that much, namely that both Peter and Liz were completely trustworthy, old friends. Len decided that honesty was going to be the best policy.

"Not much," he admitted. "Michael told me that we are going on a rescue mission to save some women who were forced into prostitution, then afterwards we would head for an island where there were mermaids, and we probably wouldn't return to civilization when we finished."

"What do you think that really means?" Liz asked.

"What it really means?" Len asked, growing puzzled by this line of questioning.

"Not returning to civilization," she answered.

"Um, that we would stay on the island," he said. "Michael had said all four of us were castaways of a sort, and it would be a good place for castaways."

"Are you ready to become a castaway?" Liz asked.

"I already am a castaway," Len said, turning his head and blinking back an unexpected tear.

"What sort of castaway are you?" Liz asked.

"Oh, the usual sort," Len answered. "I woke up one day, discovering I really didn't have anyone in my life who needed me, nor I them. I had drifted away from my family, my work was just something I did to get by, and I was ... I don't know ... alone." He sat blinking for a few minutes, lost in his thoughts while Liz patiently watched him. After a few minutes, he asked. "What kind of castaway are you?"

"What kind do you think I am?" she countered.

"Well, I hardly know you," he protested.

"Guess," she said, smiling to soften the challenge.

"Well, Michael has been a sort of castaway since his wife died," Len said, trying to watch her face as he put the pieces together. "He never quite recovered from her death all those years ago, but he had two young boys to raise, and so he just soldiered forward. Peter LaMond is another widower, though he was already an old man when his wife died, and my wife left me about a year ago. So, I would guess that your husband left you ... after ... after you ... um," he stuttered as he tried not to look at her withered legs strapped into the wheelchair.

"After I lost my legs?" she helped.

"Did he?" Len exclaimed. "That bastard!"

"Well, I hardly blamed him," Liz explained. "I wanted to die myself. Adjusting to life in a wheelchair is still something I'm fighting to do. But that's not what I want to talk about." She shifted her chair so that she was facing the sea with him. "What do you think will happen after we get to the island?"

"The island?" Len asked, confused.

"The one with the mermaids," she prompted.

"Oh, yes, the mermaids!" Len said. "Oh, my god: mermaids."

"And?" she prodded. "What does that mean for us, do you think?"

"That we might become mermaids?" he offered hesitantly.

Liz smiled to herself at his use of the gender Michael's secret plans called for. "How do you feel about that possibility?"

"Is that what will be happening? Len asked warily. "Is it even possible?"

Liz looked around the deck and seeing no one, she nodded.

"Oh, my god," Len sighed, leaning back into the bulkhead behind him. "Oh. My. God."

"Is that what you want?" Liz asked.

"Oh, my god," Len repeated. "I don't know, but that's what Michael seemed to hint at."

"Would it surprise you to know that Peter is also a lover of mermaids?" Liz asked.

"So was Johanna," Len said, putting together more clues. "She was mad about them, and that's one reason why Michael trusted me with expanding his business. Did you grow up wanting to be a mermaid?" he asked.

"You first," she said. "When did you first become attracted to mermaids?"

"Oh, my god," Len said, searching for a beginning. "I think it was around middle school, maybe 7th or 8th grade."

"What was so special about mermaids?" she prodded after a moment of silence.

"A bunch of things," he began. Liz nodded encouragement, so he continued. "I guess it was the amazing transformation of a woman into a mermaid, and the freedom and seductive nature that they represented."

"You saw them as an escape?" she asked.

"Maybe," he answered as he carefully considered the issue. "The whole transformation thing may have been something to do with puberty, but who knows. I never shared these thoughts, except with one or two trusted friends. I used to sketch drawings in pencil during study hall of a diver removing her equipment under water and transforming into a mermaid. My friends just thought the pictures were cool, sort of sexy."

"But they were something more for you, eh?" Liz asked.

"Yea," he agreed.

"How did it start?" she asked.

"Start?" he asked.

"Book, movie, Hans Christian Anderson?" she indicated.

"Oh, yes. A book," he answered.

"And?" she prompted patiently.

"My cousin got a book for Christmas called "Lucy and the Merman," he explained. "Lucy saves a tiny merman from death, and he transforms her into a tiny mermaid and shows her his world. I snuck the book into the bathroom after Christmas dinner to read it - it was a kids book & too young for me, but I wanted to read it."

"I never read that one," Liz admitted.

"Well, Lucy can turn back into a human as long as she doesn't eat while she's a mermaid," Len continued, warming to the memory. "I always hoped she would have a snack, but she didn't. But there was a second character who had been rescued from a lifeboat during a storm and stayed with the mers. I can't remember her name."

"What happened after puberty?" Liz asked.

"Nothing much," Len continued. "Not until the internet. Then, I realized that there were lots of other people who felt this way, and I started to feel less ... less ... "

"Guilty?" she prompted.

"Ashamed," he countered. "I didn't felt guilty, like I was doing something immoral, it was more like a dirty pleasure. It didn't really hurt anyone, but still, it wasn't NORMAL," he said with some defensiveness.

"What changed?" she asked, searching his face.

"Um, probably when I started writing my own stories," he admitted. "I wrote under a pseudonym, and I only really shared my real name with a few trusted friends, but I still didn't have anyone in real life that I trusted."

"Until Michael," Liz said, smiling.

"Until Michael," Len agreed. "He talked about how Johanna used to dream of being a mermaid, and so I shared my childhood fantasy with him of being one too."

"A mermaid?" she prodded. "Not a merman?"

"I don't know," he shrugged. "Am I supposed to say merman?"

"No," Liz laughed softly. "Not if you want to impress me."

"Do I need to impress you?" he asked.

"Maybe," she teased, looking out at the night sea.

They both watched the sea pass beneath them for a few minutes, enjoying the soft, warm, salty breeze that played across their faces and arms as the boat cruised through the dark waves. The stars twinkled softly in the clear sky, and high above an airplane blinked its way across the star-speckled sky.

"Your turn," Len prompted, turning to look at the attractive, elegant, but obviously handicapped lady next to him. "When did you want to become a mermaid?"

"Never thought about it until a few weeks ago when Michael talked to me about this trip," she answered.

"Never?" Len asked, confused. "I mean, then why are you here?"

Liz waved her hand along her lap and legs, smiling sadly. "You need to ask?"

"Oh, I ... well ... I mean," Len stammered.

"A freak accident robbed me of my legs twenty years ago," she continued softly. "I fell off my horse, and broke my back. I was lucky to be alive, my doctors told me, and they worked really hard to help me. My husband didn't. I've been on my own, more or less, ever since."

"Wow," Len said. "That must have sucked."

"Well, I was rich, and it helped," she laughed. "Hong Kong was a great city for me; I had servants, a great view of harbor, and discretion from my good friends. I've survived, but the chance to be fully healed, to be alive and healthy, to move ... to swim ... to have my personal power back!" She caught herself, checking her emotions.

She folded her hands across her lap and turned back to face Leonard. "I want to have my sense of self back, and even though I've got more money than Bill Gates, it can't buy me my legs back. I want to move on my own, and if it means that I move with a mermaid's tail, then I am good with that."

"You have more money than Bill Gates?" Len asked, deadpan.

"Well, not really, but the Institute for Marine Mammals will be very well endowed," she said with a proud smile, hinting at the pride and strength she hid beneath the blankets that covered her disabled legs.

"The what?" Len asked, surprised.

"Oh, you don't know about that?" she mused. "Well, now. It seems that you have some homework to do. I guess I'll have to tutor you."

"Teach away," Len agreed, leaning in to listen to her, ignoring the dangerous, but beautiful, glint in her eyes.

"The Institute for Marine Mammals can have a mermaid as the director of operations," Janice argued. "It will have a mermaid as director of research! Or are you planning on putting someone other than Pat in charge of the science because it takes a man?"

"Honey, please!" Hank pleaded with his petite but feisty wife. "Let's keep this to ourselves. Quieter."

"Hank!" Janice admonished, lowering her voice slightly. "Will you please take a long hard look at how all the pods operate? There is nothing particularly special about being a merman in terms of how this new society is being organized. In fact, the mermaids are at the center of most of the decision making, and they are inventing both art and science, whereas the mermen are usually at the beck and call of the mermaids. Honey, I'm not attacking you or your maleness; I'm trying to help you see things as they really are around here."

Hank glanced around the beach. A few yards away, but nearly hidden by the steep shadows cast by the evening sun, Janice's sister Julie slept next to her husband Brian, their entwined forms lightly daubed by the still glowing golden sky. Further up towards the tree line and deeper in shadow were Debra Hutchins, James Riddles, and Pat's sister, Bridget clustered in a small puddle of humanity near one of the beach huts, constructed by Alberto and his men. No one was moving.

"Everyone is tired," Janice noted. "They're all asleep. Now will you please talk with me?"

"Harold and Elise aren't asleep," Hank argued.

"Maybe, but they are up at the mountainside huts, finally having a family reunion," she said. "That was a big surprise."

"Yea," Hank sighed.

He remembered the look on Elise's face when she saw her little brother the night before. No one knew that Harold Matthews was related to anyone else, and so while Ann and Kate had transitioned, everyone who was still human worked on unloading the new technical equipment, Hank and crew had brought aboard the Freedom III. Elise recognized her younger brother before he noticed that his older sister was standing on the beach, but both agreed to save the family reunion until after most of the work was accomplished, which took until late in the evening.

Too tired to talk, everyone had fallen asleep on the beach or in the huts straddling the fringe between the jungle and the sandy beach. Early in the morning, everyone returned to work on setting up the new equipment. Even Dr. Riddles, who was quite elderly, helped with a variety of tasks, from repairing the mountainside huts, to running wires across the landscape for new monitors, sensors, and controls for booby traps, the naval gun, and new solar panels. Amazingly, the nine humans had been very successful, finishing most of the jobs they thought would take several days in only one. It meant that those who wished could transition sooner, rather than later. And that speeded up time table was the cause of Hank's unease.

"I know you feel rushed," Janice continued. "But we really do have to make this decision. We can start transitioning tomorrow."

"I just don't know how I can ... can ... submit to Brian," Hank explained.

"Perhaps your son can help you," Janice said.

"My son?" Hank exclaimed. "I no longer have a son."

"Correct. You have another daughter," Rose said softly from her hidden position halfway up the beach.

Hank turned quickly and saw his former son salamander up the beach towards the spot Janice had insisted they occupy. He turned to his wife. "You set this up," he said simply.

"I only want what is best for all concerned," Janice said softly. "Really, Hank. You must believe me."

"Dad," Rose interrupted as she drew closer. "What's your problem?"

"What do you mean MY PROBLEM?" Hank demanded.

"Um, Mom said you were afraid of becoming a mermaid," Rose said.

"Afraid, huh?" Hank challenged.

"Why else are you putting up such a fuss?" Janice asked.

"Changing both my species AND my gender was not part of my plans," Hank protested.

"Nor mine," Rose said, reaching out to her father. "But I wouldn't change that now. Not for anything."

"How can you be so sure?" Hank asked, taking her soft, small hand in his own, feeling the webbing in between her fingers.

Rose sighed, and then caught her mother's eye and lifted an eyebrow.

"Ah," Janice said. "Wow, I've got to go to the little girl's room. I'll be back in a bit," she finished as she rose to her feet. She glanced down at her husband, still a fit man despite his age, and wondered if she was really as sure as she thought she was. Her newest daughter smiled up at her, Rose's perfectly white teeth gleaming in the dusk, her dark hair cascading over her shoulders and across her impressive breasts. Rose radiated health, happiness, and a hidden power. Janice drew strength from her daughter's presence.

"Maybe I'll take a walk afterwards," Janice added. "I might not get the chance to do that very often in the future, eh?"

"Mom," Rose groaned. "Go pee."

"How un-ladylike," Janice teased as she walked towards the trees.

"I'm still learning how to be a lady," Rose countered.

Both father and daughter/mermaid laughed softly, watching Janice make her way silently into the trees, disappearing into the darkening foliage.

"A lady?" Hank asked.

"A mermaid is still a lady," Rose said.

"Do you miss it?" Hank asked.

"Being a boy?" Rose asked.

"No," he added. "Walking," he gestured towards the dark hole in the woods where Janice disappeared.

"Not really," Rose said after a moment's thought. "First, there is nothing that can explain the power and grace I feel when I'm in the water. It's like ... spacewalking and time travel all rolled into one. It's so amazing to be able to just ... be ... just be in and of the water."

"That sounds like a mystical experience," Hank joked.

"It is, I guess," Rose agreed. "But, it is strange to spend so much time on dry land basically lying on the ground. But we can still stand up, though it's not comfortable, and we can salamander faster than some people can run. I guess we just get used to it."

"What about the being a man part?" Hank asked.

"It didn't take any getting used to," Rose said. "It just happened."

"Tell me about it," Hank urged.

"Well, first of all, Mom is right," Rose declared, shifting her pelvis so she could wrap her tail behind her father, a mermaid equivalent to putting your arm around someone. "Mermaids really are in charge."

"This isn't about being in charge for me," Hank argued. "It's never been about being in charge."

"I know," Rose agreed. "If it wasn't for Mom, you'd never have been a successful businessman."

"Hey, now," Hank said smiling at the old family joke.

"Well, it's true," Rose said. "Mom gave you a backbone you don't normally possess. It's not that you're weak, it's just that you are naturally gentle, and sometimes that can get you into trouble in the business world."

"Look how the undergraduate art major talks now," Hank teased.

"Just because I studied art doesn't mean I don't understand people," Rose said seriously. "Sometimes, I think it helped me understand people better. But, I'm not answering your question, am I?"

"No," Hank agreed, letting his left arm rest on Rose's flukes as they curled along his left leg. Her red tail still glinted against the dark sand, catching the last rays of the glowing horizon. Her black fringes were barely visible against the sand. "I'm actually not sure which is more terrifying, changing gender or changing species."

"I thought you wanted this?" Rose asked, surprised.

"Your mother is the reason for that," Hank said sheepishly. "I want what she wants. Really. I would do almost anything for that woman, and I don't know why this is only just now making me crazy."

"Becoming a girl really isn't bad," Rose started.

"No, it's not just about being a girl, really. I guess every one wonders what it would be like, you know?" Hank said. "I mean, I think every one must think about that at one time in their life."

"Oh, yes," Rose agreed, giggling. "I thought about it more than once, and I don't know of anyone who didn't at least wonder what it would be like to have your own set of breasts. Remember that old joke?"

"Yes," Hank agreed, relaxing. "It's a good thing men don't have breasts, otherwise they'd never leave the house."

"So, what's the problem?" Rose asked. "Are you afraid of becoming a mer?"

"No. It's not that I'm afraid of becoming a mer," he answered. "It's just that I'm not eagerly in favor of it. In fact, it puzzles me why everyone else seems to be so gung ho."

"Well, it puzzles me why anyone who sees a mer isn't gung ho," Rose said. "And now that I am one, I can tell you that there is nothing to compare it to. I feel healthier, happier, and hornier than I have ever felt before."

"Horny?" Hank asked, trying to ignore his daughter's large breasts as they bobbled beneath her dark hair.

"Well, yes, horny," Rose said with finality. "But it's not like the guilt ridden, never-quite-appropriate-horny like when I was young. It's a good horny now."

"What is a good horny?" Hank asked. "Is this a girl thing?"

"No, it's not a girl thing," Rose said. "At least that isn't what Trevor says. He likes the way he is horny now too, but it's hard to explain. Don't you still get sexually excited with Mom?"

"Robbie, er ... Rose!" Hank exclaimed. "We've never talked about such things before."

"Dad," Rose said patiently. "Mers are different. We have sex all the time, and usually in front of someone else. Now answer the question. Do you still get horny?"

"Yes," he answered reluctantly. "Your mother is still the love of my life. She is very successful at ... um."

"Getting you horny," Rose said. "Good."

"I'm not dead, you know," he protested.

"I know people are supposed to lose some of their libido as they get older, but that never happened to me," Rose said. "I've been constantly horny since I was twelve, so it's good to hear that you can still get horny."

"Can we use a different term?" Hank asked, shifting uncomfortably, trying to adjust his bathing suit.

"Dad, relax!" Rose chided. "Horny is good. Makes you feel alive, alert."

"And the world needs more alerts," Hank said, trying to deflect the topic.

"Ha, ha," Rose said. "There's nothing to be afraid of, Dad. Merman or mermaid, you'll be fine."

"Why does your mother think I should be a mermaid?" he asked.

"She wants you to be her sister-wife," Rose explained. "Even though Trevor loves me, and I love him, there is a bond among Kate, Ann, and I that goes beyond that somehow."

"What is so special about being a sister-wife?" Hank asked.

"That," Rose sighed, "I can't explain. I guess that is something of a girl thing."

"Did you secretly want to be a girl?" Hank asked.

"No," Rose said simply. "I really just wanted to be a mer, both Trevor and I did. It was like a compulsion, almost. That's why I'm so confused as to why you are reluctant."

"Well, what is it about the mers that was so compelling?" Hank asked.

"You don't see anything?" Rose asked, unbelieving.

"I can see that they are beautiful, powerful creatures," Hank said. "I'm not blind. But I must be missing something. What made you want to become a mermaid?"

"I didn't want to be a mermaid," Rose corrected him. "I wanted to be a mer, but I wasn't afraid of becoming mermaid, and neither was Trevor. We both took the chance that we would be the one to change into a girl, but it didn't seem like it was a big danger. The point was to become a mer, and we welcomed the certainty that one of us would also change our gender; it was part of the excitement."

"Tell me how it happened," Hank said, turning away from his daughter's eyes and scanning the dark sea.

"Well, we first had three feedings, one from Pat and Danni, who were pregnant at the time, so their milk was strong, and then from Emma and Cleo, and last from Petra and Galina," Rose said, her breathing changing as she remembered her transition.

"All in one day?" he asked.

"More or less," she answered.

"Go on," Hank urged, still not looking at his daughter.

"They gave us a final feeding in two canteens, one that was just mermaid milk, and one that had both milk and semen," Rose continued, her breathing growing more deliberate and heavy. "Then we were left alone so one of us could physically dominate the other one. We decided on a wrestling match. It didn't last long, and once Trevor pinned me, it was over in seconds."

"Over?" Hank asked.

"I changed ... inside," Rose continued, searching for words. "My mind changed. My body took a bit longer, I don't really remember how long exactly, but not too long because we had done four feedings, and the time it takes for the siren cell to work depends on how many of them are in your body."

"Your mind changed?" Hank asked.

"The siren cell changed me, and it was actually quite pleasurable," Rose answered. "You know, I just felt different the moment I turned. That's what we call it, turning. It happened to Pat and Liga and Sandi and Danni and ..."

"I get the picture," Hank interrupted. "What exactly is that like, turning?" he finished turning back to face his daughter, searching her face as she talked.

"It's hard to describe," Rose said. "But it was so ... fulfilling."

"Go on," Hank said.

"Everything made sense," Rose continued. "Sights, smells, Trevor's body, my own body, everything just ... fit. I felt ... complete, even though I didn't feel incomplete before."

"Complete?" Hank prompted. "What about Kate and Ann?"

"It's strange," Rose said. "When Trevor and I changed, it felt complete. When Kate and Ann changed and joined us, it felt complete in a different way. I guess there's a sort of evolution to completeness."

"Are you done, are you complete?" Hank asked.

"Yes," Rose said. "I am happier and more ... I don't know ... connected, satisfied, you know, in love. But ... " Rose stopped talking and was lost in thought for several seconds.

"But what?" Hank asked.

"But now I can feel something else," Rose answered. "It's not like a need, I don't need this to be happy or complete. It's more like a desire. I'm happy, and so I desire it."

"Desire what?" Hank asked.

"To create a new life," Rose breathed.

"You want to get pregnant?" Hank asked, shocked.

"Isn't that amazing?" Rose answered.

"But you're just a kid," Hank protested. "Heck, you've only been a girl for ... what, two and a half months?"

"Actually, the mers don't feel any particular age," Rose argued. "Remember, some of us were old, some were young, but the siren cell makes it so adults change into more or less the same physical age and abilities. Even Kate and Ann can feel the difference."

"They want to become pregnant too?" Hank exclaimed.

"Dad, relax!" Rose gently chided him again. "They don't want to become pregnant yet, but you'll understand more when you're a mer."

"If I become a mer!" Hank said, only half kidding. "Have you talked to Trevor about a child?"

"No," Rose said.

"But ... but ... but?" Hank sputtered. "Do you even care how Trevor feels about it?

"He feels devoted," Rose giggled coyly, blushing.

"Seriously," Hank admonished.

"He's seriously devoted," Rose said, straightening up. "Really, this is part of the completeness I've been trying to tell you about. I can feel it ... him ... Kate and Ann ... us ... our bond ... all the time. He might be stronger than we are, quicker than we are, and bigger than we are, but we are in charge, and I know it. If I want a child, then he has got nothing to say about it."

"Seriously, you'd do that to him?" Hank asked.

"No, I'd tell him," Rose said. "But he would do what ever I wanted, that's my point. What ever I asked."

"You're sure?" Hank asked.

"Absolutely," Rose stated.

"Your sisters?" Hank asked.

"Them too," Rose said with confidence. "Every mermaid can feel it. It's more than just love, it's the CHEW and who knows what else. Mermen are devoted to their mermaids. They are almost helpless about it, really. It's different than with Kate and Ann, and their love is every bit as real and wonderful as Trevor's. But every time I feel Trevor's eyes upon me, I can feel it as strongly as the first time we made love. It makes me feel really, really, special. Like, TOTALLY loved."

Hank studied Rose's face and noted the clear and unmistakable expression of that love, of that warmth infusing every aspect of her face, her eyes, her voice, and her body. It was like a flash of lightening, a sudden clarity of vision that had been blocked from him for all this time. He could see "it," he realized for the first time, "it" was the thing that made the mers so compelling, seductive, and attractive to anyone who saw them. They were completely, totally, absolutely, and amazingly happy. The enormity of it was staggering. He drew his breath in sharply and sat up, seized by a new question.

"You're not afraid?" he asked.

"Of what?" Rose asked, unaware of her father's change.

"Of losing this most precious of gifts?" he continued. "What would it be like to lose that love?"

"DAD!" Rose said fiercely, through clenched teeth, trying to keep quiet. "Really! You're talking about Trevor or your own daughters being killed!"

"That's not my point," Hank argued. "It could happen to anyone, and it did happen to Liga and Alexis. It's a fair question."

"Yes, it did happen, though none of us were here on that terrible day," Rose agreed. She thought the unthinkable for a few minutes, feeling her stomach fall into a black pit of fear that she had never before faced. She fought back a tear, then turned back to her father.

"It would be awful, of course," Rose said, regaining her composure. "But that is such a male thing to say. It may even be a human thing to say."

"What do you mean by that?" Hank asked.

"Everyone wants to be loved, right?" Rose answered, finally seeing the answer clearly. "And many people are sometimes afraid of the very thing they actually desire. It's sad really. I suppose we call it merbonding for a reason. Maybe we're not human any longer. Yes, Liga and Alexis lost their pod-mates, but they recovered, more than recovered, in fact, by joining with Eric and Sally. We cannot help it; we must bond. We are mers. It is our nature to bond. We must be connected."

Hank's jaw dropped. He had missed so much, and the clues were there the entire time. The mers were happy, a happiness most people could never achieve because they could not--or would not--give themselves completely to the bonds of love. But for mers, such willingness was a natural part of the basic instincts of being a mer. Mer bonding went far beyond human bonding, and he now realized that THAT was what he wanted--no needed! This was a Shangri-La for all humanity: to be loved, completely, powerfully, and with the great certainty that such a bond was made of more than mere emotion and promise. Mer-love was made from the very stuff of their minds, their bodies, their cells, and their "souls."

Hank just wondered if he could actually pay the price his wife was asking of him.

Mark, Wong and MuSu floated, unmoving, in the shallow water along the edge of the dropoff, beyond which the sea floor plunged into the darkness below. They were waiting for the shark they could already sense below them to appear; each gripped a Bowie knife. The pods had stopped at this small seamount to collect shellfish and seaweed and get a few days rest. Their tasks were interrupted when the mermen sensed a very large shark approaching them quickly from below. Suddenly, the blunt nose of a Great White shark appeared at the edge of the dropoff, then swung towards a school of tuna a few hundred meters away. The mermen watched warily as the nearly two-ton shark turned and continued swimming away from them.

They had spent the morning collecting food along the sides of this small seamount that had a very small atoll breaking through the waves, only a few meters wide. Recent volcanic activity could be seen everywhere, but the waters were teeming with life, and their food supplies had dipped after nearly twelve days of constant swimming through deep ocean. They were over half way towards their goal of Davao, but they had to stop, rest, and resupply. They needed all the energy they could muster for their mission to find and rescue the triplet's mother. Their harvesting was interrupted when they had sensed the shark a few seconds earlier.

[What do you think?] Mark asked via his CHEW.

[She can sense CHEW!] MuSu answered as the shark turned back sharply towards them, picking up speed.

[She's quick!] Wong gasped as the shark rocketed towards them, its intentions clear.

[Bottom, two sides!] Mark directed to MuSu and Wong, each immediately understanding what he meant. They moved slightly away from Mark, each of them prepared to slash at the shark from each side as it attacked Mark.

[DIE YOU SEA BITCH!] Mark shouted with his CHEW, pointing his knife directly at the shark now moving with great speed towards them.

[AHAAAAAAAAAAAAA!] MuSu and Wong joined in the mental shouting at the shark, using their knives to focus their CHEW on the animal.

Suddenly, only a few meters away from the mermen, the shark twisted its body violently, spiraling to the right, apparently losing control. The shark began twitching in random patterns, each movement without fluidity or connection to any other action, like swimming. After a few horrifying seconds, the shark simply stopped moving, other than the quivering of one pectoral fin. A few seconds more, and the now completely still body of the hulking, gray creature began floating slowly towards the surface.

[What did we just do?] Mark asked.

[I think we killed it,] MuSu answered.

[I know that,] Mark continued. [How did we kill it?]

[I don't care,] Wong said, keeping his knife pointing at the shark.

[I'm not sure, but Great Whites have some of the most sensitive electroreceptors of any shark,] MuSu recounted, relying on his mer-bonds to Emma's knowledge.

[I'm guessing that our CHEW sent a so highly concentrated and focused electromagnetic field towards the shark, it totally disrupted their "ampullae of Lorenzini."]

[Ampullae?] asked Wong.

[The system of electromagnetic sensors in a shark's body,] MuSu explained. [It's a lot like our own mer-organs. If we sent enough energy into such a creature, we might have scrambled the poor beast's brain.]

[We mind-fried a Great White?] Mark asked, blinking at the lifeless body now nearly level with their own, dramatically smaller ones.

[I guess so,] MuSu answered.

[I think you're right,] Emma answered, sliding up next to her mate.

[Nos héros merveilleux!] Esmée exclaimed as she gave a horrified look at the shark that was larger than her entire pod combined.

[Well, we can have protein supplies for a few days, if we prepare this meat,] Mark said, putting his knife back into its holster on the utility belt around his waist. [I wish we could smoke or salt this meat, but we don't have time. We can worry about the science later, because other predators will come once we start hacking away on this shark. Let's get cracking.]

The twelve mers surrounded the dead Great White shark, then began maneuvering it towards the small atoll above. The silver, gray, red, gold, blue, orange, purple, yellow, and white splashes of color swirled around the grey and white shark, making it look dull rather than deadly.

[Wow, this thing weighs a ton,] Trixi exclaimed, pushing with Homa on the underside of the shark.

[Two tons, actually,] Emma said.

[MuSu, how did you know it was a female shark?] asked Mark.

[You better not say because she was fat,] warned Rikki with a grin.

[I knew she was female because she was unafraid and in charge,] MuSu answered enigmatically.

[Female sharks are usually larger than males,] Emma explained to Mark. [But it doesn't mean that they are fatter,] she finished with a nod to her sister.

[I like MuSu's answer better,] Mark said, winking at his own girls.

Harold Matthews leaned back in the hot tub, tugging at his shorts he was wearing for the first time. For the past few weeks, he had always been alone when lounging in this beautiful perch halfway up the side of the volcano. Tonight, his older sister shared the hot tub with him.

"You like the view?" he asked, looking out over the horizon, watching the last of the setting sun dip below the ocean.

"It's more beautiful than I imagined," Elise Matthews answered.

"So ... " Harold began, but then fell silent.

"So ..." Elise agreed.

They sat in silence, listening to the soft bubbling of the tub, the whisper of the wind in the trees, and the gurgle of the bamboo pipe spilling a constant stream of cool, fresh water into this rocky outcropping.

"Well, you know how I got here," Harold prompted.

"Yes," Elise agreed. "I do."

"And, I know how you got here," Harold continued.

"Yes," she said. "You do."

"Is there anything else in particular that you wanted to talk about?" he asked.

Elise shifted a bit, took a deep breath, and said "Harry..."

"Harold," he corrected.

"Harold," she agreed. "Sorry. You're not a little boy any more."

"Nope," he agreed. "I'm 30 years old."

"And I'm 50," she finished. "I suppose I could have been a better big sister."

"Nah, you were fine," he said, pushing some bubbles around with his fingers. "Actually, you were great. Mom and Dad were so mad at you that they left me pretty much alone."

"They never did understand," Elise said sadly. "I wanted them to, but they ... they ... just couldn't."

"Yea, well, they'd really freak out if they could see us now," Harold joked. "Being a lesbian is one thing, a polygamous mythical creature is really out there."

"Polygamy, huh?" Elise observed. "I guess that's technically true. It doesn't look that way when you're around them, does it?"

"No," Harold agreed. "It just seems natural to them."

"Yea," she said. "That's my favorite part."

"What is?" he asked.

"They are just what they are," she said. "No one apologizes for being a mermaid."

"Yea, I guess you're right," he said. "But that's not what is bugging you, is it?"

"No," Elise said. "You turned out to be a pretty smart guy despite our parents."

"You're the smart one who went to medical school," he countered. "I just ran away and became a merchant marine."

"That was probably the smartest thing you could have done," Elise said. "I feel guilty for abandoning you; I'm sorry."

"Don't be," he said, shifting uncomfortably. "You did the smart thing too."

"You're too nice to be my brother," she teased. "Brothers are supposed to tease sisters."

"If you had been there when I was a kid, I might not have been so nice," he said. Then he saw the look in her face. "Oh, god, no! Elise, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. No, I was a mean little kid."

"But you're not a kid any more," she said, smiling through her guilt.

"No, and I'm not mean either," he said. "I've changed."

"I can see that," she said. "I'm impressed."

"Hey, just cause Mom and Dad thought you were the evil spawn of the devil doesn't mean I think the same," he said, reaching out to her.

"Why were they so mean and small?" Elise said, her voice catching as his arm circled her shoulders.

"Don't know," he said. "Don't really care."

The sat together, their backs facing the mountain behind them, the dark sea reflecting the emerging stars and the moon. They didn't move for several minutes.

"Do you want to be like the Henderson's?" she asked. "I'd do that if you wanted to."

"What, become like your sister and then we go find a new mate?" he asked. "No, you and the good Doctor will make a great healing pod. I wouldn't want to kick Debra or Bridget out of their turn. Besides, I'm not certain that I'd be willing to be a mermaid, and I am sure as heck I wasn't going to be your pod-mate."

"Yea, that would be weird," she agreed, relieved. "I just wanted you to know that you're still my brother, even though we're not going to ... well, you know."

"You're still my sister, regardless of what happens," he said. "I'm not in any hurry, and I've got a big debt to pay off. The mers will let me know when they need me to change, and that's good enough for me."

"You really have grown up to be a special man," Elise said, giving her brother a peck on the cheek. "The mermaids who get you will be very lucky indeed."

Half the world away, Mac Bennett, a former Admiral now recently retired, pushed his rare filet mignon away from the center of his plate and looked longingly at the shark steak on Brent Dawson's plate.

"Why didn't you order the shark?" asked Joy Simpson, former CIA operative and old friend of Mac's. "Or the salmon?"

"I just wanted to savor a steak one last time," Mac grumped. "Now, it just doesn't seem appealing. I don't know why."

"I'd say it has something to do with the changes you're undergoing," Annette Dawson, retired CIA and former colleague with Joy, answered. "It looks to me like it's speeding up."

"Not in public," Joy admonished gesturing around the crowded restaurant.

"Joy, you're kidding?" Annette asked. "This is the Old Ebbitt! There are more international drop offs, more Congressional assignations, and more secrets discussed in this place than in Headquarters at Langley. Every world power has swept this place a dozen times, the owners know where their bread is buttered, and we're a block from the White House. No one cares about what two old people who are eating dinner with their children have to say to one another."

"We are not your children," Mac said, smiling. "Thank god."

"You look it," Brent said. "You both look half your age."

"Which is why we can't fly to Mermaid Island," Joy said glumly. "We don't match our passports anymore, and I don't want to call in any favors on this one because we can't afford a tail."

"We will have one soon enough," Mac joked.

"Not funny," Joy said. "We can't do anything that will put the mers in danger, and we don't yet have leverage over any of your people or any of my people that might force them to leave them alone."

"What about those anemones," Annette asked. "The ones you gave China, the European Union, and the US? Shouldn't they do the trick?"

"Governments don't make adjustments or promises quickly," Joy said. "We need more time, and I feel like we're running out of it."

"I know," Mac agreed. "I'm starting to feel ... um ... itchy."

"I feel that too," Joy agreed, brushing her now long, young looking brown hair back over her ear.

"If it is any consolation," Annette said, "you both look fabulous. Joy, how did you ever let Mac get away when you were young?"

"We were both focused on our careers," Joy answered. "But now we will have time to make up for lost time," she finished, taking Mac's hand in her own.

"Hopefully," Mac said. "First, we have to get back to the island without attracting too much attention."

"Anyone have any good ideas?" Joy asked.

"All we have are bad ones," Brent complained.

Annette ticked off a list with her fingers. "Can't fly, your passports won't pass inspection. Can't take a cruise because no commercial cruise lines make that trip. Can't switch cruises mid-way because your passports are worthless. We can't afford to buy a plane that can make the trip on one tank, too easy to track both the purchase and the plane itself. On the other hand, a small airplane, even though it's still expensive, is easy to trace because we would have to refuel in a foreign country, which means passports."

"We know," Joy agreed. "Our passports are now useless. You two could go, and we can sail. It's the only way to get there without having to go through security or the cost of buying a larger boat."

"I don't think it's safe for you two to be out on the ocean, alone, with those unstable microorganisms doing who-knows-what to your insides," Annette argued. "Sailboats wouldn't ever have to make landfall, if you plan carefully, but it would take three or four months to sail from here to Mermaid Island, and that's if you have perfect wind and weather for the entire trip. But ... you'd have to know what those microorganisms are doing to you and when they are going to do it."

"Pat said that you probably only had about a month before there were enough siren cells in your bodies to start the change," Brent said. "We can't afford a big boat, but we can afford one that will fit all four of us, and if we're going to do this, we ought to do it together and get started right now."

"How much untraceable cash do we have on hand?" Annette asked.

"About four hundred thousand dollars," Brent answered. "That will buy a good sailboat, but we wouldn't have much money left for three months of supplies."

"Well, we could get a smaller sailboat big enough for two, and we," Mac said indicating himself and Joy, "could swim."

Joy started to say something, but then she suddenly pitched forward, clutching her stomach.

"Joy!" Annette exclaimed. "Are you alright?"

Joy lifted her head towards her friend, her large brown eyes crinkled with pain. She opened her mouth to speak, and collapsed into her plate.

"You need to contact the island," Mac whispered, his own eyes flashing with pain he struggled to control. "Get help from Pat and ... " and then Mac himself lost consciousness and slumped onto the table.

"Check please," Brent signaled the waiter.

"Should I call an ambulance?" the surprised young man asked.

"No," Annette indicated with a roll of her eyes. "They are just young and don't handle their alcohol very well."

"We could use some help out to catch a cab," Brent said as he slipped a twenty-dollar bill into the waiter's hand.

"Absolutely, sir," the waiter nodded towards the kitchen, and two bus boys headed for the table, each with discrete, though smug smiles visible on their faces.

"There now," the elderly Dr. Riddles said, tying a scrap of cloth over the gash Hank had suffered on his arm. "That should protect that cut for a few days."

"We could just put mermaid milk on it and it would heal in seconds," Janice said.

"Not now," Hank said. "We are having a productive day, getting a lot done. Besides, Pat and the others are busy today. They've had a big break through."

"Really?" Dr. Riddles asked. "About what?"

"They are trying to develop a weapon strong enough to keep the rest of the world from trying to wipe us out," Janice answered.

"Oh, my," Dr. Riddles answered. "Hardly my cup of tea."

"What I wouldn't DO for a good cup of tea," Debra Hutchins complained.

"Yes, my dear," Dr. Riddles said sympathetically. "Only those who have actually been to England understand what it is to have a good cup of tea."

"Well, we will get back to work," Hank said, rising. "No sense in letting these last few days as humans go to waste. We can get Harold caught up on all kinds of maintenance."

"What is to become of that boy?" Debra asked, brushing her light brown hair away from her face.

"I'm sure that fate or circumstance will guide us there, in the meantime many of us have decisions to make, eh?" Dr. Riddles noted with a nod towards Hank.

"Yes, well, yes," Hank said as he and Janice turned and walked back down the path towards the beach.

"They are very nice," Debra observed.

"They are," he agreed. "Well, before he and his wife arrived, I could tell that you wanted to talk with me. Why don't we try again?"

Debra took a deep breath and looked at kindly old man before her. There was so much she wanted to say, so much she wanted, period. Several minutes passed, and she found that she could not say nothing.

"Mr. Connor, your old boss, has told me all about your condition," Dr. Riddles said, breaking the silence. "If that is what is worrying you."

"He what?" She sputtered, surprised.

"Debra, my dear," he continued, taking her hand. "I'm an old man, and I've seen a lot in my life. Even if Mr. Connor's hadn't told me a thing, I think I would know a transgendered person when I see one, even when they are as beautiful as you are."

"But ... but ... " Debra sputtered, feeling a burning sensation rise along her throat, her blush taking over.

"You really are quite beautiful, you know," he continued as though nothing was of any particular importance. "I am quite sure that most people whom you meet have always thought you to have been a woman. Though I'm sure that you simply cannot wait until you can have all the biological features and functions of your true gender. You may rest assured that I'll do anything I can to help."

"You ... you ... you ..." Debra said, now on the brink of tears.

"Yes, my dear?" he asked patiently.

"You wonderful, wonderful, man!" she exclaimed, throwing her arms around him and kissing him on his cheek.

"Now, now," he said with some humor. "There will be plenty of time for all of that once I've gotten a little bit younger. Let's not push me over the brink before I've had my first mermaid cocktail."

"Sorry," she said automatically, pulling back.

"No, my dear," he said, taking her hand and drawing her close. "It's quite alright. I'm just surprised you were worried. I thought you knew I knew."

"I'm glad you do," she admitted. "I cannot wait to become a mermaid."

"You do know the transition will not be easy?" he asked.

"What do you mean?" she asked.

"Well, I've been conferring with several of the mermaids, and they had one other transgendered person make the transition. The first feedings of mermaid milk actually heal your body to its original genetic expression. For a short period of time, you'll be a man again . Once you're healed, you can, well ... submit to me," he shuddered as he said it. "Oh, my; how distasteful. In any event, once we work that out, you'll be turned."

"Turned?" she asked.

"Well, that's what they call it," he said, stroking her hair to calm her. "According to them, you just have to be dominated by a male and you'll be turned inexorably towards becoming female again. Now, I am not of a mind to dominate anyone, so you'll just have to be a bit more meek and mild with me than you might normally, and I think we'll be fine."

"And you're alright with all of this?" she asked, still a bit surprised.

"Yes, my dear," he said. "Quite alright. Your body's chromosomes simply do match the gender you truly are. Why should that bother me?"

"Quite so!" she agreed. "But it bothers a lot of people. I do so wish there were more people like you in this world."

"Thank you, my dear," he said. "One can't worry about what other people think; it will drive one quite mad. Ignore them, and you will be the better for the effort."

"I certainly hope so," she said brightly. "And I don't give a peck how much it might hurt. I'm ready to be a mermaid."

"Well, then, why don't you run along and see what Harold needs help with, and I'll keep tidying up this hut?" he suggested.

"You really are a wonderful man," she gushed.

"Thank you, my dear," he said, smiling. "And you are a wonderful woman no matter what anyone else says. Now run along and get to work."

"Does everyone understand why we are doing this?" Pat asked the assembled mers, all present except for the three pods who were on the rescue mission to Davao. She looked around the Lab Cave, watching as everyone nodded.

"O.K., then," she sighed, and reached into the isolation chamber with her tongs, gently lifting out a small liquid-filled, green bottle. Everyone in the lab cave held their breath as Pat gingerly moved it across the table to where Phoebe and Alexis waited, and lowered the small, glass vial into the thick metal container. She tried holding her hand as steady as possible, worried that it was a mistake to invite the non-scientist mers to the cave, that the new viral-bacteria they had created were too unstable. But she had to agree with Alexis that everyone deserved to understand what they hoped to accomplish.

"Now?" her sister-wife Phoebe asked, nervously holding the top to the metal container.

"Now," Pat breathed, withdrawing the tongs from the opening, allowing Phoebe to position the lid over the thickly lined one-gallon container, held steady by Alexis, which was roughly the size of a milk container, but the structure was over two inches thick, and the threads along the underside of the lid were so fine that they were nearly impossible to see at arm's length.

Everyone watched in silence as Phoebe carefully started twisting the thick, heavy lid, aligning the threads with the open pot below. Several minutes passed in silence while Phoebe and Alexis worked the steel-gray lid onto the small container.

"John, are you sure that contraption will work?" Petra asked.

"Yes," John reassured her. "The deadly little bugs the girls have created are inert unless mixed with water. "This," he said thumping the complex metal contraption he had created, lying next to the pool in the lab, "will be set on the sea floor far from any volcanic activity and camouflaged. It's a dead man's drop. If the mechanism is not checked and re-set about once a year, the container will be twisted opened and the contents released into the ocean."

"What's the reset?" Petra asked.

"A pod needs to visit and have sex within a few feet of the mechanism," John said with a grin at his own pod. "The siren cells we release in our milk and sexual fluids will cause our friendly microorganisms living in this little area here," he pointed to a layer of thin webbing that ran along two bars of the contraption, "to stay alive. Their normal life cycles will keep this mesh stiff and strong. If they die, the mesh will dissolve in about a year, and the mechanical spring will do the rest."

"So, we have sex once a year, and nothing happens," Pat said. "But if no mermaid releases milk within a few yards of this machine at least once a year ... "

"The apocalypse will be unleashed," Galina said with a grim smile.

"Not the apocalypse," Pat admonished. "But the world's seawater will be dissociated into oxygen and hydrogen and various minerals."

"Which is bad, right?" Petra said.

"Really, really bad," John agreed.

"What, exactly, would happen?" Petra prodded.

"First, the atmosphere would be come supersaturated with all the newly released oxygen and hydrogen," Pat explained.

"And oxygen is highly corrosive and flammable," Phoebe added.

"And hydrogen is just plain flammable," Galina said.

"But we breathe oxygen," Petra protested. "How can it hurt us?"

"The amount of oxygen trapped in seawater, if released, would raise the level of oxygen in the atmosphere by over 33%," Pat explained.

"If that happened, all organic matter, including wet organic matter, like human bodies, would combust at 22 degrees Celsius," Phoebe said, shuddering.

"That's room temperature," Pat explained.

"But, we would be killed!" Petra exclaimed. "Galina, my darling, how could you work on such a thing."

"Everything would be killed, because we had already been killed," Galina explained.

"Yes, we would be dead already," John reassured Petra and the others. "That's the only way this thing would ever activate-if all the mers were killed."

"But what if something natural kills us off, and we can't check the device?" Bill asked, looking over his pod. "It's possible, you know."

"Unlikely, given everything we've learned about the siren cell," Pat countered. "We are actually pretty hard to kill. The siren cell not only allows us to heal ourselves from everything but the most traumatic injuries or attacks but it also makes our immune system nearly indestructible."

"We've been mers for nearly a year and a half," Phoebe added. "When was the last time any one of us even got the case of the sniffles?"

Petra furrowed her brow. "We don't get sick. Ever?"

"Right," Pat agreed. "There are enough of us now that wiping out all the mers would have to be a deliberate act. The consequences of that deliberate act have to be untenable because we cannot otherwise stop anyone from trying to kill us; so we have to force the major powers to insure that everyone, including themselves, will leave us alone."

"MAD," John said. "Mutually assured destruction."

"But we all hope that the world will never allow the canister to be opened," Galina said grimly. "Petra, my love, I would never create a thing I thought was not something that was either necessary or ultimately good for both us and the world."

"I will trust you," Petra said. "But I suppose that now I know why you've been so preoccupied. You haven't talked about your work with us in a while."

"Wow," Gabriel said. "That sounds so ... middle class, like Galina commutes to work, or something. But Petra's right, the four of you have been pretty shut up for the past few days, and I suppose this explains that. Try not to let that happen too often. For everyone's sake."

"We understand," Galina said, looking at her fellow scientists for agreement. They all nodded, feeling a bit chastised. "But that is why you are all here now."

"This is all well and good, but how will MAD help my father and Joy?" Sally asked.

"Well, it's hard to say," Pat said.

"Please try," Sally urged. "We might kill off all life on the planet, which is bad enough, but what is wrong with my father?"

"As you know, my love, your father and Joy were both exposed to the microorganisms in the Moon Pool," Alexis explained while hovering over Phoebe, helping her to screw the top into the container. "They have already regressed in age, and their bodies are starting to change. I thought I had told you this already," Alexis finished, looking up at her pod mate. "I love you."

"Oh, Alexis, I know you love me, but you often have your head buried in your work," Sally said. "I wasn't aware that we should be worried about what is happening. I don't think you've ever really explained to me the scope of the problem," she said, looking to Liga and Eric for confirmation.

"We know that they were infected," Eric added, putting a protective arm around Liga and Sally. "But we didn't know that it was progressing towards a change so quickly."

"What kind of change will they have?" Sally continued.

"We're not sure," Pat interrupted. "Phoebe, Alexis take your time; that seal has to be perfect."

"Yes, Mom," Phoebe teased. The two of them never the less slowed their efforts as they neared the end of the task.

"We have been in constant contact with your father via short wave, and they are fine," Pat reassured her. "They aren't changing into monsters or anything. They are just getting younger sooner than we expected."

"What did we expect?" Sally asked.

"Given the shared morphology of most oceanic microorganisms, we assumed that they would follow a similar chronology in their life cycles," Pat explained. "For example, Paracoccus pantotrophus is one of the bacterium forming one species of the hundreds of thousands of different microorganisms that living in the Moon Pool. It can live as chemoorgano-heterotroph, which means it eats, or metabolizes, a large variety of organic compounds. It can also live as a chemolithoautotrophic organism, which means it eats, or metabolizes, compounds like hydrogen, sulfide or thiosulfate that are oxidized to sulfate. The sulfur compounds serve as electron donors. Organo-heterotrophy can occur under aerobic or under anaerobic conditions; litho-autotrophy takes place aerobically."

"I am quite sure I didn't understand any of that, despite Galina's merbonds to me," Petra said. "Can you continue in English?"

"There are a lot of different kinds of micro-bugs living in the Moon Pool, actually all over the place," Phoebe explained, wishing Emma was back, because she seemed so good at translating this. "Normally they breed through cell division, which results in two clones of the original. Changes in morphology, which means their structure and function, normally happen very slowly. So, even though they breed often, like about every ten minutes or so, depending on the species, they don't change their morphologies very fast."

"Mac and Joy?" Sally prompted. "Can we just get to the point?"

"Even when you were human, you had lots of microorganisms in your body," Phoebe said. "There are actually more bacterial cells in a human body than there are human cells."

"What?" Petra asked, slightly disgusted by the thought. "Mers too?"

"Mers too," Phoebe confirmed. "The problem is that the lingering effects of radioactivity on this island has made the microorganisms more genetically unstable. They are constantly morphing. Microorganisms that eat other microorganisms eat most of those mutations, and our own genetic morphology is amazingly stable. So, the siren cells we produce seem to keep a steady supply of our symbiotic microorganisms going. We don't know how stable they will be in the absence of significant amounts of siren cells."

"Oh," Sally said, processing.

"Now that we have this device ready," Pat continued to explain to Sally, "Mac and Joy can worry more about what is happening to them rather than what might or might not happen to us. We now have MAD, and they can use that threat to help them escape to this island before the unstable microorganisms overtake them."

"Why do they need to get back here?" Liga asked, looking up from her chest where her daughter, Mari, was feeding.

"Unlike all of us, they never drank any of our milk," Sally explained, showing her understanding. "They don't have any "mermaid" siren cells in their systems. We're not sure what the microorganisms will do in the absence of siren cells delivered through mermaid milk."

"Exactly," Alexis said, smiling proudly at her pod-mate. "Anyone who is exposed to the microorganisms is infected with a viral packet that about fifty of the thousands of species in the Moon Pool carry. And even though the morphology of those viral packets are a near perfect match to siren cell DNA, we don't know if siren cells are actually produced by an infection. The epigenetic effects are too unpredictable."

"Epigenetic?" asked Petra.

"Non-cellular forces affecting gene expression," Pat explained.

"Um, in English?" Petra asked.

"Temperature, stress, hormones, or even the pH balance of the surrounding environment can cause some parts of DNA to control cell division rather than others," Phoebe said. "We think the microorganisms exerted an epigenetic effect on us, meaning they helped us become mermaids. If the change were to happen somewhere else, not in the Moon Pool, we don't know what the effects will be."

"What about Galina and Alexis?" Petra said. "They were changed outside the Moon Pool, and they turned out perfectly."

"But they were also infused with our siren cells and were surrounded by all of us and our mer-organs," Phoebe explained. "We were the epigenetic influence for their change. Joy and Mac are too far away for us to get to them and visa versa."

"So, what's gonna happen to my father?" Sally asked.

"We don't know, but we advised them to seek saltwater as soon as possible," Pat answered. "We hope the levels of the microorganisms in their bodies have created proto-mer organs, and if they are really lucky, our siren cells. If true, it would seem like good news, but it is bad because it might start a spontaneous change. If that happens, they are going to need to be in seawater so the microorganisms can absorb and process the minerals and compounds in the surrounding seawater that they use to help us change."

"That's the big insight from Kate and Ann's transformation," Phoebe said with enthusiasm, giving the lid a final twist. "The microorganisms use minerals from the sea to speed our changes, and multiply as they transform us."

"We are their breeding ground?" Petra asked.

"Not just us," Phoebe continued. "These symbiotic bugs breed anytime they interact with organic material, but they affect that material differently depending on its origins. Remember the fish, and hair, and all that?"

"Yes, I remember those experiments," Petra said, smiling at her former niece, both of them blushing at the memory of their own participation in those various experiments.

"Well, we believe that when they encounter human material, which matches exactly with the virus DNA they carry, it kicks in a full change," Pat finished.

"In a few weeks," Phoebe started again to distract herself from her memories of the experiment with Petra, "Mac and Joy might be in great danger of having the micro-organisms start to harvest their own bodies in the search for the raw materials they need to create new tissues, bones, organs, etc."

"I thought the siren cells do that," Petra said.

"They do, if there are enough of them, and if they were ingested directly from another mer," Pat explained. "When we underwent our transformations, we had high concentrations of siren cells in our bodies, and were able to use our proto-mer-organs to focus bioelectrical energy on our changes, which were both bio-chemical and electromagnetically guided, and we had access to the biomass of all microorganisms in the Moon Pool, which is substantial. Some of that biomass became our new biomass."

"So, they might not have mer-organs to guide their change," Petra said, understanding. "You said that Phoebe's first change was a one in a trillion-trillion shot-in-the-dark."

"Exactly," Pat agreed. "Mac and Joy never drank any mermaid milk, and we don't know what will happen."

"And they might not have access to enough biomass to make the transformation into mers," Sally said, also understanding.

"But even if they do have access to biomass and our siren cells fully developed in their bodies," Phoebe said as she handed the now sealed container to John. "No one has ever changed solely from the influences of the Moon Pool, so that adds to why we don't know what will happen."

"We should have given them our milk," Sally said.

"Hindsight is always 20/20," Pat said.

"What's their prognosis?" Danni asked, her mothering instincts coming to the fore.

"We really don't know," Pat said with some fear. "We hope that both of them had enough body mass of their own so the micro-organisms could create proto mer-organs."

"Which we think happened when they passed out in a restaurant," Phoebe said, watching as John carefully positioned the container within the dead man's drop he had built.

"We don't know for sure what happened," Pat argued. "And they haven't reported a repeat in the last several days. But, I don't think that they have enough siren cells in their bodies to make the changes yet, and they certainly don't have enough to undergo the change painlessly. We hope that seawater will be enough for them to make the full transition without our help."

"Why don't they just fly here?" Petra asked.

"They probably don't match their passports any longer, and they were both too important in the government to pass security without being noticed," Sally said.

"So, what are we going to do?" Eric asked.

"Wait," Pat said. "No one here can travel that distance to help them soon enough. It would take almost two months of near constant swimming to reach the east coast of the US, and Sally is right; they can longer use their own passports. They will have to find a way to get through this on their own."

Emma watched MuSu's yellow-fringed flukes rise and fall inches from her own out stretched hands. The warm, dark water rushed past her, caressing her body as she swam in his wake. Her sister-wives were slightly ahead of her, each one trailing the ends of MuSu's wide pelvic fins. She could feel the extra drag of her utility belt, but knew the added weight of the shark meat would be worth the extra time it took to reach Davao. She nevertheless wondered how MuSu could pull the large net suspended from his own utility belt. His net contained the same weight of dried and salted shark meat as she herself weighed, but he seemed tireless.

She wished she could "see" the connections binding her to her podmates like Eric could, but she felt satisfied she could feel them. She wondered what allowed him to do that. All of the testing they had tried did not provide them with the slightest clue. She was struck by the sudden thought that she missed her fellow scientists.

[Oh, hey!] she sent out via her CHEW.

[Yes?] MuSu's quiet calm was discernable even through his CHEW.

[We need to find a spot so that we can report,] Emma said. [It's time.]

[How can you tell?] Rikki asked.

[She just can,] Cleo said. [It drives me crazy.]

[We heard you,] Trixi sent forward, as MuSu's pod was far ahead of Wong's and Mark's. [Just let us know when you're ready.]

[Emma?] MuSu asked with his usual implacability.

[Maybe another two degrees west,] she suggested. [We're nearly there.]

[I wish they would stop that,] Cleo complained. [It's like Emma's brain is hooked up to a GPS system.]

[You're just jealous,] Rikki teased. [It's not a GPS; she's got a photographic memory.]

[Same thing,] Cleo grumped. [And this bag is so heavy.]

[You can give it to me when we stop,] MuSu said.

[No you can't,] Rikki interjected. [He's got more than his fair share as it is.]

[Can you see it?] Emma asked, ignoring her sister-wives' argument.

[Yes,] MuSu reported.

A small seamount loomed up out of the darkness below, the coral growing along the sides of the rocks glowing dimly in the moonlight. The top of the seamount was only about five meters below the surface, but it looked as though it had been years since any volcanic activity had occurred. As they drew closer they saw an area capable of sheltering them from the strong currents welling up from below, and they headed for the rocky outcropping.

Together, MuSu's pod approached the ledge and drew up still in perfect formation. Silently the three mermaids reached for MuSu's utility belt, carefully unhooking the large net he was pulling. They let the net settle onto the flat rock below, and MuSu stretched his back forwards and backwards.

[Are you alright?] Emma asked.

[Fine,] he said, smiling reassuringly.

Emma looked over her mate as he smiled back at her. She could see the strain in his CHEW, but outwardly, MuSu was not letting anyone see what it had cost him to pull that extra weight for so long. Emma felt a twinge in her own back and reached around to rub the small of her back.

[No,] MuSu said, flicking his tail and coming to her side. He held Emma's pelvic fin in one hand, while slowly massaging the juncture where her torso and tail met. She closed her eyes in appreciation.

[I'm next,] Cleo said.

[You didn't carry as much as Emma did,] Rikki said. [You don't deserve a turn.]

[Cleo is next,] Emma said, groaning as MuSu pressed firmly into her sore muscles.

[I carried more than she did,] Rikki protested.

[But Cleo can't help but be who she is,] MuSu said with a smile at Rikki. [And we love her just the same.]

[YOU might,] Rikki said petulantly.

[Emma's right,] Cleo said contritely. [Rikki, you should be next.]

[Who's going to do MuSu?] Emma asked.

[All of you,] he said with the slightest twitch of his lips.

[Oh, yes,] all three mermaids giggled despite their fatigue, feeling their bodies responding to MuSu's undertones.

[Trixi?] Pat raised her hands to her tiara, trying to focus all her CHEW towards the far away mermaid.

All the mers floated in a fan formation above the rocky seafloor along the west side of Mermaid Island. Pat floated at the point of the fan, facing west, while behind her were John, Danni, and Phoebe. Their three daughters paid little attention to their parents' efforts as they played and swam among their nearly motionless tails as they floated vertically in the dark water. Directly behind John's pod were Gabriel's pod and Eric's pod, and behind them Trevor's pod, Tuo's pod, and Bill's pod were fanned out in formation. All of them were attempting to boost Pat's signal, but no one had any idea how they were supposed to be helping.

Pat had first tried by herself, but then called out for help after many minutes had passed without a successful connection. Trixi's signals had been growing weaker over the past several days as the three pods moved further and further away, but this was the first time that Pat felt worried that their CHEW might not span long enough distances.

[Trixi?] Pat sent out into the inky darkness, feeling the presence of her fellow mers as they floated behind her.

[Yes, mom,] the faint reply finally coming back.

[Yes, now I've got it,] Eric reported. [Just barely, though.]

[Can you hear me?] Pat asked.

[You're coming through much louder than two night's ago,] Trixi reported. [What are you doing that's different?]

[You're still pretty weak,] Pat said. [I've got everyone here with me trying to help me boost my CHEW.]

[Wow,] Trixi said. [How are you doing it?]

[We are in a big triangle, with me at the apex, all pointing in your general direction,] Pat said.

[O.K.,] Trixi said. [Give me a minute.]

A few moments passed.

[This better?] Trixi sent out with much greater strength.

[Yes,] Pat said with relief. [It really works! You're coming in much stronger.]

[We are doing the same thing, but how does it work?] Trixi asked.

[We can figure that out later,] Pat said. [Status?]

[We're on schedule,] Trixi reported. [One bit of good news; we killed a shark yesterday with just our CHEW. The boys were basically mentally shouting war cries at the shark as it approached. Emma thinks that because a Great White's ampullae are more sensitive than most other species, it worked with that animal. We're not certain it would work on other creatures or even other sharks.]

[She's probably right, but that is still great news,] Pat agreed. [We'll look into that phenomenon here. The Johanna is still on schedule.]

[All systems go, then?] Trixi asked.

[We are still at a go,] Pat answered. [Next chat is in two days?]

[Yes, unless we need something sooner,] Trixi said.

[Be safe,] Pat said.

[Yes, mom,] Trixi said. [Nite.]

Pat relaxed, feeling their connection fade into the regular "noise" of the sea. She blinked her eyes, her temples were throbbing and she could feel tightness along her lower back. [Eric, what did you see?] She asked, ignoring her own discomfort.

[Well, normally, like now, there are multiple lines of connection flickering among all of us, like those toys we used to play with where you put your finger on the glass globe and all the flickering goes to that one point,] Eric said, swimming towards the front to face Pat. [That's what happened when we concentrated on you, all those lines focused on your ... well ... your um ....]

[You mean my ass?] Pat laughed. [Well, it's not an ass any more. That got moved around to the front.]

[Well, um, yes,] Eric stammered. [It still sort of looks like a ... well ... um, an ass, and yours is a very nice one. Anyway, our lines snaked into you, but Trixi's CHEW hit your tiara and traveled down your dorsal fringes to where our lines went into your ... um ... ass.]

[That makes sense; I think I've got a backache,] Pat said. [And a headache. Whatever is happening when we do that, it's hard work for the person at the focal point.]

"Then use your voice," John said into the water, his resonate mer-voicebox cycling the air in his chest past his now rarely used vocal chords. "We can still talk."

"Yes, we can," Pat agreed.

[But let's get you back to the Moon Pool,] Danni sent via her CHEW, her mothering instincts taking over. [You can grill Eric about what he saw after you've had some rest.]

[Yes,] Phoebe agreed, looking carefully at her pod-mate. [Besides, I can do the post with Eric, I usually take the notes anyway. You go rest. We can see the strain in your eyes.]

[All right, all right,] Pat said via her CHEW. "Ohhh," she moaned out loud.

"That's it!" John shouted. "Everyone stop using CHEW with Pat, (he paused to generate more air) what do singers call that thing they do when they are sick?"

"Vocal rest," Phoebe said.

"Fine," John said. "Pat is on CHEW rest until further notice."

"Hey, does anyone else hear that?" Eric asked, his voice tinged with worry.

"Hear what?" Sally asked.

Everyone grew still, the dark sea filled with a great white noise passing for silence. Then, they could all hear it, one sound rising about the general hum. A boat, a large boat throbbed its way through the water, and it was getting closer.

"The second son has finally arrived," Gabriel said with grim determination.

"How do you know it's him?" Bill asked.

"Those are the same engines as Manalo's first boat, the one that Michael Thompson sold back to Abao," Gabriel said.

"You can recognize the engine noise?" Bill asked.

"I never forget the sound of an enemy," Gabriel said with a fierce smile.

Abao looked over the deck of his brother's boat, pleased with the remodeling he had accomplished. The 50-caliber machine gun was his favorite touch. His crew was arranged behind armored positions along the sleek yacht, making it look both intimidating and ridiculous. In the bright early morning sunshine, he could see small huts arranged along the tree line between the jungle and the beach, and swung the bow towards them. He hoped to catch everyone still asleep, and it looked as though he was successful.

"Now!" he shouted, and his men opened fire on the beach. Most of them had small arms, but the big gun started chewing up the sand, trees, and the huts, sending shards of beach hut, palm trees, and debris flying in all directions. He expected to see Alberto's men burst forth from the huts, but nothing moved, other than the havoc wrought by the 50-caliber.

"Stop!" he ordered.

Abao throttled the big boat's engines back, letting her drift towards shore, scanning the beach for any signs of resistance or movement. Nothing moved. He waited for a full minute, but nothing even twitched. Where was everyone?

Suddenly, the boat lurched suddenly as the engine seized. Abao shouted at his men, ordering them to shoot into the water. They must have scuba gear, he thought, and were trying to attack the boat from below. Everyone stood up from behind their armored positions and began firing into the water, the bullets sending up a fine mist as they zipped into the water.

Several meters below the yacht, several mermen watched with curiosity as the bullets slowed within a meter of the surface and began sinking gently towards the bottom. With an unseen signal, they all took one last look at the small device attached to one of the boat's engine coolant intake valves and quickly swam away. If their adversaries above had stopped firing useless bullets into the water, the mers might have been spotted. But no one above could see anything in the lagoon through the hail of useless gunfire.

"Stop!" Abao shouted again, realizing they were just wasting bullets. He had to repeat the order several times before everyone stopped firing. In the eerie silence that followed, the odd sight of three dolphins leaping out of the water just beyond the entrance to the lagoon distracted Abao and his crew. They watched the acrobatic display for a few seconds, then all of them were thrown to the deck as an enormous hollow THUMP shook the boat. The hull lurched in the water, and Abao was thrown to the deck. As he scrambled to his feet, he saw water welling up from below.

There must be a hole in the boat the size of a car, Abao thought to himself. He knew he could not stay on the boat for very long, but if Alberto and his brother were in the water, he didn't want to go in empty handed. He braved the rising water, desperately searching for his Uzi. He felt the cold steel in his hands even as the water covered his head. He swam out of the hatch, pushing away from the deck, struggling to separate himself from the sinking boat's undertow, but before he could start swimming for the surface, he felt a sharp prick on his leg, and felt a deadness spreading up his legs and into the rest of his body. When it reached his other arm, the Uzi slipped from his grasp, and knew that now was his time to die.

He wondered briefly, if he was going to drown or be killed, then suddenly he was being pushed towards the surface. He watched as the surface grew closer and closer, and while he couldn't move a muscle, nevertheless he wondered how long he would be able to hold his breath. His face broke through into the air, and a second later, he pulled in a long breath of fresh air.

"How many?" Abao heard a voice ask. He tried turning his head towards the speaker but could not move.

"Five," the answer came from the opposite direction. "The two who were up front died in the blast."

Abao could do nothing but look up at the sky. His heart pounded in his chest, and he knew he was paralyzed, but didn't know how or why.

"Are the girls ready?" the second voice continued.

"Yes, we're going to do it right here, with Snort and his girls present," the first voice answered.

"Are the CHEW boosters ready?" asked the second voice.

"Yes," the first voice answered. "If they work, I hope we can find a way to get them to Mac and Joy."

Abao heard the distant commotion of voices shouting on the beach and one of the two speakers ducked under the water and swam away from him. Ha! He knew that there had been someone in the huts! Hopefully, he and his men had at least killed a few of Alberto's men. Girls? Had Alberto brought some of the girls that were to have gone into his father's brothels to this island? His father! Abao felt that familiar tightness in his gut, knowing he had failed his father yet again. His thoughts were broken by the return of one of the two voices.

"It's going to be alright," the voice said reassuringly. "Some shrapnel got Dr. Riddles, but everyone is alright. Bill and his girls are with him now."

"I guess Dr. Riddles and his girls are going to start their transition sooner than they expected," the second voice said with a chuckle. "Let's get moving."

Abao felt himself being pushed through the water, and as they pushed him gently along, one of them began to undress him. He wanted to shout and protest, but could do nothing. Quickly, he was divested of his clothes, and heard the sound of the waves along the sand more clearly. He must be getting closer to the shore.

"That's good," he heard a female voice say, and he stopped moving. He heard something small and light hit the water near his head, and wanted to flinch, but he could not move at all. His only sign of fear was a few quick blinks.

"Don't worry," he heard the first male voice say. "It doesn't really hurt much, and you're not going to die. If the girls whipped up a batch that does everything we think it can do, you'll be free in no time."

Although he spoke English perfectly, Abao had no idea what any of that meant. None of these voices sounded remotely familiar, and he wondered if these people had defeated both Alberto and his brother. He felt a small cushion being positioned under his head with a small strap that went across the front of his neck. As soon as it was secure, he felt the hands holding him leave. He had a momentary panic, fearing he would sink, but the cushion was apparently a float of some kind, and he merely drifted in the gentle swell of the lagoon. He felt another body bump into his head, and smelt garlic. It had to be one of his crew—all of them smelled of garlic.

"This will feel like a small prick," a female voice said, feeling a needle pierce his arm. As the stranger slowly pressed on the plunger, Abao could feel a warm liquid flow into his body. It tingled, almost like a burning sensation, but it was not painful. He could hear the same reassurance repeated in Spanish and then in Filipino. He wondered how the speaker knew he spoke English while his crew did not.

"Are the boosters and the sensors ready?" the same female voice asked.

"Yes, we're ready to go," another female voice answered.

"Give me a sec," the first female said, and Abao could hear her duck her head back under the water. He felt the vortex of a large fin kicking to move away from him, then there was silence. All he heard was the gentle sound of the waves washing up on the beach and the cry of sea birds overhead. There was also the sound of gentle lapping of the water on his own, or someone else's, body.

Suddenly, a dolphin's call broke the silence, and Abao realized that the creature must be very close to him. A second dolphin answered the call and then a third. In the background, he could hear something that sounded like women humming a low tone, but he couldn't be sure.

The tingling in his arm grew worse, and soon his entire upper body was buzzing with energy. He felt the paralysis wear off slowly, the tingling replacing it with a feeling of his flesh vibrating. His body started twitching, and he wondered if he would be able to swim away, somehow find his gun, and fight his way clear. He could hear the near constant chattering laughter of the dolphins, and he felt as if his mind was being tortured.

The vibrating flesh feeling now covered his entire body, and he could fell his limbs twitching and jerking randomly at his sides. The water around him was also boiling. Wait, no, not boiling, but thousands of tiny bubbles were rising all around him. He no longer felt paralyzed but neither could he seem to control his limbs. Just when he thought he might have control of his legs, a great pressure seemed to press in on them, and they just shriveled up. He felt his lower spine stretch out, and there was some pain with that, but it felt more like serious discomfort, rather than serious pain.

As he thrashed in the roiling water, he was thankful for the floatation cushion under his head, keeping his head in the air. He wondered what was happening to him, but fear clouded his mind. He couldn't concentrate. Suddenly, his head felt like a giant vice was squeezing his forehead and someone was pulling his jaw forward. Every bone in his body felt like putty being pushed and pulled in all directions. His brain was being filled with alien thoughts, and he couldn't figure out what they meant.

No longer could he feel any of his limbs clearly, but his arms felt as if they had shrunk and all his joints were frozen. He felt his head slip off the cushion, and he rolled over onto his stomach. He was holding his breath, but didn't dare breathe. His insides felt like mush, and knew that whatever was happening to him, it was not a simple change. He lost track of time as his entire body felt like taffy being pulled and pushed in many directions all at once. He was barely aware that he was breathing through his nose, but it felt strange, as if his nose was on top of his head. That was impossible!

The sound of the buzzing grew, feeling a strange new force pressing in on his mind. He fought it off, but it still pressed in, harder and harder with each passing second. "I am Abao," he thought fiercely to himself, and then his mind seized for just a second and foggy whiteness filled his senses. "I am not BaBa!" he fought back. It was the last human thought he had.

"Are you sure that you're alright?" Debra asked, her voice etched with concern.

"I'm sure that I'll be fine," Dr. Riddles answered. "The mermaid milk is working quite well, thank you." He smiled over at Mae who had just fed him some of her milk and sprayed it over his thigh and Debra's hand, stopping the blood flow. There was still some lingering pain from where the fragment of one of the rounds from the 50-caliber had torn through his leg, severing an artery. Debra's quick thinking, pressing her hand over his wound, probably saved his life. He briefly wondered if Mae's yellow and blue tail would affect the colors of how he turned out.

"Take your hand away, my dear," he said to Debra. "It really has healed already."

Fearfully Debra lifted her hand, expecting to see the ragged gash she had only moments ago covered with her hand. Beneath her hand was smooth, white skin, looking much younger than the skin surrounding the wound site. Miraculous.

"Well, it looks like we should get the four of you started," Pat said as she salamandered up to the small cluster of people gathered around the quickly healing Dr. Riddles. "Sis, is everyone ready?"

"More than ready, thanks to Debra's quick action," Bridget McDonnell, Pat's older sister answered.

"And you four are settled?" Pat asked, eyeing each one carefully.

"Absolutely," Debra answered, looking up from Dr. Riddles' healed leg.

"Yes, my dear," the doctor answered.

Bridget and Elise held hands and both nodded.

"Right then," Pat said. "We'll get you all started while we wait for Hank and crew to settle up their plans. Anyone have any preferences?"

"Well, Mae's already got me started," Dr. Riddles noted. "Does changing feeders seem to have any negative effects?"

"We think that the greater the diversity you have in feeders, the stronger the effects of the siren cells," Pat said.

"Well, since we have some extra healing to do thanks to Mr. Dimaunahan's second son," he said, "why don't we start with some mothers and some privacy."

"That's what I thought," Pat agreed and nodded to Mae who salamandered over to Bill.

"Did the experiment with the dolphins work?" Mae asked.

"Yes, it was a great success," Pat said, smiling. "There are five new female dolphins, all of whom are linked to us, possessing superior intelligence for dolphins, but significantly less so than humans or mermaids."

"Good," Bill said. "I wonder how many more sons Mr. Dimaunahan has."

"One more," Pat answered. "Can you send for my girls?" she asked. Bill and Mae nodded and headed back to the water. A few moments later, Phoebe, Petra, and Galina made their way up the beach.

"Danni's got our brood," Phoebe reported. "Xing's got theirs."

"Debra, why don't you start with me," Pat suggested. "You do know that this first one will actually hurt a bit?"

"You know?" Debra asked.

"Yes," Pat said gently. "You will technically "heal" back to being a man, and then you can begin your journey to biological femininity. Your soul has always been female, and now your body can finally catch up."

"How does everyone know all this?" Debra asked, drawing her knees into her chest.

"Not everyone knows," Pat reassured her. "But my sister and I do share some secrets."

"Don't worry Debra," Bridget said as she settled herself into Phoebe's lap. "Soon you will be my sister-wife, and then we can share our own secrets."

"Actually, we don't have very many secrets here," Petra said as she settled herself next to Elise. "You'll understand why once you're a mermaid, Debra."

Debra looked at Petra's incredible breasts, which were easily the largest breasts she had ever seen. She watched as Elise quickly positioned herself in Petra's lap and began to suckle. Petra's eyes closed with pleasure as she fed the older woman the life-giving and life-changing milk she possessed.

Debra turned to Pat's outstretched arms and once again was arrested by her overwhelming beauty. Soon, she reminded herself, she too would be as beautiful. She crossed over to Pat, sank to her knees, then turning over on her back. She could feel her small breasts shift on her chest. She had a momentary twinge of regret. Her hard won breasts, years of hormone therapy and surgery, and she was about to lose them. Well, only for a little bit, she reminded herself silently. She looked up at Pat's large breast hanging over her face, and parted her lips as Pat lowered a nipple into her open mouth.

She surrounded the large nipple with her lips and began suckling. As the warm, sweet milk seeped into her mouth, Debra could feel a heat rising in her body. After several minutes of nursing, Pat switched breasts and continued to feed. Debra felt her body growing more and more feverish, but continued drinking. She felt Pat's other breast run dry, and rolled away onto her side, clutching her groin and stomach, feeling a fire build between her legs. This was not a fire of passion, but a fire of healing. Of rebuilding tissue that had been removed, unwanted tissue, a return to her original genetic structure.

She felt a gentle hand come to rest on her shoulder, and knew it was Dr. Riddles. Her body twisted and turned as tissue was rebuilt and foreign objects were expelled. She moaned in pain.

"Be easy, my little one," he said as he gently held her shoulder.

Debra moaned again, her pain lessening, but her psychic pain was building. She could feel the parts of herself returning, and her female underwear and shorts were crushing her newly rebuilt penis.

"Hold me," she said, turning her body into his.

Dr. Riddles folded his arms around her, pulling her head into his lap. He continued to stroke her hair, waiting for her to stop moaning in pain. After a few minutes, Debra felt the pain subside, then opened her eyes and looked up at Dr. Riddles.

"Dr. Riddles?" she began.

"I believe you really ought to call me James, now," he said.

"James?" she repeated.

"Yes, dear?" he asked. "What can I do for you?"

"Kiss me?" she asked timidly.

"Of course, my dear," he answered, lifting her head gently towards his. She felt him brush his lips on hers, and after a moment of internal panic, something tickled the base of her brain. Something clicked. She opened her lips to his and felt "it;" her body turning, matching what her mind had known for years. Her shoulders relaxed, and the pain in her abdomen lessened. After another minute of kissing, James lifted his head from hers and smiled, his pale blue eyes already looking brighter and bluer.

"Again?" he asked.

"Yes, again," she said, tilting her face towards him. All the pain was worth this wonderful feeling of simply giving herself to this warm and gentle man.

"Yea, I know," Brian agreed. "It is sort of weird. But to be a part of all this," he said, his arm tracing a circle to include the entire island and sea near where they stood. "Now, THAT trumps any weirdness I feel."

Hank watched Brian's hand as it swept across the horizon, and then his gaze returned to the spot at the mouth of the lagoon where the now much larger pod of dolphins frolicked in the afternoon sun. He knew that Tuo's pod was still sweeping the sunken yacht for any bugs, tracers, or transmitters that might be used to trace their location back to Abao's father, but nothing of their efforts could be seen from the beach. Hank heard a bird cry from within the jungle and was reminded that James and his girls were already three feedings into their transition. They would be joining the mers in the Moon Pool the next morning for their final change. And, as seemed to be the tradition, James and his girls were spending their last night on land at the mountainside huts and hot tub.

"So, you would ... " Hank could not continue.

"Listen," Brian said, turning towards his brother-in-law, his military bearing stiffening his spine. "Your wife loves you more than she can ever or will ever love me, that much I'd stake my life on. Now, I don't pretend to understand what they have planned this or why they want to follow this path, but I do know that if Julie asked me to be her sisterwife, I'd be freaked out, but I think I would do it."

"Think?" Hank challenged.

"Well, I'd be lying if I pretended that the shoe was really on the other foot," Brian said. "They haven't asked me, and that makes me think that I'm lucky. You're right. I don't know, really, how you must feel. I guess I'm sorry, in a way, but at the same time, I'm glad. You know?"

"Nope," Hank said with a sigh. "I don't know. One thing has changed for me, actually. I finally understand why becoming a mer would be wonderful, but I'm still not sold on why or even how I should become a mermaid, especially, you know, your ... mermaid."

"Well, you'd really be Janice's mermaid," Brian said with a grin. "She has made that very clear to me, I can tell you."

"What if I want to be my own mermaid?" Hank asked more rhetorically than actually.

Brian shrugged, looking back out at the playful dolphins.

"So, what do you think having my wife as your pod-mate would be like?" Hank asked, suddenly enjoying the way Brian was visibly squirming.

"Um, well, I ... I don't really think about, well ... you know," Brian sputtered. "I mean, she is still your wife, you know."

"Yea, I know," Hank agreed. "But still, I've thought about being with Julie once or twice. Don't tell me you haven't done the same thing with Janice!"

"Well, yea," Brian agreed, a blush creeping across his cheeks. "Of course, I mean, I'm not ... "

"Dead?" Hank asked. "Yet?" he said again with just a small hint of menace.

"Hey, now," Brian pleaded. "You brought this whole damn thing up. Ease up on me."

"How are you ever going to become my pod-mate?" Hank wondered out loud.

"What?" Brian protested. "You don't think I can do it?"

"I'm not sure I can do it," Hank said.

A few more awkward moments passed between them.

"Do you know what Janice wants you to become?" Brian asked.

"A mermaid," Hank answered with exasperation. "Haven't you been listening to anything we've been talking about?"

"No, no," Brian explained. "What kind of mermaid, you know? What would you look like, your new name, stuff like that."

"Oh," Hank said. "No, actually."

"Haven't you talked about it with her?" Brain asked.

"Sort of," Hank said. "But we have never gotten to that level of detail yet."

"Have you thought about it?" Brian asked.

"No, and I don't want to," Hank answered.

"You've never wondered what it would be like to be a girl, not even for just a little bit?" Brian challenged.

"Of course I've wondered," Hank said, growing exasperated. "I've never taken further than the most superficial speculation. What, do you have a name for your possible girl-self?"

"No," Brian said. "I guess we're alike in that. I've wondered, but only briefly."

"Right, so I'm the lucky one," Hank said.

"Yea," Brian agreed.

They both watched the sea for a few minutes, each lost in thought.

"So, why do you want to become a mer?" Hank asked.

"Because Julie wants to," Brian answered.

"No," Hank said. "Not good enough. We all have to have our own reasons, I've learned at least that much. What do you want by becoming a merman? Seriously."

"Seriously?" Brain stalled.

Hank nodded, remaining silent. After a few more seconds, Brian spoke.

"When I look at how powerful the other mermen are, how they move through the water, wow," he said. "Then, when I see how their mermaids are so devoted to them, you know, I want that. I want that feeling of ... of ... taking charge, of taking responsibility, you know?"

Hank smiled to himself. Mermen in charge? Hardly. He wondered if Brian had ever spoken to any of the other mermen. He was certain Brian had never spoken to Kate and Ann, and he was pretty certain both Janice and Julie were keeping him largely in the dark about what "taking responsibility" as a merman actually meant.

"Yea, I know, taking charge," Hank agreed. "So, do you know what the girls have planned for us?" He asked, secretly enjoying the irony of the question, hoping that Brian wouldn't notice.

"No," Brian admitted sheepishly. "They won't tell me. Julie said that I would just screw it up."

"I don't think you'd screw it up," Hand said supportively. "But I do think that the girls are determined to get their way. I suppose it's useless to fight them any longer."

"That's it?" Brian asked. "You're just going to give in?"

"I learned a long time ago that I do much better when I let the woman I'm in love with be in charge," Hank said. "From the first kiss to the first child, it is always better for the man when the woman makes the decision."

"Ha! Now, that's girl talk," Brian said. "I can see why they want you to be the sister wife."

"All right, air-brain-boy," Hank said. "What is the best sex you've ever had?"

"What's this got to do with you?" he demanded.

"Humor me?" Hank asked. "I've been your brother-in-law for nearly twenty years."

"Best sex ever?" Brain asked. "Doesn't have to be Julie, and you won't hold it against me or tell her?"

"Scout's honor," Hank said, making the sign with his right hand.

"This amazing flight instructor I had in basic training," Brain said remembering.

"What, a real Top Gun experience?" Hank said. "You never told me about that."

"You never asked, and it was right before I met Julie," Brian said. "Anyway, she was fantastic."

"Date or one night stand?" Hank asked.

"Three nights," Brian said. "I would have done more, but she moved on. A second lieutenant wasn't good enough for her."

"Who asked whom to go to a motel?" Hank asked.

"It was her room," Brian said. "And she asked me," he said with pride.

"Exactly," Hank said.

"Exactly what?" Brian said.

"She was in charge," Hank said. "When a woman says 'no,' it means no. When a woman says 'yes,' it still means no. But when a woman says "Come back to my room and fuck my brains out," it means 'hell yes' to the best damn sex any one will ever know."

"Huh," Brian said. "I never thought of it like that."

"Obviously," Hank said, starting to walk back up to the beach huts.

"Where are you going?" Brian asked.

"To see if I can have the best damn sex of my life," Hank answered.

"oooooooohhhhhhhh," Debra groaned feeling her insides churn, the siren cells finally reorganizing her internal organs into a female configuration.

"Does it hurt?" James asked, his bright blue eyes shining in the setting sun.

"Not really," she lied, looking up into his now young face.

James' formerly white hair was now a lovely, rich brown. His skin was lightly tanned and taut, his jaw line looking particularly handsome, Debra thought. She loved the way he looked at her. She loved the way all three of her new pod-mates had been looking at her for the past twenty-four hours. The focus they showered upon her had transformed her into the girl she had known herself to be since she was a little boy. But, she still didn't know what the combined effects of the siren cell and her pod-mate's bioelectrical, proto-mer influences had wrought.

"Here, drink," Bridget said, moving through the hot tub so that she could move her youthful breasts over Debra's lips. "My milk has already started."

Debra opened her full and soft lips to receive Bridget's extended nipple, the end already oozing a few drops of white milk. She took it into her mouth and felt the warm milk fill her cheeks. It tasted wonderful, but sensed it wasn't nearly as strong as any of the other mermaids who had already fed her. She knew it wouldn't help with the pain as much as Bridget intended, but she loved her new pod-mate for the thought.

"It's amazing how quickly your milk has come in," Elise said, giving her perky breasts a squeeze. "I'm barely there."

"Pat says it runs in the family," Bridget said, savoring the sensuality that came with any feeding. "Does that help any?" she asked as Debra finished up.

"Yes," Debra said, it only being half a lie. "I feel much better."

"That's good, pumpkin," Bridget said. "Because it looks like your bread has been baked."

"I know," Debra said, grimacing a little bit. "I might look done on the outside, but the inside is still cooking. It feels like someone stuck a spoon through my belly button and is giving everything a good stir."

"Well, trust me, when you're done, it will have been worth it. I know you are the one who had to change the most," Bridget said. "But I have to say that I love my changes a lot!" She laughed, shaking her new long brown hair over her youthful and slender shoulders.

"Hang in there," James said. "Only a little while longer, and you'll be 100% girl."

"She certainly looks it now," Elise said, pushing her very long blond hair back over her ear. "And I'm a medical doctor too, James."

"You don't look like a doctor any more," Bridget teased. "You look like a Playboy Bunny."

"No ears," Elise said, shaking her head of beautiful new hair at her lover.

"You do look like a Playboy Bunny," Debra said. "But I just can't place which one."

"You are all Playboy Bunnies," James agreed. "However, I'm just glad that our pod will be the healers of this new little world we're building. Now that our proto-mer organs have developed, I can, for example, verify that the lovely Elise is, in fact, a doctor, without her having to tell me."

"Really?" Elise asked, furrowing her brow, and focusing on James. "Oh, my. It works, we're starting to bond."

"Yes," James agreed. "And I hope that our mer-learning will help Debra and Bridget become healers as well."

"I think it will," Bridget said, smiling at her former lover who was now her pod-mate. "Elise, you always said my spirituality was actually an instinct to try to heal the world. But I hope that when I know all the anatomy you do, I won't lose my spirituality."

"Perhaps we will gain some of yours," Elise said. "I might tease you, but I think a little reverence for the mysterious is a good thing. I just can't stand your brother's inflexible ideology."

"You mean Cory right?" Debra asked.

"Yes, I only have one brother now," Bridget said with a smile. "I love having a new sister, and soon I'll have another one, right?"

"Yes," Debra said, her eyes shining. "You nearly do."

"I don't think I would like your brother Cory very much," James said. "People who think they know all the right answers usually make the wrong diagnosis."

"Absolutely," Elise agreed.

"Oh, Debra, are you alright?" James asked as she rose up from his lap.

Debra nodded as she sat up a little, letting the water drain from her now very long, light brown hair. She looked closely at her new podmates, enjoying how very much attached she was to each of them.

James had her strongest bond, she felt. He was now a hale and hearty twenty-something with rich brown hair, sparkling blue eyes, and broad, well muscled shoulders. Bridget, Debra decided as she turned her attention to her, favored her sister, Pat, with rich brown/auburn hair that shimmered between red and brown, with bright hazel eyes.

Like Pat, she had a generous figure with high, full breasts, a very small waist, and wide womanly hips. Elise was slimmer than Bridget with long, thick, straight blond hair, rich brown eyes, and a long, slender body with full generous hips. Her medium breasts were high and tight, with small tight nipples. Her legs were long and elegant, and it was hard to think of her as a medical doctor, standing next to Bridget in the hot tub perched on the side of a volcano in the middle of paradise.

"Lisa Matthews!" Debra said, smiling.

"Who is Lisa Matthews?" ask Elise. "I don't have any cousins or nieces named Lisa."

"She was a Playboy Bunny from the early 90s," Debra explained. "You look just like her."

"I think they are called Playmates," James corrected.

"Well, Playmates or Bunnies, it doesn't matter to me," Elise said. "Besides, you look like one yourself."

"I think she is finally cooked," Bridget said.

Debra looked down at herself. Bridget was right; she was now a she, only this time all the internal plumbing worked! She secretly wished for a mirror so she could see what she finally looked like, but she didn't want to leave the hot tub. She was glad her breasts had returned, though now they were much larger, and they felt softer and fuller. Her nipples were significantly larger, and now that she had raised herself out of the warm water, they were getting pleasantly stiff in the evening air.

Below her out-thrust breasts, she could both see and feel her waist was much slimmer, but the biggest difference was that her hips were much, much wider than they were before the change. Her legs were still long and sleek, but now there was a two-inch gap between them at her crotch. Her legs did not meet until her knees. Another big difference was feeling her own blond hair falling the length of her back, brushing the top of her now generously proportioned ass.

"What do I look like?" She asked, timidly.

"You look like a mix of yourself, Bridget, and Elise," James answered. "You've still got your own face and lovely brown eyes, but you've inherited Bridget's top half and Elise's lower half."

"Hey, why didn't I get bigger breasts?" Elise teased.

"Because both James and I like them the way they already were," Bridget said. "Besides, one of us had to give Petra a run for her money, and it wasn't going to be me."

"But your breasts are larger than they used to be," Elise said, hefting one in her hand.

"Well, I wonder who was doing that to me?" Bridget asked, appraising first James, then Debra, and then her lover. "I keep forgetting that when we were younger, Elise was such a breast hound."

"Yea, too bad, huh?" Elise teased.

"I'm grateful to you, Elise," Debra said as she softly stroked her new breasts. "I'm just so happy to be complete and whole."

"I think that James might have had a hand in the final size of your breasts too," Elise said.

"I was a fan of Sophia Loren," he admitted, smiling.

"You're going to have to stop doing that," Bridget said, watching her own breast move as Elise continued to gently lift and squeeze her.

"Why?" Elise asked slyly.

"Because ... " Bridget answered as Elise grabbed her and kissed her soundly. They folded their bodies into one another's and began to kiss in earnest.

Debra felt her own breathing laboring, watching the two long-time lovers make love. Her own insides had finally settled down, and grew aware of a different sensation rising from her crotch as Bridget and Elise continued to stroke, hug, and kiss one another. After a few more minutes, she felt a throbbing emptiness, a sweet dampness, and a gentle swelling—all at the same time. They had worked their hands in one another's crotches, stroking and teasing, while they kissed and licked one another's lips, necks, and faces. She looked back at James, who was also watching Elise and Bridget make love. Debra could see his now larger penis rising up beneath the water.

She turned to face him, feeling her large, soft breasts shift on her chest. She reached out and gently grasped his erection, pulling him towards her.

"You're sure, my dear?" he asked.

"Oh, yes, please yes!" she pleaded, working her way towards one of the sides of the tub. "I'm cooked ... all done ... I can tell."

"If you're sure," James said, his own breathing rising with passion as the sounds of sex filled his ears. Elise and Bridget were each urging one another onward, cooing, moaning, and kissing.

Debra felt the edge of the hot tub against her now full and firm ass, and pushed with her toes, lifting herself up onto the smooth, warm rock surrounding the tub. She twisted her wide hips back and forth, scooting backwards, enjoying how each jiggle of flesh reminded her of her own dramatic transformation. When she was firmly on the smooth rock, she lifted her knees exposing herself to James. She was still holding his penis, so placed it at the entrance to her flowering sex. When she felt his swollen crown on her equally swollen labia, his stiff flesh touching her there for the first time, a burning wave of desire swept through her.

"Now, please now," she urged, letting go of his penis and leaning back on both her hands, arching her body onto his flesh colored spear.

She felt his stiffness slide the first inch into her, and locked eyes with him. She let her knees fall further apart, marveling silently at how easily they did that. She lifted her chest, watching with satisfaction as his eyes were drawn to her shifting mounds of flesh. She rolled her shoulders, making them slide back and forth across her ribs.

"More," she urged. "Really, I'm really ready."

"Yes, my dear," James agreed, and pushed into her slowly.

She gasped as his second inch entered, and they both felt the barrier of her own hymen stopping him.

"More," she hissed, her breath labored. "Do it."

James wrapped his hands under her knees, holding them apart and pulling her legs up towards him. He backed out from her vagina just a little bit, and then with a slight grimace of effort, slammed into her.

"Oh, god!" she cried, feeling both pain and pleasure rip through her, searing lightening bolts of sensation rocketing in all directions over her torso.

"Oh, god," James panted, feeling the molten heat of her virginal tightness.

Debra lifted her hands and grabbed James' arms, holding herself in a V, as he rocked her body back and forth over the fulcrum of her newly bountiful ass. She could feel her entire body shake as James' hips slammed into her own, and she gripped his forearms tightly, feeling the power of his strokes both in her pelvis and in her arms. Together, they started grunting, the water splashing up and spraying both of them as James plunged his body into hers.

Debra could hear all four of them moaning, and began feeling the steely vibrations of an orgasm rising up from her brand new womb. Her grip on his forearms tightened even further, her moans rising to screams of passion, urging James to go faster, deeper, harder. He did. The insides of her thighs begin quivering uncontrollably. A small bead of sweat formed on the end of James' nose, and watching it fall towards her breasts, she gave herself over to the tidal wave of pleasure rolling through her. Her toes clenched, her back arched, and her breasts shook, thrusting up towards James' now grimaced face. Her eyes rolled back in her head as she struggled to contain the force of the orgasm, her body involuntarily twisting and twitching as the pleasure raced through her.

James watched the beautiful creature beneath him lose control, her face twisted in an expression of purest joy, then he felt a twinge of aggression clench deep behind his cock, and gave a particularly forceful thrust into her shaking body and erupted inside her throbbing vagina. They both remained frozen together, un-moving except for their struggled breathing and Debra's still twitching legs. They didn't release their grip on one another until they felt the feather light touches of their pod-mates upon their now newly formed gill fronds along their backs.

"God, what a night!" Janice exclaimed, stretching like a cat in the morning sun.

"Yes," Hank agreed, watching his beautiful wife bend her body back and forth. "That was one of the best nights of sex we've ever had."

"I bet Julie and Brian were jealous," Janice said.

"They sounded like they were having a good time too," Hank said, casting a glance to the beach hut several meters from where he lounged in his own doorframe. "And it looks like they haven't woken up yet."

"Good, because now you owe me an answer to my question from last night," Janice said, settling herself back down next to him.

"Alright. Here goes," Hank said, taking Janice's hand in his. "Whatever it is that you want me to become, I will. I only know that I want to be with you forever, as man or mermaid, I no longer care."

"Oh, Hank! I will spend the rest of eternity making sure that your trust in me was the right thing to do," Janice said, nearly squealing with delight.

"Good," Hank said, kissing her, feeling her body mold itself into his as they kissed.

"But, you have to do one thing for me," Hank said, when they broke their kiss.

"Anything," Janice said, her eyes bright with emotion.

"I can't do it," Hank said in a whisper.

"But you just said that ... " Janice protested.

"No," Hank silenced her with a fierce whisper. "I just can't make myself submit to Brian. You have to do it for me, tie me up or something, I don't know."

"Oh," Janice said quietly, understanding.

She looked at the other hut to see if anyone had stirred. Nothing. She turned back to Hank, searching his face for clues as to what she should do or say. His blue eyes, so like Kate and Ann's, were clear and bright; he wasn't lying. He just couldn't bring himself to take the first step. She thought how he might look like his own daughters, and had to take a breath to contain her excitement. She and Julie had long planned on how they would make Hank turn, but now she had to adapt her plans to Hank's acquiesce.

"How soon, do you think?" she asked.

"Right now," Hank said. "Before I have any more time to think about it."

"Well, we do have to wait for James and his girls to finish changing," she reminded him.

"Yes, but it only takes minutes now," Hank said. "The longest part of the process is the long swim to the Moon Pool from the lagoon."

"Other than the day or two for the three feedings," Janice agreed. "How long since they left?"

"About an hour ago," Hank said. "They should be back any time now."

"You forgot about the transformation orgy," Janice reminded him.

"Oh, right," Hank said. "Well, then I guess we've got some time to kill. Crap."

"Do you want to talk about it?" Janice asked. "You know, have a little input in what you will become?"

"Janice, I can't," Hank said. "I'm giving myself to you, don't make me do more than I can."

Janice smiled at her husband, seeing the conflict he felt. She kissed him again, putting all the passion she could muster into it. When she felt his body relax and respond, she broke away.

"Stay here," Janice said, rising. "I'll be back in a little bit."

Janice scampered over to the other beach hut and poked her head through the curtains. Julie and Brian were entwined together, still sleeping. It had been days since anyone wore any clothes, and the sleeping couple looked like a sexy tourist advertisement. She entered the hut and nudged her sister's foot.

"Whaaa?" Julie asked.

"Get up," Janice said softly. "We have some planning to do."

Julie blinked open her eyes and sat up. "He said yes?" she asked.

"Yes," Janice said.

"Who said yes?" Brian asked, yawning.

"Don't worry about who said yes," Julie said, rising. "You just make sure you do what you're told when you're told to do it. Got it?"

"Yes, boss," Hank said sleepily, rolling over to the warm spot on the fronds that she had just left.

The two women smiled and left the hut for a walk in the jungle.

Debra's back was arched, her arms were outstretched, and her long pink tail with its green fringes and fins shimmered above her tilted back head. Her long, thick hair had lightened even more so that it was more of a pale, honey blond than a light brown, and it floated in the water around her face and shoulders. The intensely pleasurable grip of her transformation suddenly released its hold on her body, and she relaxed.

She looked around the Moon Pool as the other pods began to collapse onto themselves in a swirl of color and milk. She saw her own pod come towards her, everyone now complete. James was now an incredibly chiseled merman, with a long dark green tail fringed with light green highlights. Green, he had explained when he was changed, was the traditional color of healers. His long brown hair framed a handsome face with bright blue eyes, a generous mouth, and a strong chin. Elise complimented her fellow healer, her long tail shimmering in a pale, light green while her fringes and fins were highlighted with dark green. Her rich brown eyes sparkled with new light, and her long blonde hair was still straight as a string, but thicker and richer than it had ever been before. Bridget now looked more like her sister Pat, both her sea green tail with pink fringes and her long now more-auburn-than-brown hair nearly matching the family coloring. Debra sighed with enormous contentment. The mere sight of her pod thrilled her; they were surely the most handsome and prettiest mers of all.

"Now you're totally cooked," Bridget said, floating to a stop next to Debra. "Completely done."

"Completely female," Elise agreed.

"Completely mermaid," James added, his new long penis stiffening towards her.

"I'm the luckiest mermaid in the world," Debra said, reaching her arms out to enfold all three of her pod-mates. "I'm so bloody lucky!"

"We are all very lucky," James agreed, positioning his cock at the entrance to Debra's vent.

"Absolutely," Elise agreed, as she and Bridget positioned themselves on James' vibrating pelvic fins.

"Yes," Debra sighed, as she closed her eyes, savoring the long delicious stretching of her womb as James slid into her.

"I think I might have a solution," Annette offered.

"We're open to anything at this point," Joy said, holding her stomach while trying not to throw up.

"You have convinced us that just jumping into the sea and hoping for a miracle is a bad idea," Mac said. "We don't know what the microorganisms are doing to us, and we need time to sort these things out. So, we need a haven, a hideout, a something. What have you got?"

"I worked with an amazing computer analyst a few years ago," she said. "His name is Jackson Baker, and he is sort of an odd duck."

"Water birds; that's a positive sign," Mac joked.

"Well, his family owns this amazing place on the Chesapeake Bay," she continued. "He regularly invites Brent and I to spend a few weekends a year with him. It's a private island, about four acres, and it looks pretty non-descript."

"No, gaudy McMansion?" Joy asked.

"No," Annette answered. "Completely normal sort of place, but still, it's a private residence on a private island in the middle of the largest estuary in America."

"What do we want with an island in the Chesapeake?" Mac asked, his face showing the strain his body was enduring. "It's fresh water, and we need sea water, according to the last message from Pat."

"True, it's not sea water, but it's close," Annette answered.

"I don't get it," Mac said. "You'll have to explain it to me."

"The island is in the lower part of the bay, near the polyhaline zone, which basically means that the surrounding water is almost as salty as sea water," Annette continued. "His family was very rich, and he is the only heir. For the past five years, he has lived alone on this island, pursuing his only passion."

"Computers?" Joy guessed.

"Cuttlefish," Annette explained. "He converted one of the out buildings on the island into an aquarium housing his prized collection of cuttlefish. He breeds them for aquariums all around the world, but he lets very few people onto his island."

"Why would he let us share his island?" Mac asked.

"He is older than we are," Annette indicated Brent and herself. "And he gets lonely. We are the only people he trusts, actually. I believe we can trust him, and he would be intrigued by the possibility of joining his friends."

"Um, becoming a squid," Mac scoffed. "That's crazy. Besides, we don't even know what will happen to us. I don't want to risk becoming a squid. I'd rather just head for the beach and start swimming."

"That's dumb and you know it," Joy said. "We can barely make it through a day without collapsing. How are we going to swim, find food, and survive while these damn bugs have their way with our bodies? We need to be in a sheltered place while this fucking process either transforms us or kills us."

"Why didn't we drink any mermaid milk when we had the chance?" Mac complained.

"Because we were going to try to make the major powers leave Mermaid Island alone," Joy reminded him. "Now that they have a MAD device, we can try to make sure that you and I don't die. Personally, a weekend on a private island on the Chesapeake sounds like a perfect vacation, if you get my drift, and I think we should go."

"I'll call Jackson right now," Annette said.

"Do it," Mac said as he groaned in pain, holding his left hip. "I feel like my bones are just crumbling within me. Godddaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmnnnnnnnnnn !"

"Pat was wrong about the microorganisms time-table," Annette said. "You guys don't have weeks; you've got hours."

Malaki Dimaunahan looked at the thin, gaunt man standing in the middle of his office, looking for any reason to doubt the story he had just told. The small-framed man visibly shook in the presence of the rich and powerful head of the largest crime organization in the Philippines and Malaysia, but Malaki could see nothing but fear and truth in his eyes. He leaned forward and pressed a button on his desk phone.

"Miss White, please have my son Torro sent to see me immediately," he said into the speakerphone.

"Yes, sir," the cultured, British voice answered.

Malaki leaned back in his chair, looking out the bank of windows at the sky and view his office enjoyed. The 78th floor of the Petronas Towers commanded an impressive view of Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding countryside. He thought for a few minutes about the various clues he had before him.

First, the old man claimed he was forced to be a courier for a smalltime drug gang, wanting money for the safe return of his personal secretary, Sudhish Basra, who was becoming something of a risk. The ransom amount was substantial, far beyond the normal asking price for an executive secretary to a businessman. Whoever had taken Sudhish, had a better understanding of his secretary's real value than most of the small time drug gangs who performed these types of kidnappings as a sort of fundraiser.

Second, this man "Conjo" had worked in the building for years, a custodial worker working for the Petronas subsidiary servicing the needs of the clients, like himself, who occupied the second tower. The report he had called up on his computer showed that the fearful man had worked there for years, and there was every reason to believe that this shadowy and as yet unnamed rival gang had, in fact, used him as a blind mule.

Third, Sudhish, despite his search for his sisters, which was understandable if regrettable, had otherwise been an important part of Malaki's recent operations and had significant knowledge of his businesses, practices, and locations. Sudhish would be a valuable resource for such a gang, and could probably be induced to give his information for the price of finding his sisters. Damn!

"Miss White," he barked, punching the button.

"Yes, sir?" a voice asked.

"Confirm immediately with Kolkata that the Basra girls are still working at the Colonial House," he ordered.

"Yes, sir!" the voice answered.

Malaki's face remained perfectly still as an internal rage swept through his mind. Bastards! If all this was true, that a rival organization was attempting to muscle in on his white slavery trade in the eastern territories, and had kidnapped Sudhish Basra, his most recent personal assistant, and tortured him for key bits of information, then Malaki's business files and off-shore banking activities could be seriously compromised. Malaki decided on a test.

"Is there any reason I shouldn't throw you out from this tower?" Malaki asked Conjo who stood fearfully in his office.

"Every reason, your excellency," Conjo said in a quavering voice. "I am more useful to you alive than dead. Your enemies paid me to deliver this message, and if I am never seen again, they will know that you are afraid. If you send me back out, I will tell them that you laughed at me, and they will be afraid. I can try to tell you where they have a base of operations."

Ha! Malaki thought to himself, his face remaining an unmoving mask. More likely that this small man would turn tail and run for safety. Actually, a tail on this thin man might lead to more information, he thought.

"You have a point, especially since Mr. Basra is of very little use to me," Malaki said in a honeyed voice. "If you will give me a minute?"

Conjo nodded, happy that this part of his plan seemed to be working.

Malaki pushed another button on his phone. "Abdullah, bring me a Maumag. I have someone who needs a monkey on his back."

"Yes, sir," the male voice answered.

"I will let you go," Malaki started, but held his hand up to silence Conjo as he started to thank him. "But, you will wear a small trinket that carries a powerful charm for bad luck. You will give this trinket to the men who hired you, yes?"

"Oh, yes sir!" Conjo answered, delighted that Malaki obviously thought he was nothing but a country rube.

Hank watched as Pat and Phoebe salamandered back into the water, still tasting the delicious milk Pat had shared with him. Further down the beach, he spotted Galina and Petra joining them in the water, and he knew that Julie and Brian had also had their third feeding. His heart pounded in his chest, and wondered what would happen next. He knew something was going to happen, but Janice had given him no clue as to what to expect. He looked down over his naked body, enjoying the youthful energy and vitality he now felt.

"You look better now than you did in college," Janice said, emerging from the hut where she had drunk from Phoebe's breasts.

"So do you," he remarked, watching his now young looking wife walk towards him. All signs of aging had vanished. Her dark brown hair was longer, thicker, and shone with health. Her body was sleek and smooth, nut brown from the sun, and her breasts were high and firm, her brown nipples crinkling with excitement.

"Let's go up to the mountainside huts," Janice said, holding out her hand to help him stand.

"Are we ... " Hank began.

"No questions," She admonished him. "That was part of the deal."

Hank took her hand in his, and looked into her beautiful brown eyes. They were so big, he thought to himself, and now they looked just like they did back in college: big, intense, and filled with a whisper of innocence and a healthy dose of seduction. He squeezed her hand, feeling the same flutters of excitement he felt when they first met.

"You're in charge," he said, as they began walkiing together up the mountain path.

Pat looked around the large sand bowl lying at the center of their lagoon. She remembered the day she and Danni first stayed in the water on their own, and the fantastic sex they had enjoyed. She looked down at her sea green tail, shimmering in the dappled light sparkling around her. Her pink fringes and fins were fluttering in the water, keeping her stationary as her daughter, Maureen, swam circles around her long tail. Never again would she have legs, she thought ruefully, but she didn't think that she would ever really miss them.

Cynthia and Freya suddenly zipped towards her, joining their sister in a game of ring-a-round the mommy, and Pat, knowing Phoebe and Danni were close by, waited for them to appear. She sensed them just beyond the lip of the bowl, gathering food. She also sensed John, out beyond the barrier reef protecting their lagoon. He was with the other mermen, training James in the ways of mer-martial arts. Her pod-mates appeared at the rim of the bowl, swimming around a large elk coral, laden with food.

Pat admired, yet again, the beauty of her sister-wives swimming slowly towards her. Phoebe's nearly white, blond hair flowing gracefully along the length of her back, her sea-blue tail undulating slowly as she made her way towards the lip of the sand bowl. Pat watched as Danni's wide hips arced up towards the surface as she swam over the lip and headed down towards the spot where Pat waited. Her golden hair caught the sun's light and flashed with electric highlights, matching the metallic, golden sheen of her long tail, pushing her along the sides of the sand bowl.

Danni handed her an oyster, Pat effortlessly inserting a fingernail along one ruffled edge, and giving a quick twist. The sweet oyster opened with a snap, and Pat quickly ran her sharp nail along the edge where the muscle held the oyster tight to its iridescent home. She freed the body from the shell, lifted it up, sucking it into her mouth like a string of spaghetti. Ah, that was so good! The only reason to add lemon or hot sauce to an oyster, she thought to herself, was because landlubbers couldn't get them fresh. The only absolutely fresh oyster you could have was the one you ate while still in the water.

It reminded of the first oyster she ever ate, when she was both a boy and a kid. On a family trip to Disney World, they tried their first "east coast" seafood dinner. The thick-shelled oysters in the Gulf of Mexico were not as sweet as the Japanese oysters native to this part of the Pacific, but were firmer and plumper, and she missed them. On the other hand, the Japanese Oysters living along the western arm of their lagoon weren't as finicky as the Eastern Oysters she knew as a child, and tolerated the higher salinity of these waters. The small stream creating this estuarial lagoon wasn't big enough to keep the salinity low enough for those Atlantic animals.

Pat looked down and laughed, watching Maureen struggle to open an oyster on her own. She reached down, quickly cracking open the shell and handing it back to her infant daughter. Maureen inelegantly pried the poor creature out from its shell, and shoved it into her mouth, chewing with her small teeth before swallowing it with a smile. All their kids had taken to eating adult food very quickly, though all of them still fed on mermaid milk as well.

What was the appropriate length of time to nurse a mermaid child, Pat wondered. She knew she would never dry up, and so the decision to stop nursing was not one her body was going to dictate. She looked over at Phoebe who was now nursing Cynthia, and caught her eye.

[How long do you think we will be nursing this brood?] She asked.

[Huh, I hadn't thought about it,] Phoebe admitted.

[Exactly,] Pat agreed, gathering Maureen up into her arms, bringing her child's lips to her own breast. [We are not going to dry up, I suspect, since our milk production is independent of our pregnancies.]

[Perhaps they will let us know,] Danni offered, looking down at Freya as she suckled at her own, long nipples. [They'll just not want to nurse any more.]

[That is probably a very good plan,] Pat agreed. [Too bad we can't let more things like that happen that way.]

[Mother Nature always knows best,] Danni opined.

[What are you worried about now?] Phoebe asked.

[Hey, aren't you supposed to be on CHEW rest?] Danni worried.

[I'm fine, fully recovered,] Pat said. [REALLY, I am fine.]

[Well?] Phoebe repeated.

[We seem to be creating a new society here, and our organizational structure is primarily the pod,] Pat explained.

[And?] Phoebe pressed.

[That will probably be fine for a while, but complex organizations cannot be run like a family,] Pat said.

[Why not?] Danni asked. [Our family gets along great.]

[I know we do,] Pat agreed. [But imagine if we have over 100 mers here at Mermaid Island. That will happen someday. How will we insure that there is enough to eat? What will we build, now that we know that we can polymerize nearly any underwater structure we can imagine? Who will decide where those structures go? What happens to mers who cannot fit inside the Moon Pool for sleeping? Who will protect them from natural predators while they sleep? What about ... "

[Alright, alright!] Danni said. [I get the picture. We have a lot of thinking to do, but why are we the ones who have to answer those questions?]

[Because we are the ones who started it,] Phoebe said.

"Hi Hank," Julie said, her body seductively reclined on the bed Pat and John had first shared two and a half years ago.

John had built a good bed, it was large and comfortable, and Julie looked like a painting as she laid upon the woven palm fronds. Her youth had been restored, and her compact body was firm and beautiful. Like her sister, Julie's dark hair had grown longer, and her breasts had risen and become firmer. But on Julie's shorter frame, the hourglass curves both girls possessed looked more dramatic on her. Hank's penis twitched.

"Where's Brian?" Hank asked nervously, looking around the hut for his brother-in-law.

"Not here," Janice said as she pushed her husband into the hut. "It's just the three of us."

"But what ... "

"No questions!" Janice said, joining her sister on the bed and holding her arms out to him. "Come to bed and make love with us."

Hank gazed down at the two lovely creatures who both beckoned to him. He knew that, on the one hand, to join them now was to start a journey ending in him losing his manhood. On the other hand, and this was the hand that his self-destructive penis was voting for, the woman whom he loved more than life itself was saying "Oh, god, please fuck me now," and so was her sister. He wavered where he stood.

"Hank," Julie pleaded. "Please ... we want this, we want you. Join us. Please."

Hank looked down, seeing the same look of love and desire in both of their faces. Their dark eyes were full of anticipation, and their bodies flushed with desire. There were a thousand questions he wanted to ask, rules to know about, and rules he wanted to dictate for himself. But his cock kept up its steady rise, and knew he could not refuse these two. Knowing he would be changed forever, but determined to be with Janice forever, he lowered himself onto the bed between the two women.

The three of them lay together for several minutes, both girls slowly and sensuously stroking his torso, his thighs, but never touching his cock. He was as hard as he could recall himself ever being, but held his body absolutely still, giving them complete control.

"Relax," Janice said. "I love you, and I won't let anything bad happen to you."

"I'm not ... " Hank began.

Julie leaned over and kissed him, snaking her tongue into his mouth. Her thick hair fell over his face, now smooth from the effects of the three feedings of mermaid milk they had all consumed over the last twenty-four hours. Both girls began to play with his cock, and when Julie broke off her kiss, Janice replaced her sister's lips with her own. With a final nip, Janice broke off her kiss and gave Hank's cock a good squeeze.

"One last time," Janice said.

"Or one first time," Julie said with a smile, leaning down to take Hank's cock in her mouth.

Hank's eyes rolled back in his head as he felt his sister-in-law's warm mouth slide down his stiff cock. He moaned as she began to stroke his cock with both her mouth and her hand. He could feel his orgasm starting to rise quickly, spurred on by both Julie's skill and by the incredible feelings of fear, anticipation, and uncertainty roaring through his brain. He felt breathlessly out of control, barely able to stop his body from running from the hut and yet unable to even raise his hands from the death grip he had on the bed. Janice began to kiss his neck and face.

"Give it to her," she hissed. "Let it go!"

Hank groaned again as Julie doubled her speed and efforts on his cock. His orgasm rose up with unexpected fury and force, and he shouted out as he spurted into Julie's mouth.

"Yes, again," his wife whispered in his ear.

And again, he groaned as his groin convulsed and pushed another hot stream into Julie's mouth. His legs were stiff with the effort, and his hips lifted off the bed. Julie never broke her rhythm, her hand and lips a blur over his cock.

"Yes, again," his wife whispered again.

This time, the knot at the base of his cock felt like molten metal, and it burned as it rose up through his cock and splashed into Julie's mouth. He collapsed back onto the bed, his chest heaving with passion. Julie slid up his body and held her chin directly over his. Janice joined her, and together they kissed deeply, Hank's cum dripping from their kiss onto his face and lips.

Hank had tasted his own cum on his wife's lips before, so it didn't surprise him. Both girls bent down and kissed and licked his face, forcing his mouth open and letting some of his own cum ooze into his mouth. After a few minutes, the three of them had kissed and licked each other clean.

Julie turned, reached under the bed, and brought up a battered Russian canteen. She opened the container and lifted it up in a salute.

"Cheers," she said, and took a healthy swig. She handed it to her sister, who sat up, her breasts swaying as she rose.

"To sisters and sister wives," Janice said, and she took a long pull at the bottle. She held it out to Hank.

Hank too sat up, crossing his legs Indian style as he did. He stared at the bottle, and then looked at each girl. He looked around the hut, and still could not sense any one else's presence. He looked back at the canteen, and peered into the opening. A pale, white liquid sloshed back and forth in the bottle, and the faint, sweet smell of mermaid milk filled his nose. He could detect another smell, but it was hard to separate it from the smell of his own cum lingering on his face. He knew what was in the canteen. It was the same mixture of mermaid milk and merman semen that had changed his son. He knew that he would be forever changed if he drank from it.

"Janice, my love," he whispered, his voice shaking with a fear that he was embarrassed that he could not control. "I can't."

"I know my love," she said gently, and handed the bottle back to her sister. "Come here," she asked, indicating that he should lay his head down in her lap.

He turned onto his back and laid his head down in his wife's lap. He could smell her arousal, that sweet/acrid smell of a woman. He looked up at her breasts, now gently swaying above his nose, and her small stiff brown nipples. She cradled his head, and lifted him up so that his lips came into contact with her nipple, and he closed his eyes and began to suck. Janice moaned her approval of his gentle suckling, but nothing came out of her breast.

Hank then noticed a slight taste of mermaid milk, and sucked a little harder.

"That's it, baby," she urged. "Keep sucking."

Hank felt more liquid ooze into his mouth, and he began to suck a little stronger. There was more liquid, and some of it was dribbling off her breast and onto his shoulder. He continued for several minutes, but the milk was never more than a trickle.

"Enough, my love," she said, letting his head fall away from her breast.

Hank looked up at his wife, and saw out of the corner of his eye, her sister putting the canteen down at the side of the bed. His stomach lurched as he realized that she had been dripping the contents of the canteen onto her sister's breast, and he had drunk the powerful liquid. Janice recognized what Hank had concluded and pulled his face back to her breast.

"Don't fight it," she urged, her voice filled with emotion. "Don't move."

Hank tried to force himself to relax, and he put his arms around his wife's waist. He inventoried himself, but he couldn't find anything that felt different. Then he felt it; a slight tingling along the back of his throat, a tickle that ran up from his Adam's apple up into his brain.

"Oh, nooo," he cried softly.

"Just breathe," Janice said. "Stay calm. Everything will be all right. I love you."

Hank felt his stomach tighten again and bile rise up, burbling in his throat. He felt a wave of nausea sweep over him, and he rolled over to reach the side of the bed. He leaned over and felt a dry heave grip his abdomen, but his guts would not expel the liquid in his stomach. He rose up on his hands and knees, struggling to contain his nausea. Both girls scrambled to either side of him, and put their hands on his broad shoulders.

"Easy," Julie said. "Just breathe."

"I love you," Janice said, tears in her eyes as she watched the man she loved suffering this change for her.

Hank closed his eyes, and felt his stomach roll again in another dry heave, but nothing would come up. He was startled by the sound of a metal lid from one of the cooking pots drop onto the floor of the hut, ringing in the late morning sun. He realized that the girls had signaled Brian to emerge from his hiding place. He fell onto the bed and curled himself up into a ball, clutching at his stomach.

"I love you," Janice said, stroking his hair as he writhed on the bed. "Try to drink some more; it will help." She moved in front of him, kneeling on the floor of the hut, trying to keep him calm.

Hank shook his head, fighting to contain his panic. He knew that his body was shaking for at least two reasons. First, whatever the siren cells were doing to his body was apparently causing him some discomfort, but secondly, and more importantly, the fear of what happening to him, to his body, threatened to overwhelm him. He barely heard Brain enter the room.

Julie looked at her husband as he entered. Like the others, he was now youthful and strong, his thick brown hair a bit shaggier and shinier. He was even broader shouldered than he had been, thanks to her nearly constant focus on making him stronger and bigger than Hank. He truly was a handsome man, and she knew that Hank would eventually come to love him. He was carrying a stretcher under one arm. He put the stretcher against the wall and walked to the side of the bed facing away from Hank's face. He stood there silent and unmoving.

Julie reached down and picked up the canteen. She handed it over to Janice, who poured some of the liquid onto a soft cloth that she used to wipe Hank's face, letting some of it dribble onto his lips. She kept doing this as Hank remained in a tight ball, his eyes clenched shut, his arms clutching at his stomach. After a few minutes, she looked up at Brian and nodded. Julie turned to her husband and began to stroke his cock.

"Just keep breathing," Janice said as she continued to keep Hank's face damp with the mixture. "Everything will be alright in a few minutes."

Brian looked down on his beautiful wife as she took his cock into her mouth. He looked over at his equally beautiful sister-in-law and his soon-to-be pod-mate. Then he looked down at Hank's back, and started to visualize Hank as a female version of himself. As his wife's efforts on his own cock increased, he felt a sense of power surge through his body. He narrowed his eyes, and bore into Hank's back, willing it to change into a long, slender, female back like Hank's daughter's, Kate and Ann. Just like Rose had favored Janice and Julie, Kate and Ann would inform how Hank would change.

Hank felt the tingling in his head grow stronger, and his sense of panic began to subside. He could feel the power of the siren cells he had already consumed be summoned to a new duty, and slowly his body started to relax. He heard Brian groan behind him, and knew that soon he would have to face him, but couldn't bring himself to move. Janice dribbled more of the mixture onto his lips, and he couldn't help but lick the moisture from them. He felt Julie scramble from the bed and come around to join Janice on the floor in front of him. He cracked open on eye, and saw that they were kissing. Janice then turned to him, and took his face in her hands, and lowered her face to kiss him.

He tasted another man's cum for the first time as Janice's tongue gently forced its way into his mouth. His saliva gushed as the foreign liquid entered, and he reflexively swallowed. Janice's lips left his and then Julie's replaced them. Her kiss was stronger, more forceful, and there was more of Brian's cum on her lips and tongue. He reflexively swallowed again. When Julie broke her kiss, Hank felt his entire body suddenly relax, as though a great pin had punctured all the fear and uncertainty he had felt. He blinked a few times, breathing gently, looking at the two women who peered compassionately at him.

He raised one hand from his stomach, and reached for the canteen in Janice's hand. She gave it to him and smiled. Without turning around, Hank lifted himself up on his other elbow, keeping his back to Brian, and brought the canteen to his lips. He gave a small sigh of resignation, and drank the remaining contents of the canteen. When he finished, he wiped his lips, and handed the container back to his wife.

"What's my name?" he asked.

"Jaclyn," she answered. "I love you, Jaclyn."

"I love you too, Jaclyn," Julie said.

"I'm working on it," a deep voice from behind him/her said.

"Two more days," Michael Thompson confirmed as he looked at his three future pod-mates who were seated around the small galley table of the Johanna. "We will assemble at this point," he put his finger at a blank spot in the ocean, about ten nautical miles east of Davao, "and finalize the plans for the rescue mission."

Leonard stared at the point on the map indicated by Michael's finger, wondering what it would be like to meet an actual mermaid. He didn't think at all about the dangers he may face in going to a backwater, sometimes lawless, part of the world to pluck several prostitutes away from pimps who might not want them to take their property away from them. He could only think about meeting the mermaids.

"Len?" the wiry old man sitting next to him prompted.

"Sorry, Peter," Len said, realizing that he was still holding the creamer for the coffee Peter hoped to drink. He passed the creamer over to the former scientist, and wondered what kind of mermaid Peter would make.

Over the last several days, the four of them had gotten to know one another quite well, and while no one had pressed him on the issue of gender change, Peter LaMond had made it quite clear he was looking forward to becoming a woman. A life-long loner, he had a successful carreer as a chemical engineer, but secretly he wanted to be a girl since he was a little boy. He never told anyone, however, not even his late wife. The only person he had ever told was his young cousin, Johanna Thompson. That improbable event had lead to his presence on the boat named for his cousin, and he couldn't be happier.

Len, on the other hand, hadn't so much as sought out this place on Michael's boat as had been accidentally thrust into it. He watched Peter drink his coffee and wondered if coffee played a role in the mers' lives. How much would he be giving up, he wondered. He shook his head. How much would he be gaining, he reminded himself. Long life, a feeling of belonging, and a great and grand adventure to complete a fantasy he had since he was a little boy.

He sipped his coffee and looked again at the map on the table. The ocean was so big, so enormous. As mers they could go anywhere, and they could do it on their own schedules, their own agendas. Well, they would have to keep themselves a secret. Len shuddered when he thought about what the world might do to them if they were discovered. Would the whole world want to become mers? God, that would ruin the whole appeal, as far as Len was concerned.

He looked up at Peter, Liz, and Michael. What kind of pod would they become? Liz looked like she had been a beautiful woman despite her handicap. She would make a strong willed and beautiful mermaid. But he and Peter; Len could not begin to think what kind of mermaid Peter or himself would become.

"Do the mers drink coffee?" Len asked no one in particular.

"I don't think so," Michael said. "I've never thought to ask. Perhaps later today when we radio in to Mermaid Island?"

"No, no," Len said, embarrassed he had said anything aloud. "I was just wondering. Don't waste precious time with ... what's her name?"

"Pat," Michael answered. "She's the head mermaid."

"They have a head?" Len asked.

"Well, she's the one who generally is the one who talks to me on the radio," Michael answered. "They don't talk about who is in charge. I think we'll learn a lot when we meet the others."

"How many mers are there?" Len asked.

"I'm not quite sure," Michael answered. "We are meeting twelve, and there are at least that many still on Mermaid Island. So, may be twenty or thirty so far. I really don't know."

"But we will still be among the first," Len observed.

"Perhaps," Michael said. "Why would that be important?"

"I was just wondering what everyone did, you know, to fill the time," Len said.

"What has that got to do with being among the first?" Liz asked.

"Well, I'm a lawyer by trade, Peter is a chemical engineer, Michael is a businessman, and you are a philanthropist," Len explained. "It's possible that each of us has important things we can contribute to this new society, right?"

"Ah, I think I understand," Michael said. "I think that you are going to be the first lawyer mermaid. You'll have a lot to contribute."

"Why wouldn't I be a merman?" Len asked. "I mean, why is that just the assumption, that I will be a mermaid?"

"It's not an assumption," Michael said. "It just makes sense to me, that's all. You don't have to change with us, you know. Maybe you can start a pod of your own with the prostitutes we are rescuing."

"Do you think so?" Len asked, not really sure how he felt about it.

"The future is full of boundless possibilities," Michael said with a warm smile. "I would like my old friend to be a member of my own pod, but I wouldn't dream of forcing you into anything you didn't want."

Len looked at Michael closely, surprised by the warm feeling of tenderness he felt. Why did Michael look so damned attractive, and why didn't he feel like he should immediately reject the notion of becoming a mermaid rather than a merman? Len closed his eyes and thought about all the things he was feeling.

"Thanks, Michael," he said after a moment. "You have always been a good friend. I'll keep that in mind."

"Good," Michael agreed. "Now, let's get this boat ship-shape for the next few days."

Jacyln's stomach flipped a little bit as she heard Brian's voice behind her. Yes, she thought to herself, she was a she now, whether she liked it or not. Her body was still very much male, but the tickle in her head had done its work, and there was no turning back now.

"I'm working on it," he had said, and the deep rumble of his baritone had sent an involuntary thrill through her body. Jaclyn closed her eyes, feeling the heat of Brian's gaze upon her still male back for the first time. She shuddered, knowing that his presence was shaping her, morphing her, changing her body into something new, something she had never known nor sought to know.

"Jaci?" his former wife asked, using the hard c sound, "can you sit up? We really should get to the hot tub."

"Jaci?" Jaclyn repeated, listening to the sound of the nickname his wife, now sister-wife, had chosen for him/her.

"Well, what do you prefer?" Julie asked. "Brian calls me Jules, you know?"

"No one calls me Jan," Janice quipped.

"Thank god you didn't want to call me Marsha," Jaclyn said. "I think I would like to keep it Jaclyn for now, though Janice can call me anything she likes. I want that to be special for a little while longer, you know."

"Of course," Julie answered. "I think that I would like the same thing, that only Brian calls me Jules. It makes a certain amount of sense to me."

"Thanks for understanding," Jaclyn said. "I think I can get up now."

Jaclyn swung her still male legs over the side of the bed and stood up between the two women. Then slowly, she turned around. Brian watched as the newly named Jaclyn turned around, moving with a fluidity that Hank never had. Her journey was already starting, and Brian felt the sense of power he had, build to even higher levels. As he looked at Hank/Jaclyn, Brian felt powerful, strong, and so very male. He was looking forward to making all three of these women adore him. He spread his legs, letting his still stiff cock point at the three ladies, well ... two ladies and one sort of lady. He put his hands on his hips and tightened his muscles in what he hoped was a sexy pose.

Jaclyn hid a smirk from her face with her hand, and noticed that Brian assumed she was blushing. She cast a sideways glance at Janice, and saw that they both shared the same conclusion. She received an elbow from Julie on her left, and redoubled her efforts to stifle a giggle. A new wave of nausea swept up from her gut, not from fear, but from the now speeded up changes coursing through her body. She staggered forward and put hand onto the bed to steady herself.

"Now do you understand why we asked you to bring the stretcher?" Julie asked. "Quick, let's get her up to the hot tub. We added some stuff to the water to help Jaclyn's change."

Brian responded instantly to Julie's request, turning to get the stretcher. He laid it down on the bed, and reached to help Jaclyn lay her still broad shoulders down onto the canvas covered frame. Jaclyn's shoulder burned where Brian had touched her, and could tell every contact was speeding her change. She groaned as a fresh wave of nausea rose up.

"Hurry," Janice urged.

The two girls picked up the end of the stretcher by Jaclyn's feet, while Brian took the heavier (for now) upper torso. The three of them picked Jaclyn up, worked their way out of the narrow door, and headed up along the jungle path towards the mountainside hut tub. In a few minutes they reached their destination, Jaclyn barely keeping herself from throwing up along the way. They swung the stretcher around so that Brian could back his way into the water, still holding the stretcher, and gently lowering her into the water.

Jaclyn felt the warm water caress her shoulders and felt the girls drop their end of the stretcher as soon as it hit the water. They clambered into the water on either side of him/her and supported her head and shoulders while Brian took the stretcher from the water and tossed it off to one side. All four of them were now in the hot tub, with Janice, Julie, and Brian surrounding Jaclyn.

Jaclyn lay peacefully on her back in the warm and gently bubbling water. The sky above was clear and blue, the mid-day sun beating down upon them. The water felt a little warmer than she liked, but then she supposed it could also be that the siren cells were hard at work in her body, metabolizing her own cells and rebuilding them into a new configuration. She felt Brian take a hold of her feet, and recognized that she was being held by all three of her new pod-mates. They remained silent, all of them focusing on the changes they were guiding in Jaclyn's body.

After many minutes of simply being together, the wave of pressures causing the initial feelings of nausea gave way to a different kind of pressure. Jaclyn could feel the bubbles around her body grow more intense, and it felt as if she was floating on a cushion of bubbles.

"What's happening?" she asked, surprised at how ragged her own voice sounded, halfway between a male voice and a female one.

"Pat gave me some new microorganisms to put into this hot tub," Janice explained. "They are the ones primarily concerned with changes in body mass and type, not species change. None of these microorganisms are the ones that carry the siren cell virus, so it should not cause a merchange to occur, only assist in a gender change. You, my darling, are the first to enjoy this benefit."

"What does that mean?" Jaclyn asked.

"That your primary transformation into my sister-wife should take a few minutes rather than a few hours, like Rose's," Janice explained. "We also hope that the colony of microorganisms we start here will become healing agents for those who are not going to become mers, but Pat says that there will be many more experiments to undertake before that can happen."

"What are you going to make me look like?" Jaclyn asked, feeling the energies stored up by the several feedings and the new microorganisms beginning to build up throughout her body.

"Like our daughters," Janice explained, kissing him. "You are still one of their parents, though now you'll be more like a mother than a father to them."

"Ohhhhhhh," Jaclyn moaned.

"What?" Janice asked.

"Bones ... hurt," Jaclyn gasped, feeling nearly every bone in her body being crunched into a smaller female configuration.

"Not as short, remember?" Julie said to Brian. "She's going to be a tall mermaid, not as short as her daughters."

"Right, sorry," Brian said, refocusing his mind on the task Julie and Janice were ordering him to follow. It was hard to get Kate and Ann's lovely figures separated from how tall Hank had been in comparison. He tried to focus only on things like shoulders, hips, and waists, but legs, arms, and torsos made their way into his internal fantasy.

Jaclyn felt some of the pressure lessen and the water continued to roil around her. She turned her head, feeling a new drag on her movements. Her hair must be growing at an astounding rate. She looked up at Janice and saw her sister-wife was looking at her with a radiance of love and compassion and gratitude never seen in her eyes when she was Hank.

"I love you," she struggled to say through lips and a face that felt like thick soup rather than flesh. "Tell me what's happening," she managed to force out through her changing bones and flesh.

"Oh, my beautiful Jaclyn," Janice said, her eyes wet with emotion, her face damp with the fine mist rising from the bubbling and roiling waters. "You're changing so quickly, and you're already so beautiful."

Jaclyn could feel confirmations of Janice's observations throughout her body. She suspected the siren cells and the new microorganisms were both consuming some of her own biomass to energize this quick change and expelling any excess biomass from her body. She didn't feel any pain now, but could still feel bones shifting, stretching, shrinking, and changing. Her head felt lighter, and she supposed it was smaller. Her lower torso felt heavier, and knew that her hips had expanded, as had her ass. Brian's grip on her feet had shifted to her calves, which separated her legs slightly, her feet now resting on either side of his hips. The thought of what that meant both terrified and excited her.

"Your penis is gone," Janice said, confirming what Jaclyn could feel already. "You're a few inches shorter than you used to be, but not much. You'll probably be the tallest mermaid we have. Your waist is so small, I hope it didn't hurt."

"No," Jaclyn said, feeling her body rushing to accept its new shape, her face finally feeling less like putty and more like a face. "It's happening really quickly; it doesn't hurt very much at all."

"Oh, I'm so glad," Janice said. "I was so worried, and so happy when Pat asked us to test out this new process."

Jaclyn felt Brian move his hands to behind her kneecaps, forcing her legs wider apart still. Her body now felt very feminine, her long, shapely and now very smooth legs resting gently along Brian's waist, her wide hips floating along the surface of the water, the bubbles teasing her crotch where she could feel her vagina still forming, her internal organs still moving around. Everywhere the thousands of tiny bubbles caressed her newly soft skin.

Suddenly she felt Julie and Janice each latch on to one of her nipples and begin to suck. The pleasure their sucking sparked laced through her body, causing her to arch her back, letting her hips sink into the water. The harder they tugged, the more it seemed her nipples began to grow, until she could clearly feel the large nubs her nipples had become being manipulated by their teeth and tongue.

The feelings were exquisite! Beneath those nipples she felt the siren cells push more of her own biomass up from her waist and into her breasts. With each passing second, a throbbing wave of pleasure increased in her chest as her breasts grew under the gentle manipulation of her sister wives. A secondary throbbing filled her crotch as her womb finished forming, her labia becoming swollen with the passions she felt running through her now changed body. Finally, the girls stopped sucking and stood up to see the results of their handiwork.

Janice looked down on her new sister wife, amazed at the beauty floating in the water beneath her. Jaclyn's wheat blond hair now spread out like a fan from her face, stretching out nearly a meter in every direction. Her blue eyes were enormous, generous pools of light, flashing azure, cyan, and cobalt around a coal back pupil. Her long, honey blond lashes curled away from her wide, innocent eyes. Her face was long with gracefully arched eyebrows, dramatic cheekbones, and wide, generous lips. Her neck was long and slender, giving way to still wide shoulders. Her arms too were slender and long, and the hand Janice now grasped in her own was beautiful. Jaclyn's fingers were long and topped with strong nails, now in need of some attention, being so new, they had not grown in evenly. She could also see the Jaclyn's index finger was longer than her ring finger, just like hers was.

Below her graceful but powerful shoulders rose two enormous breasts, much bigger than either hers or Julie's. They sat up cone shaped from her recumbent torso, still firm and high. At the center of each mound was a medium sized areola that was itself gently domed, with a large, thick nipple at its center. Jaclyn's nipples were larger than either hers or Julie's, and they mesmerized Janice. From her up thrust breasts, Jaclyn's waist dramatically narrowed, accentuated by her long torso, before flaring out into wide hips, again wider than Janice's or Julie's. Between her shapely thighs was nestled the puffy lips of a vagina, but there was no hair to be seen anywhere on her body except for her head and eyes. Janice followed Jaclyn's body downward, seeing how Brian had positioned himself between her legs, his stiff cock pointed at her newly formed crotch.

Brian felt Janice's eyes on his cock, and he looked up at his new sister wife. He felt relieved when Janice smiled back at him, gently encouraging the next step in their plan. He looked down at the now finished Jaclyn, admiring her lush body in all its glory. His cock felt painfully hard, and he hoped that Julie didn't yet have enough of a merbond with him to sense how much he wanted this amazing creature that even now smiled back up at him.

Something clicked inside Jaclyn's brain, and suddenly she understood how and why Janice and Julie had arranged everything as they had, and she was grateful for their understanding, kindness, and foresight. She gave Janice's hand a squeeze and knew that her sister-wife understood all those thoughts at once. She looked up at Brian and saw his slackjawed stare for the first time. Poor thing, she thought. He doesn't even know how much power I've gained. She looked back at her new sisters, and they all nodded silently.

"Brian?" she asked in her new, seductive, alto voice. "How'd I turn out?"

"Ahhh ... ummm," he stammered, overwhelmed by the sparkle of life in Jaclyn's eyes, and the charisma and raw sexuality flowing from them. She blinked at him, and suddenly he worried his cock might simply explode off his body.

"You like, old friend?" Jaclyn asked, enjoying the way she was making both him and herself feel.

She could feel her nipples tighten with excitement. She knew what a beautiful pair of breasts could do to a man, so let go of Janice's hand, and slid both hands up to her new mounds, cupping them and feeling their weight. She felt both Janice and Julie move their hands under her shoulders, supporting her weight in the water, allowing her the leverage she needed for her next move.

She looked up at Brian, seeing the need and lust in his eyes, enjoying the sweep of his eyes up and down her body. She lifted her calves a little and then crossed her ankles together behind his ass, forcing his hips closer to her own. His cock jutted out over her stomach, a few centimeters above the water, while she pressed her hips into his thighs, rocking her hips back and forth.

"Julie, I'm so glad you decided to share," Jaclyn said. "Look what a wonderful cock he has, it nearly reaches my belly button."

"Oh, my god yes," Julie breathed, taken up by the incredibly sensual sight of her former brother-in-law teasing her husband, now pod-mate to all three of them. "You'd better share with me, as well," Julie said, putting on hand on Jaclyn's breast, feeling the hard, thick nipple press into her palm.

"I have a feeling we're going to get along just fine," Jaclyn said. "Right my darling?" she asked, turning to face Janice.

Janice said nothing and lowered her head to kiss her beautiful sisterwife. Their mouths opened, full female lips sliding across one another's for the first time, Janice remembering her fantasies about her college roommate so many years ago. Jaclyn was every fantasy she ever had completely and excellently fulfilled. They broke the kiss, and Jaclyn moved her hips with greater urgency, making the water splash between her and Brian.

"Julie, would you do the honors?" she asked, her voice heavy with lust.

Julie took her hand from Jaclyn's breast and reached down to grasp her husband's long, stiff cock, a newly enlarged cock she had enjoyed earlier the previous evening while they listened to Hank and Janice make love. She knew from experience what a lovely feeling that long cock would cause, and her own vagina began to flower in anticipation of being next. She waited as Jaclyn used the grip Brian had on her thighs to leverage her heels higher on his back, and then watched as she lifted her hips out from the water so that they were even with Brian's waiting cock.

Jaclyn's body was on fire. She felt the blossoming of a void within her womb create a delicious need to fill that void. She waited until she felt Julie place Brian's cock at the entrance to her sex, and then tightened her strong thighs and calves, forcing his cock deep inside her. She gasped with delight and some pain as his cock slid past her brand new hymen, and bottomed out within her.

"Yes!" she gasped, feeling the tip of his penis rub on her cervix. She couldn't feel her cervix, only the internal pressure this cock caused by moving within her. She was nearly overwhelmed, however, by the new sensations emanating from her vulva and new clitoris. She tightened her legs around Brian's lower back, tilting her hips forward, and forced her clitoris to make contact with his body.

"Ahhhhhhhhh!" Jaclyn screamed, the pressure on her sensitive nub of flesh sending waves of sensation through her body, feeling her new muscles in her birth canal begin grabbing at Brian's thick cock. Her body took over, and her hips starting rocking up and down, forcing Brian's cock deep within her, pushing his cock back and forth across her G-spot.

"OH, GOD!" she shouted, using her legs to lift her body out of the water, wrapping her arms around Brian's shoulders as she rose up, pressing her body into his. Her hips were now a blur, as the vibrating waves of her first orgasm caused her hips to pulsate quickly over his, forcing his cock to beat the sides of her womb like a jackhammer.

"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes," she screamed like a barking dog, feeling her new breasts shake as her body quaked like a leaf in a thunderstorm in the throes of the greatest feeling of pleasure she had ever known.

Brian was completely unprepared for the force of Jaclyn's passion, and stood rock still trying to keep both of them from falling over into the water. Jaclyn's body was like warm, quivering, jelly as her orgasm forced her hips to piston back and forth on his cock. He could feel her birth canal clamping down on his cock, holding it so tight that it felt like she might pull it out at the root. Without warning, his cock erupted, and he groaned out in passion, his knees buckling as they both sank back into the hot tub.

Janice and Julie guided the sinking lovers down, supporting them as Jaclyn still hammered away at Brian's cock, her constant cries of passion growing in volume. Her hips pulsed like an electric toothbrush, vibrating on his now spurting cock. She could feel each twitch of his stomach muscles as each spurt rocketed into her hungry vagina. Her orgasm continued to blossom, never lessening, for a full minute, though it seemed an eternity, and then finally, it released her, and she collapsed into Brian's shoulder.

The two lovers slowly recovered, feeling the supportive hands of their two sister wives holding them and stroking them. When her breathing returned to something closer to normal, Jaclyn lifted her head and looked at her new pod-mate. Brian's eyes were shining in surprise, and she felt his still hard cock within her. She leaned forward and kissed him, tasting his mouth for the first time. She liked the way he tasted, she decided, but knew that Janice would hold for her a special bond for all time. She leaned back and turned to her former wife, and kissed her. She felt Julie press in on her other side and kiss Brian.

"When are we supposed to go down?" Jaclyn asked as she broke the kiss with Janice.

"As soon as we're ready," Janice said.

"You two ready?" Jaclyn asked Brian and Julie, interrupting their kiss.

"Yes," Julie said, her chest heaving with passion. "That was the most incredible thing I've ever seen, but the next time that cock goes anywhere, it will be in my mermaid's womb."

"That's a deal," Brian agreed, as he slipped out from Jaclyn. "Let's go."

Janice pulled at Jaclyn's hand, signaling her to wait, and together they watched as Julie and Brain rose from the tub, their beautiful bodies dripping with water, their skin shining in the sun.

"You coming?" Julie asked, noticing that the other two had stayed behind.

"Why don't you two get the huts presentable for Harold. We left everything something of a mess," Janice said.

"Oh, right," Julie said, remembering more of the details the plan she and her sister had worked out. "Come on Brian, let's let these two have some time to adjust to their new roles, and we can sort out the last of those explosives Harold was working on." She grabbed his hand and started back down the path. Brian gave one last look at the two beautiful women in the hot tub, and then followed his wife back down the path.

"How do you feel?" Janice asked.

"How do I look?" Jaclyn countered, her broad smile making visible how she felt.

"Probably as good as you feel," Janice said, turning their bodies so that they faced one another. "Do you understand, now?"

"Why you wanted this?" Jaclyn confirmed, sweeping her gaze down her own impressive body. Janice nodded, waiting.

"I think so," Jaclyn said, thinking aloud. "I was afraid at first, I admit that. But once I saw how the look in Brian's eye had changed, I understood what it means to actually be a beautiful woman."

"You're literally the combined fantasy of Julie, Brian, and myself," Janice agreed. "How could we not look upon you and not feel a bit helpless?"

"You don't feel helpless around anyone," Jaclyn teased. "You're still the most beautiful woman I know."

"You haven't seen a mirror," Janice said. "But I know you love me, and I can feel it much the same way I did before."

"How so?" Jaclyn asked. "I feel very differently about you now."

"Yes, but you're a woman now," Janice said. "Before you wanted me as a man. Now how do you feel?"

Jaclyn looked down at her former wife, noting that she was still taller than Janice. She looked at her eyes, and saw there the same look of desire, no ... a stronger look of desire than she had ever seen before. She felt her own breasts tighten again, even though she had only moments ago careened through the most amazing orgasm she had ever felt. She knew her body was ready to go, without a rest, and indeed, that she wanted to hold Janice and feel her body quake just like she used to. No, not just like she used to ... it was different.

"We can share it now," Jaclyn said, her eyes shining.

"We can share everything now," Janice said, reaching up to bring Jaclyn's lips to her own.

They kissed for many minutes, two beautiful women, standing in a low hot tub, perched on the side of a picturesque mountain in the south Pacific. Janice slowly guided them into the center of the pool, to a place where there was a slight depression. She guided Jaclyn to that small bowl, and guided her feet into it. Jaclyn was delighted to discover that now they were the same height, and that their breasts were now pressing into one another's.

"I love my new body," Jaclyn said as she lifted her head and watched as they pushed their breasts together. "My nipples are so sensitive, ah ... ah," she shuddered as Janice's stiff nipple caught on one of hers. "That feels so delicious."

"I know," Janice breathed, as she reached around Jaclyn's tiny waist and pulled her body towards hers. "It gets better," she said as she pressed her lips back onto Jaclyn's.

They continued to kiss, rubbing the length of their bodies across one another's. Jaclyn felt one of Janice's hands fall to her hips, and the trace its way toward her crotch. Jaclyn matched her sister-wife's movements, and soon they both found themselves pressed together, kissing, while their hands rubbed furiously at one another's clitoris's.

Jaclyn felt her body prepare for her second orgasm, and she tried to concentrate on Janice's body. Both of their hips were underwater, but Jaclyn could still feel a warm wetness oozing around her fingers as they flicked across Janice's clit. Janice pulled away from the kiss, gasping for breath, her own fingers growing jerky and random at Jaclyn's crotch.

"Yes, my darling, yes," she urged. "Right there, oh GOD!" Janice cried as her orgasm caused her to have a spasm against Jaclyn. Jaclyn's body responded as if triggered by an explosion, her hips thrusting against Janice's hand as her body took over.

"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yesssssssssssssss," Jaclyn cried as her second orgasm washed over her. "So good, so good, so good," she repeated, her body riding the crest of her orgasm for another minute, still keeping her own fingers moving over Janice's quivering vagina.

After several minutes, they both recovered, but they stayed entwined in the pool, stroking each other's breasts, neck, and shoulders lightly, and kissing softly and gently.

"Now how do you feel?" Janice asked.

"Completely in love," Jaclyn admitted, feeling the whispers of the proto-mer bonds beginning to form.

"What about Brian?" Janice asked.

"What about Brian?" Jaclyn asked.

"Do you love him?" she asked.

"I'm not sure," Jaclyn said. "It's not that I don't love him, I mean, he just fucked me. Wow, did you hear that?" "Yes," Janice said. "And it looked like you were having a great time. And then, we made love ourselves. Did it feel the same?"

"No, each felt different," Jaclyn said. "I feel different with you. I know I am in love with you."

"That will change," Janice said. "You know?"

"No it won't," Jaclyn said, kissing her sister-wife again. "I'll always feel slightly differently about you."

"No, I mean that eventually we will both love him," Janice said. "We won't be able to help it."

"Oh, that," Jaclyn agreed. "Yes, I know," she said as she turned and gracefully lifted herself out of the tub.

"And?" Janice prompted, holding up her hand to the Amazon beauty before her.

"That's going to be fine," Jaclyn said, pulling Janice from the tub. "As long as I always have your love first and foremost."

"Count on it," Janice said, smacking her lover's shapely and full ass as she kissed her.

The afternoon sun cascaded down the rock chimney, flooding the Moon Pool with light. A tall blond stood on the side of the pool, holding hands with a shorter, but still tall brunette. Behind them, a group of six mermen and two mermaids watched over a jumble of sleeping, infant mermaids. In the pool below, a new merman was born, his steel gray and green tail echoing his older brother's, who was currently helping Danni arrange their mermaid children in their sleep.

"Is he done yet?" John asked over his shoulder, sensing a change in the energy coming from the pool.

"Yes," Janice reported, reaching up to make sure her tiara was firmly in her hair. "We're almost ready to go."

"You two alright?" John asked as he salamandered past Liga.

"Yes, we're fine," Liga said, putting Buan next to Mari, both of whom were asleep. "You go into the water. Danni will join you as soon as we have all of the baby girls safe and sound."

"Right," John agreed, and flipped his tail so he cleared nearly three meters of rocky cave floor and sailed into the pool.

"Show off," Bill complained as he slid back into the water.

"It's Jaclyn, right?" Trevor asked as he salamandered up to the two human girls. The tall blond nodded. "Wow, you'll have to tell me about it later."

"I think you can learn everything you need to from my daughter Rose," Jaclyn said, smiling.

"Oh, I don't know," Trevor said. "I know a lot more about Hank's past than Robbie's," he teased.

"Which you'll take to your grave," Jaclyn said as she swatted at the broad shouldered merman.

Trevor ducked and slipped into the water, chuckling loudly. The rest of the mermen followed him.

"You ready?" Julie asked, rising from the water on her new tail, her brown eyes now gleaming with the multi-faceted streaks of mermaid's rods and cones.

Jaclyn and Janice nodded, looking at Julie's new powerful tail. She had gone first, then Brian so that Julie could be his only influence. Brian rose up beside her, his long black hair now down to his shoulders, hydrophobic-ally dry the moment he left the water, his strong, dark tail flashing in the brightly lit water.

"Pat's ready," Brian reported, signaling that everything was ready for this dual transformation. "You both remember you only to go to two or three moms; don't try to feed off of too many mermaids before you come to Julie and I."
"Yes, dear," Jaclyn said, smiling.

"I'm not going to lie," Brian said, smiling at Julie. "Hearing that from him ... er ... her will take some getting used to."

"There's a lot you're going to have to get used to," Julie said, kissing her pod-mate. "Our transition was beautiful," she told her sister wives. "The tiara's really help."

Pat broke the surface and looked up at Jaclyn and Janice. "Give us just another minute. We've got a wonky sensor." She ducked back under and swam towards the Lab Cave.

"Lab rats," Jaclyn said. "That's all we are; just lab rats."

Janice smiled, remembering how Pat had explained to them after they arrived at the lagoon, the scientists wanted to compare some data that had cropped up in Kate and Ann's dual transformation. The plan would be for Julie to go first, then Brian, each single transformation recorded and tracked. Then, Janice and Jaclyn would go together, like their children had before them, only this time with the full compliment of mers to speed their change. Pat had told them that she didn't know what the anomaly in the data was, but she hoped the data from their change could help figure it out.

"Hey, Mom!" Rose said as she broke the surface of the water. "We're waiting for you!"

"What about me?" Jaclyn asked, arching an eyebrow at her former son.

"That's what I said," Rose smiled. "Mom covers both of you now."

"She's got a point," Janice agreed, smiling at her beautiful sisterwife. "You're a mom now."

"Well, only technically," Rose said. "She's not really a mom until she gives birth to her first child."

"Hello! What's the hold up?" Kate asked as she and Ann surfaced next to Rose. "You guys chickening out again?"

"Where are the guys?" Jaclyn said, looking around the cave with a leer.

"Ha, ha. Not funny, MOM," Rose said.

"We're not chickening out," Janice said. "Pat asked us to wait a bit, something about a sensor."

"She's always doing that," Rose agreed. "So, Mom Two, are you excited?"

"Is that what I'm going to be called?" Jaclyn groaned. "Part Two?"

"Well, we could call you the new one," Ann said.

"Great," Janice said. "That makes me the old one. You'll pay for that one, my dear."

"I say one thing, and I'm the one in trouble!" Ann complained. "Why does that always happen to me?"

"Because you're the middle child," Kate said, giving her sister-wife a kiss. "But we love you anyways."

"Ready, all systems go," Pat said breathlessly, popping up near the edge of the pool.

"Let's go, my love. Let's join our children," Janice said, smiling at her daughters.

"Yes," Jaclyn agreed. "Let's."

All the mers flipped back under the water, leaving the two of them standing alone at the edge of the pool. Behind them, Danni and Liga finished settling down all the baby mermaids. Janice and Jaclyn looked down at their legs a final time and then—still holding hands—stepped into the pool. The water closed over their heads, and they slowly sank together until reaching the depth at which everyone else waited. Both girls felt their gill fronds begin working but knew they couldn't last long with out starting the change. Their gills were still underdeveloped. They turned and waved at their children, knowing they would not be feeding from any of them for this final feeding, they then gave each other's hand a squeeze and separated to opposite sides of the pool.

Jaclyn looked into the rich green eyes of Petra, who along with Galina would soon no longer be the longest/tallest mermaids of the group. She kicked her legs moving closer to the beautiful mermaid, noting that her own, brand-new-breasts were nearly the equal of Petra's and Galina's generous mounds. Hers, Jaclyn knew, were smaller than Petra's or Galina's both in over all mass and in the size of their areolas and nipples, but her conical shape made hers stick out further away from her ribs, and she was proud of how symmetrical and beautiful they were. So little time as a woman, Jaclyn mused to herself, and she was already thinking like a jealous high school girl.

"Petra, share with me your milk and give me my tail?" she asked.

"Drink from me, and become one of us," Petra intoned, enjoying the ritual they had developed over time.

Jaclyn sensed that Janice was doing the same with Pat on the opposite side of the circle as she closed her lips over Petra's enormous dark nipples. Petra's milk came quickly, and soon Jaclyn was struggling to keep most of it going into her own body. She finished with Petra and moved on to Galina, feeling the strength and power of the siren cells begin to build within her.

"Galina, share with me your milk and give me my tail?' she repeated.

"Drink from me, and become one of us," Galina said with the same solemnity.

Jaclyn found Galina's breasts less potent than Petra's, but remembered that Petra was a mother, making it a big difference. When she finished with Galina's however, she could tell that Brian was right; they were not going to need the contributions of everyone to make this transition. Pat had said to trust their own instincts, and Jaclyn found that her body was growing warm, and knew she should move to Julie. She turned her body and saw that Janice had come to the same conclusion. Together they swam towards their future pod-mates.

"Julie, share with us your milk and give us our tails?" they said together.

"Drink from me, and become one of us," Julie said, pushing her now larger chest towards her sister and sister-wife.

The two girls went to one breast each and began to suck. The bonds they had already created among one another caused Julie to feel intense pleasure as she fed her future mates. Her eyes rolled back and her body quivered in an orgasm, her black and green tail and flukes shaking with passion. Janice and Jaclyn felt the full power of the siren cells build within them, and then turned to Brian, his cock already stiff in the water, pointing between them.

"Brian, share with us your semen and give us our tails?" they asked together.

"Drink from me, and become one of us," he grunted, trying to hold back the imminent orgasm that threatened to go early.

Janice closed her lips around his now enormous cock, and immediately Brian started ejaculating. One, then two enormous pulses shot into her mouth, and she fell back and felt Jaclyn take over. Three, four, and then a fifth pulse shot into Jaclyn's mouth, each one sending a jolt of energy through her body. Together, the two girls stopped moving, their legs growing stiff and straight, while their arms rose outstretched to each side. They hung there for a second before Julie and Brian gently positioned the now helpless girls in the center of the pool.

For a moment, everything was still, and then the two girls began slowly spinning in the center of the pool. The sound of mermaids singing rose in the water. Julie and Brian backed away from the two proto-mermaids, joining the others along the wall of the pool, watching as thousands of tiny bubbles began to form around the two slowly spinning bodies.

Jaclyn sensed Janice floating in front of her, and sensed Julie and Brian finding their way back to the wall. She also could feel the water become infused with energy as the microorganisms began coalescing around her body. She tried to focus on Janice, but she could not see her nor yet sense her through the growing veil of bubbles rising around her. She discovered her arms were now stiff and outstretched from her body. She didn't recall ever moving them. Her legs, she felt, were trying to stretch themselves down towards the bottom of the pool. Everything in her body felt vaguely uncomfortable.

Great waves of energy crashed through her, and she felt a prick of pain as her leg bones were literally cut by the combined efforts of the siren cells and the microorganisms, new joints and bones being constructed even as her old ones were broken and reshaped. She could feel a sheath of skin form over her now fused legs, and her feet beginning to compress and squeeze out and away from her joined ankles. Like plastic pushed into a transparent mold, her new flukes fanned out below her, and felt the tickling of her new mer-senses come into focus as her fringes pushed out along the trailing edge of her flukes. She couldn't move anything, though she desperately wanted to feel her tail move in the water. She became aware of two new sets of fins, one at her knees and one at her hips, and those too gained the fringes helping her mer-senses come further into focus.

Another great wave of pressure passed through her, feeling her womb lengthen and change, her vagina pressing down further along her tail, and new vent flaps forming around her labia. Her hips grew wider still, and her breasts grew a little heavier, falling just a tiny bit further down her chest, losing their almost unnatural conical shape. She felt fins press out from her elbows, the texture of her skin changing. She could feel her hair brushing along her newly formed dorsal ridge, hair and fringes caressing one another. Her whole body felt as if a low grade current was buzzing through her, racing from one end of her body to the other. Every once in a while a zap of energy would erupt from a fin, fluke, or breast. And when it did, a million tiny mouths seemed to nibble at her body.

Suddenly, a great wave of pleasure gripped her entire body, and she arched backwards, her tail curling back over her head, its green scales and golden highlights shimmering above her face. Just like her daughter's she thought, her tail was just like theirs and she hadn't said anything about what colors she should be. Then, just as suddenly, the vice grip was released, and she relaxed in the water.

The bubbles slowly cleared, and she could see her new sister-wife floating next to her. Janice's long red and black tail mirrored their other daughter's coloring, Rose. Janice's body had matured into the dramatically shaped form of all mermaids, slightly larger breasts, wider hips, and strong tails that were double the length of their human torsos.

"Oh, my god," Janice said in her new, silvery voice. "You're so beautiful."

[So are you,] Jaclyn said, testing out her new CHEW.

They both sensed Julie and Brian as they swam to the center of the pool to join them, and they were also aware of the splash of two mermaids entering the water from above, driven to join their pods by the miraculous power of these transformations. All around them, pods collapsed onto themselves, the flashing lights of the mers' bioluminescence competing with the still bright sunlight that dappled the water of the Moon Pool. The sounds of passion, communicated both orally and via their CHEW filled the pool.

"We made it," Julie said, drinking in the sight of her beautiful pod. "We're mermaids."

"Yes," Janice said, smiling at her sister. "And now, we must bond."

"Over and over," Jaclyn said with a growl.

Janice and Jaclyn both grabbed one of Julie's pelvic fins and positioned her in front of Brian. Julie moaned in anticipation, watching with fascination as Brian opened his vent, his penis rising from within his long, powerful tail. Like a slowly telescoping arm, rather than a rising crane, Brian's cock continued to grow and thicken as it reached out for Julie's vent, which was also responding by swelling and opening, exposing the still human shaped labia within.

Janice and Jaclyn pulled Julie's fins until Brian's cock probed her vent, and then waited for Julie's tail to wrap around his. Once she entwined her tail around Brian's, then both other girls wrapped their tails around the two of them. Jaclyn watched Janice's eyes widen as they both found the right position that placed their vents at the ends of Brian's pelvic fins, which were already vibrating.

Jaclyn watched as both Julie and Brian leveraged their tails to start stroking Brian's cock in and out of her body. Her own body was flushed with desire, and she concentrated on the building tension in her body that signified her first mer-orgasm. She marveled at how the end of Brian's fin stayed firmly lodged in her vent, pressed against her clit, no matter how far his hips moved back and forth. As the tension build within her body, Jaclyn felt her breasts grow heavy, and she realized that soon she would produce mermaid milk for the first time. She watched Janice's eyes slowly close with passion as they both raced towards their first mer-orgasms. She grabbed Brian's dorsal fin to pull herself more firmly onto his pelvic fin, forcing the tip of his vibrating appendage deeper into her body.

Her efforts were immediately rewarded as her now heavy breasts began to leak milk into the water. She saw through lidded eyes, Julie's breasts spraying milk, shaking with each powerful thrust of Brian's hips. Jaclyn looked down at herself, her enormous new breasts, her flat, thin waist, her wide, generous hips with Brian's fin pressed firmly into her vent, and she gave herself over to her orgasm. Without any conscious control of her own, her hips moved in the very same rocking, vibrating motion they had when she was still a human. She felt like a passenger in her own body as her orgasm took over, her body shaking with even greater pleasure than ever before, her new mer-womb filling her abdomen with powerful throbs of clenching, quivering pleasure. Jaclyn realized that she was screaming, then she realized she wasn't the only one. A rich, milky cloud covered their pod as all four mers thrashed out their first mer-orgasms together.

To be continued?
