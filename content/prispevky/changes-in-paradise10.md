Trevor and Rose finish their changes, Pat makes new discoveries about mermaid bodies, new potential mers arrive on Mermaid Island. The saga continues

<!--more-->

Pat floated on her back in the open sea just outside the mer's entrance to their "home" in the western caves. The moon was a mere sliver of light, nearly lost among the vast swath of stars that flowed across the dark expanse of the sky. What a lonely little moon, Pat thought to herself as the small waves pushed her body back and forth. I know just how you feel. You were once of this earth, she thought, and now you are slowly slipping away. Like the moon, she felt that her sense of the world was slipping further and further away, even as she was sure that the world would soon be knocking on their door.

She sighed, filled with a growing sense of foreboding, a fear that sharpened as she felt her daughter stir in her womb. She and John agreed on "Maureen" for their impending daughter's name, which honored Pat's own Celtic heritage and meant, "born of the sea" in Gaelic. Her entire pod decided on names in the wake of Liga's premature delivery. Naming did not lessen her unease, and tonight, waves of fear washed over her. Was the sharp sliver of pain in her chest more than fear of the future; was it fear of childbirth, she wondered? Maybe she was simply grieving the loss of her own family--she had two siblings, after all. Would she ever see her brother and sister again?

Pat watched the sky as the waves pushed her back and forth, feeling her hair caress her shoulders, back, and sides as her breasts rocked up and down. She could sense a shark wending its way towards her, but she knew that it would pass her by. The sea was full of activity, even in the dark of night, and Pat reached out as far as she could with her mer-senses. There was nothing large in the water anywhere nearby. She was alone, for the moment, and she felt alone, as a mermaid. It had been so strange, wonderful but strange, all these changes. A little over two years ago, she had been a man. Now, she was a mermaid.

She imagined her older brother, Cory, meeting her for the first time. He was very religious, and he had disapproved of Patrick's wandering, scientific, environmental-activist lifestyle. The last time they spoke, nearly five years ago, he argued that evolution was bunk, and that everything was pre-ordained by God. All Patrick had to do, Cory urged, was to "let go and let God." Right. Pat almost smiled to herself, thinking of what her brother would say if he, like Liga, was forcibly changed into a mermaid. How would he fit that change into his worldview? Would that make her invention of the goop an act of God? Maybe, she thought. Maybe.

She looked out into the deep darkness of the sky, wondering how many other civilizations there were out there among the countless stars and galaxies. Were there mermaids out there too? Could they help protect their fledgling community of mers? Cory was like many people Pat remembered, always puzzled as to why someone should spend their life trying to save people and the planet rather than save the people's souls. They had fought countless times after Pat had gone to college, and (his) older brother disapproved of Pat's views on life, religion, the universe and everything. There was only one bright light, she thought to herself; her parents were already dead. The thought of introducing herself to them was worse than anything Cory could do.

Her sister, Bridget, was a different story. She was the eldest, Patrick was the youngest, and was the only girl: but not any more, Pat thought ruefully. Bridget mothered both of her younger brothers, but Patrick had always felt especially close to her. Now she taught high school English in a rural school in Oregon and was something of a free spirit. Bridget had been married once, but now Pat suspected that she was either in a Boston marriage or an outright lesbian. Pat smiled as she imagined her sister's face when she heard the news from Mermaid Island. Bridget would be totally cool with her new sister. Hopefully, Hank and Janice would be able to find her.

As for the rest of humanity, Pat thought, well, they were going to be in for a big surprise. She was hopeful that enough people would be accepting, and perhaps some like Sally and Eric who would eagerly seek to join their community. But she knew her brother, and he would react with fear and loathing. She cataloged all the conversations that she had had with the other mers about their families, pasts, and suspicions about the "real world." Galina and Alexis in particular were adamant that the Russian military would stop at nothing to exploit the siren cell. None of the mers completely trusted their previous governments, and Gabriel was more worried about religious extremism than secular government reaction.

Pat's fears throbbed in her chest. How could they re-enter the world without becoming pawns to some military group, or the scientific community, or simply becoming sideshow freaks? There were far too few mermaids to insure that someone or some country that wanted to use mermaid milk or mermaids themselves for nefarious purposes would leave them alone at best, or kidnap some or all of them at worst. She felt completely vulnerable, especially with her daughter growing within her body. Her heart pounded as she thought of Maureen trapped in a secret tank in the Nevada dessert, probes attached to her body as faceless scientists drew fluids from her small form.

She pushed that thought from her mind, and focused again on the stars and the small sliver of the moon. She felt Maureen stirring in her womb again; her baby had both doubled in size in the last month and become more active. Maureen's flukes pushed gently against the sides of her womb as the little mermaid rolled over, her tail pressing on Pat's cervix. Would she go into early labor like Liga? She ran her hands over her now swollen belly, up along her not quite trim waist to her breasts that were pointing into the night air as she lay horizontally along the surface of the waves. Soon her breasts would be giving nourishment to her daughter, and she briefly wondered which of the two boys, Trevor or Robbie, would come to know the special joy she felt as she tweaked her nipples in the starlight.

She flicked her flukes out of the water, spraying her torso and face with water, and she rubbed the weariness from her eyes. The cool, salt water felt good, as she stared into the night sky. She raised her head, looking down at her body, watching it float effortlessly along the surface. How did she do that, she suddenly wondered, the scientist in her awakening. Normally, when mermaids were completely relaxed or sleeping, their natural buoyancy was a few meters below the surface of the water. Yet, now she was easily staying on the surface of the water with no movements of her fins or flukes.

Well, if it works with conception, Pat thought to herself, the links between what a mermaid's mind was thinking and how her body responded was worth exploring. She focused her mind on not floating. After a few seconds of mental effort, she started sinking. She continued her focus on relaxing and continued to drift down. She noted that she was in the normal mer vertical position about three meters below the surface. She focused on becoming heavier, on sinking, and after a few seconds, she started to sink again, gaining speed as she concentrated. For several minutes, she descended into the dark water, gaining speed as she kept concentrating. She could feel the water pressure growing, pressing in on her, but not nearly as much as she thought it would. After five more minutes of concentration, she could feel the water rushing past her as she sank like a rock. She remembered back to the thrill of salvaging the Russian submarine, descending into that dark world hundreds of meters below the surface.

As her mer-vision adapted to the near blackness of the sea around her, she looked up along the sheer underwater cliff that ran down from the western side of Mermaid Island and estimated that she was at least two hundred meters down, but the pressure against her body didn't feel much more than two atmospheres (about 29 psi), or the equivalent of 10 meters under water. The mers had simply taken it for granted that they could survive in deep water, but now she was engaged by the puzzle. She concentrated on stopping, staying at this depth, and very quickly, she stopped moving. How was she doing this? She reached out with her mer-senses, focusing on her own body. She was comfortable, but there was a slight tightness along her tail, spine, and dorsal ridge.

She looked down at her tail, and noticed that it was flickering very faintly in a pattern that started in her dorsal ridge and radiated down and around her tail in regular waves. Her elbow fins were also flickering with the faintest lines of energy. These were not the same patterns of light emitted during sex, she noted. Their sexual luminescence was wildly random, flicking across their tails like a summer storm, bright, intense, and chaotic. These faint flickering patterns were regular and uniformly shaped. She reached out into the black sea with her hands, and felt a slight increase in pressure press against her hands and wrists. The water felt colder further away from her torso. She drew back her hand, and then repeated the experiment to each side. She found the same result, about eighteen inches (45 cm) out from her body, the pressure of the sea was slightly more, but within that circle, the pressure appeared to be a little more than about two atmospheres.

She remembered some of the mers complaining that their hands were sore as they salvaged the Russian submarine, but now she suspected that it was not soreness from over work but rather from the intense chill and pressure. She focused on floating, and tried to pay attention to what her body was doing. She felt a slight surge of tingling along her spine and dorsal ridge, most of the tingling originating in her dorsal ridge between her hips and knees. She twisted around and could see that her fringe along her entire dorsal ridge was stiff and straight, rising up from her back like the teeth of a rake, which explained the tension she felt along the entire length of her dorsal fringe, from her shoulder blades to her flukes. The tingling seemed to originate in her upper tail. That was the location of the mer's third or lower electrical organ. Perhaps their third organ created an electromagnetic field of some kind, one that shielded them from the intense pressures.

If it was an electromagnetic field, it did not appear to extend much beyond her body. Her body was now rising, and she relaxed her focus on floating and returned to the puzzle. The electromagnetic field did not circle outward from her core, like similar fields generated by planets or magnets. It appeared to be bound up inside her body, limited to the surface of her skin. Perhaps the nano-structured skin and scales that made their bodies hydrophobic also focused and transmitted whatever force their lower organ was producing.

Going back in her mind, she remembered the autopsies. The dark, gray fibers that left the lower organ on Agba and Angara followed the same body channels as their nerves from their spinal chord, but those fibers, unlike the ones from both the middle and upper electronic organs, did not intersect with their neural network. Those gray filaments had mirrored their nerves throughout their body, but did not meet. The top organ was attached directly to the spinal cord, and the middle organ made several connections between the top organ and bottom one, but other than that, the top and bottom systems did not intersect.

Without an electron microscope Pat could not begin to map how their electromagnetic organs, nerves, and skin structures might be working together, and she suspected that the nano-structures that made their skin both strong and soft contributed to the process. Perhaps it was like superconductivity, she mused. The right materials in the right alignment allowed a normally weak force to be stronger.

As she neared the surface, her ears popped, reminding her of playing in a pool as a youngster. She saw that her tail was no longer luminescent, and could feel that her dorsal ridge was now relaxed. She also sensed someone approaching from the entrance to their caves, three someone's, in fact, three very special someone's. John, Danni, and Phoebe emerged from the underwater tunnel and made their way towards Pat. For a brief instant, a small part of her resented the intrusion into her solitary reflection, but that part was banished as the warmth and love from her pod washed over her.

"Can't sleep?" asked John, as he rose upwards with her.

"No," she answered, as her head broke the surface into the night air, followed by her tail rising to the surface of the water.

"Maureen?" asked Danni, as she allowed her tail to rise, floating horizontally next to Pat.

"No," Pat answered, rubbing her swollen tummy. "She's quiet tonight."

"Well Freya is kicking up a storm," Danni complained, running her hands across her slowly undulating belly.

"What were you doing?" asked Phoebe. "We could sense you for a while, but then you disappeared from our mer-senses. That's why we came out looking for you."

"Experimenting," Pat answered grinning. "I think I may have discovered how we survive depths and such, but we can work on it later and try to confirm my suspicions. How's Cynthia doing?"

"She's quiet," Phoebe answered. "What brought you out here, before you started experimenting?"

"And woke us up?" added John.

"That is one disadvantage to mermaid bonding," Danni said. "Your headache is everyone's headache."

"Oh, I was just worried about everyone that is headed our way," Pat answered with a sigh as all three of her pod-mates surrounded her. "We have Bill and Mae, Sally's Dad, Alberto's boss, and who knows else all ready to pounce on our little slice of paradise."

"And Hank and Janice," Danni added.

"What about Hank and Janice?" asked Phoebe. "I thought they were on our side?"

"They are, but Robbie is either going to be a merman or a mermaid, and either way, we're going to have to explain why we allowed that to happen," Danni explained.

"I'm not worried about Hank and Janice," John said dismissively. "I talked about that possibility before they left. Janice even predicted Robbie would become a mermaid."

"Oh, well. Good. Because I'll bet that Trevor won the wrestling match," Danni said.

"No way. The match was Robbie's idea, and you saw how much weight he put on in the last three weeks. You're on," Phoebe said. "What's the wager?"

"Five un-requited orgasms," Danni said with a smile.

"You're a horny little mermaid," Phoebe said.

"Well, is it a bet?" Danni asked.

"It's a bet," she agreed.

"Um ... it is midnight, and we all need rest," John reminded everyone. "Can we go back to sleep?"

"I'm sorry John," Pat sighed. "What am I going to say to Bill and Mae? Even better, what am I going to say to my family when we finally contact them again?"

"Bill and Mae are easy, don't worry about them," John reassured her. "Cory hasn't come looking for you, has he?"

Pat shook her head.

"We have no idea how successful Hank will be in convincing them to visit, especially since he can't tell them the truth." John said. "I know you're worried, but you do have a family, one that loves you very much."

"Oh, John," Pat said. "I didn't mean that you and—"

"We know you didn't mean anything like that," John gently cut her off. "And we can only do what we can do. First, let's worry about Malaki, Sally's father, and the rest of the world. Then we can worry about our family members."

"I guess you're right," Pat agreed. "But I still worry."

"We will work it out," Danni reassured her. "Something big is going to break through for us, I can tell."

"How?" Phoebe asked skeptically.

"Women's intuition," Danni answered, caressing Phoebe's breasts.

"Oh, and what is your woman's intuition telling you now?" Phoebe asked as her breasts reacted to Danni's touch.

"That the lively little mermaids in our bellies would calm down if we attended to some quality bonding time," Danni said, letting her tail sink and wrapping it around Phoebe's.

"I really like your thinking. Let's go back to the cave," Phoebe said, her breathing rising as Danni caressed her body.

"Not before I take some of your action," Pat said.

"You want some of this ... ooohhh ... action?" Phoebe asked, as Danni pinched her nipple.

"Five unrequited orgasms says Trevor won," Pat said, wrapping her own tail around her sister-wives', pressing her belly to their equally swollen bellies.

"Oh, you want a piece of that action?" Phoebe challenged, struggling to maintain her composure as her sister wives caressed her breasts, belly, and tail. "Fine. Double it."

"What?" Pat said. "You want to give us each ten if we win and us give you ten if you win?"

"Yep," Phoebe said.

"You're on, chump!" Danni said giggling.

"John, do you want some of this action?" Pat asked.

"The only action I want is back in the Moon Pool, with each of you pressed against MY body," John said, cocking an eyebrow at his mermaids. "Last one back is on my fins for the first two rounds," he said as he turned for the caves.

All three mermaids giggled and squealed in delight, turning into the water and giving chase to the merman who retreated before them. Pat was last, but she didn't mind. Maureen decided that it was a good time to test out her tail in the womb. But Danni was right, after a few quality orgasms, everyone, including the mermaids in their wombs, settled back down to sleep.

Rose blinked in the early morning light, her hair falling across her face as she eased into wakefulness. Her eyelids languidly opened and closed, while she remembered the previous evening. She and Trevor had made love countless times; their last coupling was in the hot tub in the starlight. She smiled at the memory, but something was pressing into her thigh, a warm stiffness that poked into her soft, round leg. She carefully eased herself away from Trevor's morning hard on, rolling onto her back. She could feel her breasts shift as she settled herself back into the bed.

She glanced over at Trevor, who was still sound asleep, his breathing even, his lips parted, and his blond hair pushed up into a faux-hawk. She smiled at his hair, his bed-mussed-head, and reached across her body to smooth it down, feeling the mass of her own breast getting in her way. She stopped reaching, and looked down at the cleavage she had created, a cleavage that she had never before possessed. Her breasts; she never thought that she would ever have to think about such a thing. Why was she so accepting of her change? Was that normal? She would have to talk to the other mermaids who were formerly men about their experiences.

She relaxed her arm and watched as her new breasts returned to their previous positions, her nipples pointing into the cool morning air. God, what would her parents think of her now, she wondered. Who were her parents recruiting to be her (Robbie's) pod-mates? What would happen when they got here and discovered that Robbie was no longer qualified to be a pod-leader. Who would not become Trevor's pod-mates now that Rose had become one? What would her sisters think? Would they become her new pod mates with Trevor? Shouldn't she be more worried about her sex change? Should her body feel this wonderful? She blinked as the questions rushed through her still sleepy mind. But she was not worried, she answered herself, and her new body did feel wonderful, she grinned remembering last night's orgasms.

There was one question, however, that would not be dismissed, one that she now focused on with eager anticipation. What kind of mermaid would she become? Her breathing quickened as she mused on her impending change. Mermaid ... mermaid ... wait, there was something tickling her along her back. She eased herself up from the bed and went over to the mirror, twisting to look at her back. She pulled her long and thick hair over the front of her shoulder and looked at her long and shapely back.

Two long strands of red skin stretched from above her shoulder blades down to the small of her back on either side of her spine. The strips narrowed until they were a point about an inch above the two dimples that marked the top of her ass. Her gills were appearing, and they should be ready after one more feeding later in the morning. She swayed her hips, watching her body move back and forth move in the mirror. She loved the feeling of weight along her hips, rather than along her torso when she was a guy. She could feel her new body parts move--her breasts and her hips--and she loved the way her waist felt so insubstantial, so thin.

She turned in profile again, admiring the curves and slopes her body possessed. There was still enough of Robbie left inside that she was in lust with her own body. Her breasts hung like two large teardrops from her chest, their soft contours bulging away from her ribs. Her new nipples crinkled tightly as she watched her arousal grow, rising from the pink areolas at the center of each breast. She ran her hands down her torso, feeling her waist narrow down before flaring out to her hips. Her fingers traced the line of muscle that arched down from the top of each hip, flowing forward around her belly, tapering to a vee above her pubic hair. Beneath the soft tuft of hair, she could see her vagina swelling, opening, becoming wet. She imagined her legs growing into a tail, a bright red tail.

She turned and looked at Trevor, still sleeping, and felt her cunt twitch in anticipation. She walked around the other side of the bed and examined Trevor's back. There were two strands of red skin on his back too.

She reached out with her fingers and stroked the red patches very lightly. Trevor moaned in his sleep, shifting away from her touch. She giggled softly and eased her body down onto the bed behind him, pressing her body along his, feeling her nipples press into his nascent gills, her belly pressing into the small of his back. She reached around the still sleeping man and carefully grabbed his stiff cock. She remembered back to the last time she masturbated as a man, only two days ago, and she smiled at the memory. She had no regrets, and she could still play with a cock anytime she wanted to, she thought as she slowly stroked Trevor's stiff penis.

"Now that is what I call an alarm clock," he said huskily.

"Today's weather calls for a one hundred percent chance of fucking," Rose said softly into his ear. "With strong orgasms coming down from the north. The five day forecast calls for increased fucking as mer tails develop within the western caves."

"What are the latest developments in business news?" he asked.

"Stock prices are rising," she said as she grabbed the base of his penis and gave it a good squeeze. "And the market looks forward to sustained growth in key areas."

"Entertainment?" he asked.

"A rising star of beach and lagoon was spotted last night at Club Hot Tub," she giggled. "Where a handsome young stud gave her a thorough going over on the dance floor. Spectators were left breathless with the skill the two dancers exhibited."

"And sports?" he asked.

"In baseball news today," she said. "Rookie Trevor Green hit five home runs last night with no errors. Rumor has it that he will repeat this extraordinary feat in a day game this morning."

"Rookie?" he challenged.

"Weren't you a virgin?" she teased. "You mean, I'm not gasp your first?"

"No, and no one plays baseball in the morning," he said as he felt her rubbing her breasts across his back, which felt more sensitive than it had previously.

"That's fine," she said, licking and kissing his neck. "Because I don't want to play baseball."

"What do you want to play?" he asked, feeling her stroking increase in speed and strength.

"I think you can figure it out, if you're smart enough," she said, kissing and nipping his shoulders and neck.

"Tiddlywinks?" he asked.

"Nope," she giggled, swirling the drops of precum around his crown with her index finger, watching his hips twitch as she pushed and pulled on his cock. "Maybe you really were a virgin?"

"Backgammon?" he asked, squirming at her increasingly frantic touch.

"Guess again," she said, biting down on his shoulder hard enough to make a mark.

"Hide the sausage?" He squawked as he felt her teeth nearly break skin.

"Close," she giggled, kissing him where she had marked him.

"Pluck a Rose?" he asked.

"Fuck the Rose," she demanded, pulling him onto his back by his cock.

"How about the Rose fucks me?" he asked as he looked up at her body, her breasts pressing into his stomach.

"Tempting, but I have something else in mind," she said.

"And what would that be?" he asked smiling.

"We are about to lose our legs," she said. "And I want to lose them; I can't wait to become a mermaid. So, I want to make love standing up, with you behind me, because that position will never again be available to us."

"Deal," he said rising, his cock bouncing. "Where?"

"Over here," she said, rising and crossing to the window of the hut, overlooking the lagoon far below.

She took his hand as he crossed to her, and placed it on her breast, feeling her nipple stiffen further under his hand. She reached up with her other hand and guided his face towards hers.

"I'm so happy we didn't wait," she said as she kissed him.

Trevor felt her generous lips envelop his, her tongue seeking his, and her body pressing up into his. He cupped her ass with one hand and ran the other over the small of her back, feeling her tiny waist and the rough patches of her newly formed gills. She moaned into the kiss, and reached down to stroke his cock. Trevor reached around her hips and felt her crotch and found it dripping.

"God, you're so hot," he said, pushing two fingers into her, feeling her abdomen tense.

Rose shuddered as his insistent fingers wiggled into her new vagina, his other hand resting on her heaving chest, her nipple pressed into his palm. Her eyes were lidded with passion, and she jerked on his cock, barely able to control her limbs. They continued to stimulate one another, watching each other's faces as their passion built.

"I want you," she said, twisting around, forcing his fingers from her, and resting her arms on the sill of the window. "Now."

She lowered her shoulders and pushed her hips up, rising on her tiptoes, thrusting her butt towards him. Her breasts dangled heavily from her ribs, brushing the windowsill as she gyrated her hips. Her hair cascaded over her shoulders, flowing like a river of ink over her pale white skin. She spread her feet slightly, feeling her sex open like a wet flower, her juices running down her legs.

"Take me," she said, panting with need.

Trevor grabbed his stiff cock and aimed it at her pink lips, and slowly pushed it into her. She moaned as each inch stretched her open, her flesh rippling around the pole as it snaked its way into her, her hips swaying back and forth as together they worked his stiff pole into her body. When he bottomed out, he grabbed her hips and steadied them, moving his own hips instead, feeling his cock slide wetly within her.

"You're so wet," he said.

"Ummmmm, you have no idea," she said. "I can't tell you how good it feels."

"Try," he said.

"Ohhhhhh, why?" she moaned. "Are you thinking of ... ummmmm ... becoming a mermaid too?"

"No," he said, pulling out slightly and then pushing back in. "I want to know what you're feeling."

"Oh, god," she gasped, feeling his strong cock move through her body. "Every part of me is on fire, burning—uugh, that feels good," she said as he bottomed out again. "I can feel your cock in me, stretching me, filling me," she whimpered, barely getting the words out of her mouth. "I love the way you grab my hips, pulling me onto your cock. I love the way my breasts sway with each stroke, and my nipples feel like little erections."

"Keep talking," he said, increasing his speed.

"Oh ... my ... insides ... are ... squeezing ... your ... big ... cock," she grunted with each stroke. "My ... legs ... are ... turning ... in ... to ... jelly."

Trevor could see her start to lose control, and he took her body weight into his arms, lifting her toes off the floor.

"Oh ... god ... oh ... god ... oh," she moaned.

He watched her slender back and shoulders as each stroke rippled up her back. Her ass shook, and then her spine took the force of each impact, and her breasts swung in circles below her chest, bulging outward as they swung madly with the force of his strokes. Her shoulders punched forward with each thrust he made. His stiff cock now supported her body weight, her feet were no longer touching the ground.

"Talk ... to ... me," he ordered, slamming into her.

"Umm ... can't ... mmmmm... ooh ...
cuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmiiiiiiiiiiiiggggggg," she gasped and bucked back against his strokes, pushing herself with her arms into him.

"Yes, do it!" he said, pumping his hips back and forth as fast as he could. He could feel her Kegel muscles pulse against him, pulling and pushing at his cock. Her legs were kicking, shaking; her body was out of control, completely in the grips of her orgasm. She was now screaming in passion continuously, for at least a minute, and then her body slowly returned to her conscious control.

"What's ... it ... like?" he asked, slowing his strokes as her thighs stopped shaking.

"Ummm ... uh ... I can't ... uh ... explain," she gasped, trying to calm herself.

"Try," he urged, slowing his strokes and setting her toes back down on the ground. "Stand up."

Rose stood on her shaking legs, feeling Trevor's long cock still buried inside her, the tip of his cock now pressing firmly into the knot of nerves that was her G-spot. Her entire body seemed to be vibrating. She could feel the muscles in her legs quivering, making it difficult to stand.

"Tell me," he whispered into her ear as she leaned back into him.

"Oh, god, it feels so good," she said, rocking her hips back into him. "I feel you inside me, and my whole belly feels full of you. My skin tingles all over, and I can't stop my legs from shaking. Oh, right there, keep going, right there," she moaned as Trevor angled his hips down, and started stroking more quickly.

"A pressure is building ... uh ... in my abdomen," she said.

"Where?"

"Don't know ... oh ... higher up than when I was a guy," she continued, moaning and cooing as she talked. "Right behind your cock, ah ... near the top of your cock."

"What about your breasts?"

"Oh, they feel heavy," she said, bringing one hand up to her breasts, caressing them. "And hot, and tingly ... faster, go faster ... uh ... uh ... yes, that's it ... I'm getting close ... my nipples ache ... so good ... harder ... ahhh ... oh, come with me," she pleaded, pressing her hips down into each stroke.

"Talk," he said urgently.

"The ... pressure ... is ... building ... tightening ... it's ... coming," she was now pushing back with nearly the same force as Trevor was using to thrust forward, their bodies were slapping against one another's.

"Colors ... in ... my ... eyes ... ah ... ah ... pressure ... building ... so ... good ... it's ... it's coming ... waves pushing ... I'm going to ... going to ...," her mouth formed the shape of the word "come," but no sound emerged. Her body was frozen, and Trevor held himself deep within her, unmoving. He could feel the pressure around his cock build, slowly squeezing down, further and further, until suddenly, Rose screamed, her body shaking all over, her legs collapsed as they began twitching uncontrollably, and Trevor took her entire body weight into his hands.

"Yes, yes," he hissed as he resumed pounding into her, feeling her juices flow over his thighs as she thrashed and moaned, her legs dangling from her hips as he held her. He slammed into her a final time, finding his own earth shattering release, gripping her waist, pulling back on her hips as he spurted into her, like a male spider about to become her breakfast, unknowing, uncaring, and unbelievably overwhelmed by pleasure.

Rose rode the waves of pleasure, her eyes clenched shut, her legs dangling from Trevor's pulsing cock, feeling wave after wave rolling through her body, unconscious of anything other than the burning sensation she felt deep within her womb, a wet hotness that tingled and throbbed. Slowly, she stopped shaking, and she rested her forehead on the windowsill, smelling the fresh morning sent of the jungle and the musky smell of their sex. She could feel Trevor's slowly deflating cock still within her, and she gave it a good squeeze, forcing it slowly from her now satisfied vagina.

"The next time we make love, we will be mers," she sighed.

"I still don't see how it can get any better," he said, still feeling the after shocks of his own orgasm.

"There's only one way find out," she said, wobbling on shaky legs towards the door. "Race you down to the beach?"

Trevor watched as Rose dove into the pool, the bright mid-morning sun illuminating the Moon Pool, her wake sending diamond flashes of sunlight dancing around the cave. She made a smooth line of bubbles into the center of the pool and came to rest a few meters below the surface. The walls of the pool glowed with a pale luminescence visible even in the sunlight, and the result was a crystal clear view of the pool all the way to the bottom ten meters below. She was surrounded by over a dozen mers of all shapes and colors, each of them positioned around the edge of the pool in perfect symmetry.

"She'll be fine," Petra reassured the pacing boy. "It will be done in less than thirty minutes. Stop pacing, you're making Michelle nervous," she warned as Michelle's tail beat against her mother's hip as she fed from her breast.

"But you two aren't helping," Trevor worried. "Won't that make it longer?"

"No," Liga answered, holding Mari to her breast as the littlest and newest mermaid wiggled in her grasp. "There are five pregnant mermaids down there. Our milk is stronger after pregnancy."

"And the Moon Pool is starting to be a force on its own," Petra explained. "Pat and Phoebe discovered that there are microscopic organisms that have adapted to our presence and amplify the effects of the siren cell."

"What do you mean by adapted and amplify?" Trevor asked worriedly.

"We are still not sure on the mechanics of how the siren cell works," Petra admitted. "But we have been releasing a lot of mermaid milk into this pool on a regular basis for a long time."

"As you will discover when you change," Liga smiled.

"Yes," Trevor agreed. "I've been told to expect the intensity of the need for sex after our transition. But what about these microscopic organisms? What are they doing to her?"

"Nothing that the mermaid milk doesn't already do," Petra reassured him. "Phoebe discovered that the pool itself has become a catalyst, and that the change will now happen in minutes, even if there are only a few mermaids present. In fact, it is possible that in the future, anyone who wanders into the cave may find themselves affected by the siren cell even if no mermaids are here."

"Wouldn't that qualify the pool as a toxic site?" Trevor asked, only half joking.

"That would depend on whether or not you considered the effects a bad thing or not," Liga speculated.

Trevor watched as Rose moved to the next mer around the circle. He could see her grasp the very long cock of a merman with a black tail with silver highlights and bring it to her mouth. He felt a twinge of jealousy, and stifled a desire to jump into the pool.

"Is that John?" he asked pointing.

"No, it's Gabriel," Petra answered. "He's my mate, and don't worry, he is not going to steal your Rose from you."

"I didn't say—" he protested.

"No, you didn't say," Liga interrupted. "But your body did."

"How can you tell?" Trevor asked.

"Mer-senses," Petra answered. "Don't you remember anything from Emma's lesson this morning?"

"I don't remember mer-senses," Trevor admitted. "I was so excited about the change. She focused mostly on anatomy. What are mersenses ?"

"Well, she may not have covered them since we are still learning about them. We can sense one another's electrical discharges, and those discharges are linked to mood, health, and identity," Petra said. "It's the only way we can tell the triplets apart."

"Oh," he said. "But you can do that even now, out of the water?" he asked.

"Yes, for shorter distances in the air than in the water, but it's easier when the subject is broadcasting his mood so loudly and clearly," Petra teased.

Trevor scowled and turned his attention back to the water, where Rose had moved onto the next mermaid, a small girl with a dark green tail and black hair. He could sense a power in the water, and he could hear a low tone, almost like humming, rise from the pool. Two mermaids swam below Rose and began stroking her legs. She then moved onto the next mermaid, a tall mermaid with a richly colored maroon tail with blue highlights and red hair.

"Who will be her last?" Trevor asked.

"Phoebe," Petra answered.

"Why Phoebe?" Trevor asked.

"You are a curious one now," Petra teased, shifting the now calmer Michelle to her other breast. "Because Phoebe was the first mermaid."

"And that makes her special how?" he asked.

"Trevor!" Petra said exasperated, "Rose will be your last, and that is all you really need to worry about, isn't it? Now, relax. She'll be fine, you'll be next, and we can worry about Hank and Janice when they come back. You really are a bundle of nerves today."

"Sorry," he blurted. "I can't seem to help myself."

They all watched in silence, listening to the low hum rising from the pool, and the cooing of Michelle and Mari. Rose moved from mer to mer, and the pool began to shimmer with power. Trever began pacing again.

"I am beginning to think that Robbie threw the wrestling match on purpose," Liga mused.

"Why do you say that?" Trevor snapped.

"Because you are obviously NOT the stronger one," she said with a soft smile to show she was teasing.

Trevor blushed and stopped pacing. He turned back to the pool. Rose was now sucking on the breasts of a mermaid with a sea-blue tail and nearly white blond hair. Both Rose and the mermaid looked like they were having an orgasm. Rose's black hair seemed longer, her legs even looked longer, and they were pointed stiffly towards the bottom of the pool. The two mermaids who had been stroking her legs rose to their original position around the edge of the ring. Rose broke away from Phoebe, her body rigid. She floated to the middle of the pool, her arms outstretched, and her legs pointed straight down.

The power in the cave intensified, and the two baby mermaids began to hum as they sucked on their mother's breasts. Trevor could feel the hair on the back of his neck rise, but he wasn't frightened so much as swept up in the rising energy. For several minutes, Rose hung in the water, unmoving, a soft glow emanating from her suspended body. Then she convulsed, her body undulating in the water, and Trevor could see that her legs had merged. After another few minutes, she began to slowly twirl in the center of the pool, moved by an unseen force, while more convulsions rolled through her body. Her hair was now down to her hips, and small fins had started to sprout from her hips and knees.

He remembered Emma's description of what happened during the change as he watched from the edge of the pool. She explained that the bones in Rose's legs were broken down into multiple joints that still attached to her pelvis. Her entire pelvic saddle was changing, and the interior was widening to accommodate her new mer-womb. The bone shaved from the inside of her pelvis would be redistributed as her pubic bone angled forward and broadened, becoming shaped more like her ilium, while the coxal bones shifted to her center of gravity, which made each femur lodge in a newly positioned ball joint that allowed mers to flex their tails 160-degrees forwards and backwards. A new, smaller joint grew in her pubic bone, higher and more forward along the pelvic saddle from where the femurs were originally attached. From those new sockets, her new pelvic fins pushed outward as he watched, growing from small bumps to strong, flesh-colored fins about 30 cm long.

Below her pelvic fins, each femur was broken into three separate bones, each new joint surrounded by new tendons so that their upper could flex about thirty degrees in any direction. At the base of both femurs, a new bridge joint, like a smaller pelvic saddle, anchored each femur together where her knees had been. This new joint could also flex nearly 150-degrees backwards and forwards, and the mid-tail fins grew from each side this new bridge. Even now, he could see these smaller fins reach their full length, about half as long as her pelvic fins.

From her knees to her ankles, each tibia was reformed into two columns of six bones, all joints surrounded by tendons that allowed the bottom half of her tail to flex and twist 160-degrees in any direction. Emma explained that the now missing fibulas were probably used to create new bones in their fins and the bridge joints at their knees and ankles. The two multi-jointed tibias in her lower tail were attached to a new bridge joint where her ankles used to be that allowed her flukes to rotate 90-degrees in each direction like a pinwheel. From that joint, her metatarsals and phalanges stretched out into the long, bony ridges that supported and shaped each side of her nearly meter wide flukes. The flukes could flap up and down from her newly reformed tarsals (ankles), and each side of her flukes (each former foot) could move independently of the other.

Trevor could see that her tail was now completely formed, and he watched her body shimmer in the water as a bright red color began to spread upwards from her flukes, slowly covering the entire length of her new tail. Her elbow fins, which he hadn't noticed before, also blossomed in the same red color. The trailing edges of all her fins and flukes sprouted a deep, black velvet fringe, and another black stripe of velvet rose up her dorsal ridge, reaching to the middle of her shoulder blades. A few more moments passed, and then her body shook in a final tremor, her body arching backwards upon itself, her flukes fluttering above her head. Suddenly, Rose relaxed in the water, and there was a palpable release of pressure in the cave while the light in the pool dimmed. She gave herself a push with her new tail, and rose to the surface.

Trevor stood slack jawed as he watched Rose's face emerge from the water. Her violet eyes sparkled with a jewel-like intensity, and her knowing smile seemed to burn with new knowledge and power. Her perfect white teeth were even except for the two incisors that were now sharp and pointed. Her round, full breasts bobbled in the water, her nipples slightly larger than they had been before. She looked at him like he was prey. They held each other's gaze for a few seconds.

"Well, what are you waiting for?" she asked in a silvery voice.

"Um, aren't you hungry?" Trevor asked, gulping. "Didn't Emma say that it took energy to do all this changing?"

"There's only one thing I want to eat," Rose said, growling. "Now get your ass into this pool."

"You'd better do as she says," Petra warned, stifling a laugh. "You don't want to piss off a mermaid."

Trevor looked nervously at Petra, Liga, and then back to Rose.

"Well?" Rose said, rising up on her tail out of the water, her arms resting on her hips as her tail flashed back and forth in the water, churning the surface of the pool into a white froth.

Trevor gasped at her display, awed by the power and sensuousness of her body and tail as it danced in the water. The water was cascading off her hydrophobic hair and skin, and her long dark hair swished around her shoulders and breasts as her tail flexed back and forth, keeping her torso well out of the water. Her breasts swung with each stroke of her tail, and the muscles in her tail and abdomen rippled and flexed hypnotically. Her bright red scales shimmered as her new strong muscles worked beneath the surface, and the velvety black fringes along the trailing edges of her elbow and pelvic fins danced in the air. The sound of churning water, like a waterfall, filled the cave. Mesmerized, Trevor blindly stepped towards the pool, missed his footing, and fell face first into the water. Rose pounced onto his flailing body and pulled him down into the center of the pool, kissing him. The other mermen all rose quickly from the water, giving room to their newest member.

"The men never learn until it's too late," Petra mused, stroking her daughter's hair as she suckled on her breast.

"No, they don't," Liga agreed as Eric slid up next to her and gave her a quick kiss.

"Men don't learn what?" he asked.

"That they are not in charge," Liga smiled, giving him a big kiss in return.

"There are compensating forces," MuSu said with amusement.

"What did he just say?" Petra asked.

"We may not be in charge," Gabriel laughed. "But having you for mates makes it worth the burden."

"What burden is that?" Petra asked with mock anger.

"The burden of being dispensable," MuSu said with mock sadness.

Trevor was caught in a trance; his entire body was rigid, as he drifted towards Rose. He knew that his body was changing forever, and that some of the light he could see reflected in her perfect violet eyes was coming from his body as the power of the mermaid milk built up within him. Below, he could feel Pat and Phoebe stroking his legs, legs he was about to lose permanently.

"Be my pod-mate forever and give me my tail?" he said, barely able to get the words out.

"Drink and receive your tail," Rose said as she gathered her soon-tobe -pod-mate into her arms, guiding his rigid body towards her straining nipple. As soon as he made contact, she erupted into an intense orgasm, one breast spurting milk into the water and the other into his mouth. He didn't notice Pat and Phoebe abandon his legs. He was only conscious of Rose and her breast as milk flowed from her into his mouth. They were locked in that embrace for several minutes before her spurting breasts subsided and Trevor drifted to the center of the pool.

He felt his arms rise in the water, stretching out to each side, feeling the power of the change sweep through his body. He could feel Rose's ferocious attention directed at his body, amplified by the other mermaids and the pool itself. Her gaze seemed to burn through him, searing him with its intensity, and the sound of the humming pressed on his body and on his mind like a heavy blanket. After a few moments, a great throbbing wave passed through his rigid body, and he felt the change begin. His bones were breaking, moving, changing, and reforming themselves into a merman's tail. Time seemed meaningless as wave after wave of convulsions swept through him, and he was barely aware of his body starting to spin. He felt muscles grow, twisting up from his tail, snaking up along his spine, anchoring themselves along his pelvis and backbone. His skin tingled as waves of pleasure throbbed outward from his newly repositioned groin, and he felt fins and flukes push out from his hips, knees, feet, and elbows. Finally, a great wave of release shook through him, causing his new red and black-stripped tail to quiver above his head. Gold fringes, he thought to himself as his body relaxed in the water. I have gold fringes on my flukes.

"Trevor," Rose called out to him, and he turned towards her. "Take me," she said simply, as she had the night before.

He pushed himself towards his new mate, and he barely noticed the other mermen and Petra and Liga dive back into the pool. He had eyes only for Rose who beckoned to him. He didn't notice Michelle and Mari snuggle along their mother's backs while their parents pressed their fronts together. He pulled on his vent and freed his now expanded cock into the water. He barely noticed that Rose entwined their tails together, and grabbed his cock, he was so entranced with her eyes. Her lips met his at the same time as she pressed herself home onto his cock, their eyes locked on one another's.

Trevor would never be able to tell anyone how long he and Rose remained locked together. He only remembered her eyes, and the long, throbbing orgasms that they both experienced, again and again. There was no need for recovery, as his new body responded to the desires Rose ignited, again and again. Long after the other mers had satisfied the passions created by the transformations and had left the Moon Pool, they remained hidden behind a cloud of white, while flashing red and gold lights illuminated the cloud from within. Hours later, after night had fallen and the mers had returned, both Trevor and Rose agreed that everyone was right; sex was better as a mer.

Three days later, Trevor and Rose finally agreed to separate themselves long enough so that MuSu could teach him the mer's version of underwater martial arts, and Pat and Phoebe could teach Rose about edible and safe marine flora and fauna.

Sandy Halbst looked over at his wife of ten years, watching the sea breezes toss her short blond hair. It was finally growing back after she had lost it during chemotherapy. Unfortunately, her ovarian cancer was returning too. Rather than spend the last weeks of her life in a hospital, they had jumped at the chance to help Hank and Janice Connors search for her in-law who had gone off on a Greenpeace mission. It would be one last beautiful trip together before the end.

"You're not supposed to be thinking what you're thinking," Dawn Halbst teased her husband, her green eyes dancing in the sunlight.

"Who said I was thinking anything?" he challenged. "I was just thinking how pretty your hair is in a pixie cut."

"Ha!" she laughed. "You and I both know that you preferred it long."

"So did you," he protested.

"Hug me," she said impulsively.

Sandy gathered his wife into his arms, and gently held her. They had first met in college, but it was not love at first sight. Sandy was short and thin for a guy; actually, he was a first class geek, whereas Dawn was a cheerleader, popular and stunningly beautiful. She was the classic five foot two, one hundred and two (lbs), and eyes of green, blond bombshell; and to the degree that cancer had weakened her body, she still was very attractive. He was only five foot six inches (167 cm), and a bespectacled geek. They had been "just friends," until Dawn had been dumped yet again by another jock-type boyfriend, and after a drunken evening of mutual solace, they had discovered themselves in bed together. Dawn discovered that she actually enjoyed Sandy's soft, slow, and tender style of lovemaking, and they had become a couple. Once Sandy got his "sex legs," Dawn discovered that Sandy's imagination and persistence lifted her to heights of love and pleasure she had never dreamed possible. After college, they were married.

Life had been kind to them, at first. Both worked in the computer industry, Sandy as a programmer and Dawn in marketing. After a few years, Hank Connors recruited Dawn to work for his new dot.com startup, and Sandy was just a trailing spouse that Hank hired reluctantly. After his first year, however, Sandy had three software patents and both the Halbsts and the Connors were reaping the benefits of his inventions. Now that material success was meaningless, Sandy was determined to make every minute with his wife count.

"I would do anything to—" he began.

"Shush," she said, hugging him tightly. "You've said it a thousand times."

"I'd like to say it a million more," he said, some sadness creeping into his voice.

"O.K., then," she said. "You'd better get started, because I don't have much time."

Sandy grimaced at her frankness, and wondered yet again how this woman got her strength.

"I love you," he said after a moment.

"I know," she said. "I love you too. Remember, you promised."

"I know," he said, emotion choking his voice. "But you made me."

"No moping after I'm gone," she said with determination.

"You're the only one that I want to—" he said.

"Hey! You promised," she insisted. "You will remarry. You're rich, young, and deserve to have someone love you."

"What about good looking?" he teased, trying to recover his emotional center.

"That's only been a recent development," she teased, happy to have distracted him from his sadness over her impending death. "You were a super geek until you turned thirty."

"Why did you ever marry me?" he asked, laughing now.

"Because I learned that love is on the inside, not the outside," she sighed, remembering.

"Hey you two," a voice said from the stern of the Sea Dancer, "get a room."

"Oh, Eve you're just jealous," Dawn said. "Besides, there is only one private room on this boat, and Bill and Mae are using it."

Eve Smith, Mae Williams' younger sister and Dawn's best friend from college, laughed as she watched her former roommate smile over her husband's shoulder. She was also a blond, blue-eyed cheerleader type, though much taller than Dawn, and she and Dawn had double dated many times. She was also glad that Dawn had found Sandy, someone who truly loved her for her spirit rather than her beauty. Such a true love had never happened for Eve, despite her fun and playful personality and cheerleader good looks.

"Sandy, you're supposed to be sailing this thing," Eve quipped as she rose from the galley, looking at the island off their starboard bow. "Bill and Mae are ... um ... "

"Indisposed, I know," Sandy said laughing. He released Dawn from his embrace and put his hands back on the wheel of the boat. "Tell them we should make landfall on 399 in an hour, maybe sooner if this wind holds up."

"I'll wait until they stop making soft groaning noises, as though we can't hear them," Eve said, her eyes laughing as she looked down into the galley.

"We heard all that!" a voice drifted up from below.

"Well then, finish up and get ready to rescue the out-law in-law," Dawn shouted down the hatch.

"Where are John and Patrick?" asked Dawn rhetorically. "There are beach huts here that someone keeps in good repair, but their boat is gone."

Bill scanned the beach, pushing his red hair back underneath the widebrimmed hat that he wore to protect his fair skin from the sun. He narrowed his eyes as he scanned the mountain before him, his barrel chest and stout legs spread out like two tree trunks. He looked like a mythic old sea captain, with several weeks of growth on his face, the dark red hair tight and curly. His wife leaned on his arm as he scanned the jungle. They had been on the island for over an hour, and they had found no sign of the two men.

"You don't think something happened to them since Trevor last radioed us?" Dawn worried.

"I don't see any signs of a struggle," Bill offered as he searched the jungle and nearby sand. "What do you think, Mae?"

Mae Williams gazed again at the sea, and then swept her eyes along the rising edge of the volcano, judging its size. She and Eve were nearly the same height, though there was a ten-year difference in their ages. Like her husband, she was sturdy where Eve was more willowy, and you could see the inner strength of the woman in her eyes.

"Maybe they are on the other side of the island," she offered. "We can get back in the boat and check. It would only take about three hours to sail around this small island."

"But that would be a waste of time," a voice said from the water.

All five humans who had been looking at the island rising up around them turned around to look at the water, and all of them gasped audibly. There were eighteen colorful mermaids and mermen arranged in a semi-circle in the shallow water just off the beach, their torsos rising above the small swells while their colorful tails splashed in the shallow water behind them. Two of the mermaids held smaller mermaids in their arms. Some appeared Asian, some Filipino, and some Caucasian. Mermaids outnumbered the mermen nearly three to one. They were all stunningly beautiful and handsome.

"We can generally do it in under fifteen minutes," said the merman who looked surprisingly like a younger version of John.

"Do what?" Bill asked, stunned at the sight before him.

"Swim around the island, silly," one of the three identical mermaids near John giggled.

"Bill, don't you recognize me?" John asked.

"Um ... not really," Bill said, trying to find his footing.

"Sandy, Dawn?" John continued.

"You look like the John I remember from ten years ago," Sandy began. "But he wasn't a mermaid."

"Merman, actually," John said smiling. "It's a good story. Would you like to hear about it?"

"Yes, I think so," Sandy said, beginning to think that he wasn't hallucinating, and that what was happening was real.

"By the way," John said putting his arm around a beautiful mermaid next to him, her red hair cascading down her shoulders, and her sea-green tail sparkling in the sunlight, her belly swollen in pregnacy. "This is Patrick, remember him?"

"Oh my god," Dawn said, suddenly sitting down on the sand, feeling the earth sway beneath her feet. "This WILL be a good story."

"You're getting better at telling this story," Danni observed as the evening sunset danced along the distant clouds over the western arm of the lagoon. "The last time it was completely dark by the time you finished."

"The last time?" Bill asked, still absorbing all the information that the mers had given him in the last four hours.

"Hank and Janice," Pat reminded him.

"And you were Robbie, Hank's son?" asked Sandy incredulously.

"It's Rose now," she said blushing.

"This is all so incredible," Dawn said.

"Yes, it is," Bill agreed. "Now I can see why Hank wanted us to come see for our selves. Frankly, I don't think I would have believed him over the radio."

"They plan on returning and joining us as soon as they tie up a few loose ends," John said.

"The whole family?" Sandy asked.

"Yes, along with some other key people," Pat continued. "We can't tell you more yet."

"Why not?" asked Mae.

"Because, my darling," Bill answered. "They do not know if we will leave or join them yet. If we leave, then it is best if we don't know some things. If we stay and join them, it will be necessary for us to know. Am I right?"

"Couldn't have put it better," John agreed.

"Well, then, it's past dinner time, and we have some decisions to make," Bill concluded. "Why don't you guys go eat, and we'll unload the boat and have a bite ourselves. We can talk more tomorrow morning."

"It will be quicker if we help you," Trevor offered. "We can ferry the stuff while some of you man the boat and others the beach."

"We can help too," Emma offered.

"Emma!" Cleo squealed in protest.

"Oh, be quiet," Rikki chided. "And NO, you are not going first with MuSu tonight."

"But it is her turn," MuSu said with a small smile.

"Oh, well then, in that case, she loses her turn if she complains," Emma said sweetly. MuSu nodded in agreement.

Cleo pouted at MuSu, but he was unmoved. Then she glared at her sisters but didn't say anything. In fact, she was extra well behaved and made more trips than anyone else, continuing to work as the stars began to twinkle, retrieving Dawn's medicine from the boat to help her sleep through her pain.

Turi handed the tiller over to his cousin, Tiki, a smaller Polynesian man who gripped it and glanced down at the compass at his feet.

"We keep this heading until tomorrow morning?" he asked.

"Yes," Turi answered.

"What are we looking for?" Tiki asked for the umpteenth time.

"People you do not know," Turi answered, feeling jumpy. Turi had been a petty thief until Manalo had hired him as a drug runner, and now he owed his life to Manalo. Sometimes he felt badly about dragging some of his family into "the business," and so he tried to keep them as ignorant as possible. Rangi was Tiki's best friend and Turi conscripted his boat for this mission. The final crewmember was Tuo Guo Han, a tall Chinese sailor that Manalo had insisted he bring along.

Turi didn't trust the larger Chinese man, who mostly kept to himself. English was the only common language among the four of them, and even Rangi didn't speak the same Tongic dialect as Turi did. Tiki was a bookworm as a child, and spoke several Polynesian dialects, but not Chinese. None of them spoke English well, but it would suffice.

The South Pacific was a big place, and it took days for boats to sail from one island to the next, sometimes several weeks. The sky stretched out in all directions like a purple blanket, littered with thousands of stars. Turi watched as Tiki gauged their position by the stars, a talent their ancestors had perfected. He hoped that his plans would not bring bad luck to Tiki, who he liked, but who would serve his purpose. His purpose was money. Manalo wouldn't tell him why they were searching for a man named Alberto and his gang, but Manalo's secretary accidentally let slip that Alberto had a lot of stolen money. A whole lot of money!

Turi wasn't a bad man, but he was a greedy man. He was sure that Manalo didn't suspect that Miss Chin had made the mistake, but it was one he hoped to capitalize upon. Manalo expected only a radio dispatch when Alberto was found, but Turi made new plans. He watched Tiki as his cousin made adjustments to their course, keeping them heading for the small island Turi suspected harbored Alberto and his men. Turi fingered the gun strapped to his leg. They would be in the area tomorrow, and if they moved quickly, he would steal the money, and then disappear himself into the South Pacific archipelago, a rich man.

"These men are bad men?" Tiki asked.

"Yes, we will gain much honor in ridding the world of them," Turi answered.

He wondered again, at the wisdom of lying to his cousins. If Tiki and Rangi discovered that Turi's primary purpose was the money, they might back out. They thought they were rescuing fellow islanders who had been kidnapped by Alberto. After they disposed of Alberto and his men, Turi planned on "discovering" the money. He had no idea what his cousins would think of the money, or if they would help him kill Manalo's spy, Tuo.

Phoebe looked up at Danni's face, watching her as her fifth orgasm rolled through her body.

"Enough," Danni gasped, holding her stomach as she tried to contain the convulsions that rolled through her abdomen. "I'll go into labor if you do any more."

"No you won't," Pat said. "Orgasms do not trigger labor."

"Yea," Phoebe said. "It's now or never, the bet was ten."

"Can't I bank them?" Danni asked, struggling to control her quivering body, the water around her misted with her own milk.

"Nope," Phoebe said. "Use them or lose them."

"How about you do Pat and then come back to me?" she suggested.

"The bet was ten ... unrequited and uninterrupted," Phoebe teased, moving her fingers yet again inside Danni's vent, flicking her thumb across her swollen clit.

"Then ... go ... ahead ... and ... do ... meeeeeeeeeee," Danni squealed as another wave of pleasure washed through her body.

"You better make sure you have enough energy left for me," Pat warned Phoebe as she jealously watched Danni thrash through her sixth orgasm.

"She better make sure she has enough energy left for me," John said, smiling wickedly.

"Wait a minute," Pat protested as she watched Danni reach yet another plateau of pleasure. "What about unrequited do you not understand?"

"From either of you," John said smiling. "I didn't take the bet."

"Cheater," Danni gasped, her chest heaving.

"Ha," Phoebe said, shoving her arm up into Danni all the way up to her elbow fin. "I believe this will be number eight," she said as she twisted her fist deep within Danni's still pulsing vagina.

Danni was twitching and mumbling incoherently by the time Phoebe was done with her. Phoebe then brought Pat to a similar state of delirium, while John watched nearby. After Danni collected the nearly unconscious Pat into her arms, Phoebe attacked John with a ferocity he had never seen from her before. An hour later, when all the milk had settled, Phoebe looked over the wreckage she had wrought upon her podmates.

"I'm up for another bet," she said perkily. "Any takers?"

The next morning, the mers radioed Hank and Janice from Bill's boat. Yes, they were all fine, and yes, they had discovered the "new species of marine mammals" on the island—the code Pat and John had agreed to with Hank and Janice, rather than chance some eavesdropper on the short wave radio hear "mermaid" over the airwaves. Hank told them that their "plans" were proceeding smoothly, and that they would return in a month or two, depending on the timing of some business deals. Janice asked Bill if they planned on "staying," and Bill reported that it looked possible, but that there were still some questions to be answered. They told them that "Rose" and Trevor were fine, having made the change, and there was silence on the other end for a few seconds. Janice finally said something about winning a bet, and everyone signed off.

When they reassembled on the beach, Bill, Mae, and Eve were genuinely intrigued about the possibilities of becoming mers, but they weren't rushing into any decision. Sandy, on the other hand, was desperate to have Dawn and himself make the transition. Dawn, however, was strangely reluctant.

"It would mean that you would have to give up everything," Dawn pleaded. "Your work, your inventions, everything that you've worked for your entire life."

"No, you are the only thing I refuse to give up," Sandy said firmly. "If it meant that I could save your life, I will happily become a mer."

"But we don't know if it will work," Dawn said. "The siren cell cures cuts, not cancer."

"But Pat, Alexis and Galina think it is worth a shot," Eve argued.

"But we wouldn't be human anymore," Dawn said fearfully.

"Says who?" Sandy asked. "Do John or Pat seem any less human to you?"

"I hardly knew them before," Dawn protested. "How could I compare?"

"Dawn, what is the real problem?" Eve asked, putting her arm around her best friend. "This could not only save your life, but it could make your life last for hundreds of years."

"Are you going to become a mermaid?" Dawn asked.

"I thought I might join you and Sandy, if that was alright," Eve said. "After all, there was that one night after the frat party that—"

"Alright," Dawn said, putting her hand over her friend's mouth. "Enough. I am afraid. I've got a bad feeling that something that will go wrong."

"We already know that you're going to die if we do nothing," Sandy argued. "I am ready to chance anything to have you healthy and with me."

"But it's you I'm worried about; you're the smallest man here," Dawn said softly, finally sharing what was most worrying her. "Even Eve is taller than you. I don't want to lose you as part of the price for becoming healthy."

"Nothing will take me away from you," Sandy reassured her.

"What if the two of you take some mermaid milk up to the hot tub for a few days with nobody else around," Eve suggested. "After you're both halfway changed, and Dawn has focused her energies on making Sandy taller, then you can come back to the water and make the change into mers with me?"

"Oh," Dawn said, thinking. "I hadn't thought of that. Sandy, would that be alright with you?"

"I don't care if you make me become a hulking he-man-mer," he said, giddy with joy. "As long as I'm with you, I don't care what I look like."

Joy Simpson angled her plane as she swept over the low atoll, its highest point barely a meter above sea level. The wave and wind swept sand was empty, and despite the teeming reefs that surrounded the small landmass, no human activity could be seen. She leveled her wings and continued south, following the grid she had mapped out earlier. The sleek turbojet made searching the Blackgate quadrant a snap, but it wouldn't allow her to get very close or to land on these remote islands.

When Mac first told her about the coincidence of the newly declared classified location and Sally's last known heading, her heart leapt in her chest. Sally confessed to Joy her childhood fascination with the sea in general and mermaids in particular when she was eight years old. The strength of the young girl's convictions that she would one day become a mermaid were imprinted on Joy's memory so vividly that she knew Sally was behind the Blackgate protocol. But real mermaids? Even that was a stretch for a woman who had spent her life finding and keeping some amazing secrets.

She had been flying up and down the quadrant for most of the morning, and she was about to cross over the imaginary halfway point of the Blackgate area. She noticed a small island on the horizon, not an atoll, but an island dominated by a small volcano, now apparently dormant. She glanced at her map; 399, an as yet unnamed island in the Republic of Kiribati. Why had the island remained unnamed, she wondered? Moving at over 300 nautical miles per hour, she prepared to circle the island at 15,000 feet.

Her sharp, well-trained eyes caught flashes of color scrambling off a southern beach and disappearing into the water, but she was too far away to see anything clearly. A few seconds later, she was over the island, slowing her speed, snapping hundreds of pictures with her highspeed /high-resolution camera. She began circling down to about 500 feet above the sea, until the tip of the small volcano was even with her wingtips. Whoever had been in the large lagoon along the southern edge of the island was no longer visible, though there were several huts along the edge of the beach where the sand met the jungle.

Someone was on that island, and there was a sailboat in the lagoon, but it did not match the old fishing boat that Sally and Eric bought in Suva. More to the point, there didn't seem to be any evidence that said "magic" or "terrorism," and Joy wasn't sure which term frightened her more. Sea Dancer, she noted in her log. She circled one last time, and pulled back to 15,000 feet, moving on to the next island on her map. Number 399 was a definite possibility, but she would need to return with either a seaplane or a boat. As she raced through the sky, she noted a storm approaching from the west and an islander fishing boat east of the island. In a few minutes, she was over the boat, and snapped a few shots, noting that it was headed towards the island. She swooped down for a closer look, and saw four men working nets. One of them, a Chinese man, waved at her as she swept by.

They didn't look like the people who had made those huts, and she couldn't be sure they were headed for the island. They were still at least 12 hours away, and even now, as she watched, the boat circled to the north. The storm would be in this area soon, and that was probably why the boat was turning around. She noted its position in her log, and resumed her sweep of the area.

What ever Sally had done, it was a doozy. Poor Mac, she thought to herself, his position was far too public, and the thought that Sally might be doing something that reflected badly on his reputation gnawed at him. It had been one of the reasons why she and Mac had never consummated any kind of relationship; her work with the CIA was a potential liability for a Navy career man, especially one who aspired to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

In any event, she would return in a few days, probably on a seaplane. She first needed to surreptitiously arrange all the logistical necessities, and then she could check out 399 for herself. She felt she owed at least that to Mac, and to his daughter.

"That was a close one," Pat said, as she watched the plane disappear into the distance.

"It was not a military plane," Sally offered, bobbing to the surface next to her.

"How can you tell?" Danni asked.

"All military aircraft are required by international law to have national markings on their aircraft," Sally explained. "That doesn't mean that the plane isn't connected to some other governmental agency, just that it wasn't a Navy or Air force plane."

"You could see the plane that well from underwater?" Danni asked.

"Yea, it's great being a mermaid, isn't it?" Sally smiled.

"So, what are we going to do?" asked Danni.

"Let's wait for about twenty minutes, to make sure the plane isn't returning, and then get back to the beach to meet with Sandy and Dawn," Pat said. "Is that about right?"

"Yes," Sally nodded. "If the pilot is linked to me, it will take a few more hours to finish the Blackgate quadrant. It wouldn't return until later tonight or tomorrow morning."

"Good," Pat said. "I don't think that Dawn should wait another day before beginning her treatment to see if we can cure her cancer."

"These eight bottles should last you until tomorrow afternoon," Pat explained to Dawn and Sandy. "You should finish these two first, and see how it goes from there. If you can feel the cancer going away, then it's safe to have more."

"Why are we waiting between doses?" Sandy asked.

"Because, if the mermaid milk works, you two can continue to be alone, and focus on making you her mate," Pat explained. "But if the cancer isn't being cured, you shouldn't drink any more, or you risk Sandy not being able to remain a man."

"I will be fine," Sandy said to her. "Eve has already volunteered to be restrained, if necessary, so that I can still physically dominate her. The only bad thing that can happen is that the mermaid milk doesn't cure cancer."

"You should still wait until we have all those circumstances set up," Pat explained. "Once you build up enough of the siren cells in your body, you become vulnerable to outside influences or even those within your own imagination."

"How can we tell that her cancer is being cured?" Sandy asked.

"Healing is usually accompanied by feelings of pain, mostly mild, because any time cells regenerate, our nerves send signals to our brain that are very similar to the ones for pain."

"So, if after I start drinking the milk," Dawn asked, "I start to feel pain, that's a good thing."

"Yes," Pat reassured her.

"And if I don't?" she asked.

"The siren cell isn't recognizing the cancer as a wound or invasive," Pat said. "Cancer cells are still your own cells, after all. We have no idea if the siren cell can tell the difference."

"And so Sandy shouldn't have any more milk until we get Eve ready to help him?" Dawn asked.

"Right," Pat said. "But we can worry about that tomorrow morning, because you will know as soon as you have your first dose."

"Well, at least Sandy would be fulfilling his promise," Dawn said, with a sad smile.

"What promise is that?" Eve asked.

"He would become your mate," Dawn said, stroking her best friend's cheek. "I made him promise that he would remarry when I died. Becoming your merman-pod-mate would fulfill that promise."

"All of that is nonsense," Eve said brusquely. "You will be fine, and we will both become his pod-mates. Now, off with you two, and don't come back until you're cured."

"Don't forget there will be a big storm tonight, so stay close to the huts," Pat warned them.

"How can you tell?" Sandy asked.

"Mer-senses," Pat explained. "Storms have enormous electrical discharges, and we can usually sense them when they are a few hours away, depending on how big they are."

"How big will this one be?" Dawn asked.

"Hard to tell," Pat answered. "If it is here in an hour, it's a relatively small one. The longer it takes, the bigger it is."

"So, if we don't see a storm before we fall asleep, it will be a big one?" Dawn asked.

"Yes," Pat agreed, looking at the early afternoon sun, still bright and warm in the western sky. "We should all hunker down if the storm isn't here by darkness."

"What about our boat?" Mae asked.

"Is everything harvested from it?" John asked.

"Yes," Bill answered. "The radio is in the lab cave now, and the antennae is tied to the gun's cabling. Gabriel and Galina tested it this morning."

"And you're staying?" John asked.

"Yes," Bill nodded. "Regardless of what happens with Dawn and Sandy, Mae and I will start a new pod."

"Then why don't we tow the boat out into the storm, and let the sea take care of it," John said. "You and Mae can come back to the caves tonight and get started, if you want."

"What about Eve?" Dawn asked. "She can't stay on the beach all by herself, and she can't come up to the mountainside huts because ..."

"I'll go back to the caves too," Eve suggested, knowing how worried Dawn was. "I will wait to start my transformation until after we find out what happens with your cancer."

"O.K., I guess we should get started," Dawn said, holding her hand out for her husband.

The mers and Bill, Mae, and Eve watched as Dawn and Sandy walked into the jungle, headed for the mountainside camp. After they disappeared into the jungle, Bill turned to his wife.

"Are you ready to become a mermaid?" he asked.

"I'm ready to become your mermaid," Mae said, smiling.

After they reached the mountainside huts, Sandy and Dawn looked out at the island below them. They could see Bill's boat being slowly towed out to the west, but they couldn't see any storm clouds on the horizon yet. Bill, Mae, and Eve used the boat one last time to sail over to the entrance to the western caves, and then the mers helped them reach the Moon Pool by breathing for them. Bill and Mae would start their first feeding, and they could transition the next day. Everyone had agreed not to return to the beach to give Dawn as much time as possible to help Sandy's change into a larger man before Eve was brought into the picture.

Dawn looked at the food they had stockpiled to help Sandy grow bigger. The mers explained that the siren cell would change them quite a bit, but depending on how big Dawn hoped Sandy might become, they risked his health if his body were forced to cannibalize itself too much. The siren cell made their mer bodies incredibly efficient at using and storing food energy, but it could not create something from nothing. Sandy had already eaten as much as he could stand.

"You ready?" she asked.

"Yes," he answered, holding out their first doses.

She took the plastic bottle filled with the milky white substance, and began to drink. The first few gulps went down easily, an unexpected sweetness filling her senses. She finished the dose and looked at her husband as he finished his. She was filled yet again with a deep affection for this man. His blue eyes sparkled and his pale blond hair fell across his forehead. He was only a few inches taller than she was, but he had been a tower of stability, love, and hope in her life.

"Do you feel anything yet?" he asked.

"No, not yet," she said. "I feel a warmth in my belly, but it will probably take a few minutes before the milk reaches my intestines and from there into my bloodstream, and finally to where the cancer is."

"I love you," he said, and stroked her blond hair away from her green eyes. "And you can make me into anything you like, even like Jason."

"Are you still jealous over that meathead/jock?" she teased. "You have to remember that I married you, not him."

Jason was her last boyfriend before she and Sandy had started dating. He was a lacrosse player, about six foot two inches tall (190 cm). In fact, all of Dawn's boyfriends had been big men, usually jocks, the exact opposite of Sandy.

"And, I'm not going to turn you into any kind of jock," she said. "I love you just the way you are, but we can make you taller than Eve at least."

Sandy smiled as he looked at his wife, still beautiful despite the disease that had ravaged her body. They sat together for many minutes, just content to be with each other. Suddenly, Dawn doubled over in pain, moaning. She fell to the ground, clutching her lower abdomen.

"Does it hurt?" he asked hopefully.

Dawn writhed on the ground, feeling great waves of pain roll through her womb. It felt like the worst cramps possible, like a million tiny explosions of pain in her guts, a relentless throbbing of agony. Despite the pain that vibrated through her, she raised her head to her husband, and looked up at him through tears of joy mixed with tears of pain.

"It hurts ... so much," she gasped. "It hurts ... so good."

The storm lashed the boat as Turi struggled to make anchor in the lee of the island. Lightening raced across the sky, illuminating the dark rows of rocks that stretched like teeth across the eastern shore of the island. They were only a few meters from one of the sandy beaches when suddenly the boat came to a grinding halt, screeching across a large rock that ripped through the boat.

"Make for beach," Turi ordered as he headed for the side of the boat. "Water deep, walk to beach," he shouted, and leapt over the side.

He was loaded down with guns, ammo, and supplies. They had spotted the storm about two hours ago, in the middle of the night, and they raced for the island, hoping to make landfall before it struck. Each man was loaded down with supplies, and as they approached the island, they had abandoned their life jackets in favor of more supplies, confident that they could wade ashore.

Turi found himself under water, the waves crashing on rocks above his head. He started for the shallower water, ready to hold his breath for a few minutes, but fingering the release that would deposit his pack on the ocean floor and allow him to float to the surface, an old islander trick. He made it to the shelter of the cove easily, and turned to watch as the other three men also made it ashore.

"Off beach and find shelter in jungle," he shouted above the noise of the storm.

The three other men nodded, and they all struggled up the cliff that sheltered this small beach. As soon as they poked their faces above the rim of the rocks, wind and rain lashed down on them. They all stumbled into the jungle, and Turi signaled for another stop.

"Storm cover," he shouted as the storm raged. "We go inland, keep guns ready if find Alberto. Leave supplies here," he indicated a large tree with a hollow bowl on one side.

They loaded their supplies into the small hollow. Tiki and Rangi gingerly took the guns Turi handed to them, and then followed him into the jungle.

Even though the mers had all fallen asleep earlier, the storm's power woke everyone up. Eve was the first to awaken, the thunder echoing down the chimney. She stretched and looked around the cave by the light of the pale bioluminescence flickering from the pool below, a light that was augmented occasionally by lightening that flashed from above. Bill and Mae lay cuddled together, already looking younger from their first two feedings the previous evening, while the mers slowly rose up from the Moon Pool, pod by pod.

"Now this is a storm," Emma said appreciatively, looking at the sky through the chimney hole high above the pool.

"Why did you guys wake up?" Eve asked. "You can't hear the storm underwater, can you?"

"Well, it's more that the storm's electrical fields make it hard to sleep," Pat explained. "There's too much energy in the water."

"It's sort of like being at a rock concert," Rikki added. "Lots of lights and noise, but it's hard to make out individual words and songs."

"Is that why you didn't post a patrol tonight?" Bill asked, rising.

"Yes, there are limits to our mer-senses," Pat agreed. "We would only be able to sense someone approaching the island if they were practically on top of us."

"That is a tactical issue we would need to solve," Sally observed. "Someone could sneak up on us during a storm, and we would not be able to distinguish them among all the electrical noise."

"Oh, my, are we in any danger?" Eve asked.

"No," John said. "We can still sense any intruders here, and even out to the main tunnel entrance. Normally we can sense large predators and boats in the water when they are still a ways off, several miles usually if the boat is big enough. During a storm, our range is much less."

"Well, what should we do?" asked Danni. "We are all awake, and the storm has got Freya all riled up."

"Cynthia too," Phoebe added. "How are you feeling Alexis?"

"I'm fine," Alexis said. "But I'm only six weeks pregnant."

"Mermaids don't get morning sickness?" Mae asked, incredulous.

"Not as far as we can tell," Alexis said.

"It barely feels like we are pregnant until the last two months," Petra said. "The only way we can tell for sure is that our electrical signals change."

"Well, why don't we give Bill and Mae a third feeding so that they can make the transition earlier," Pat suggested.

"We can do that?" Bill asked.

"Yes," Pat answered. "We are still experimenting, of course, but it only takes three to four hours for the full effects of a single feeding to become apparent. You had two last night, and if you do a third now, you can start the transition with breakfast instead of lunch."

"Which would be good, because then we can check in with Dawn and Sandy after lunch, which should be enough time for Sandy's changes to get locked in," Eve said. "Which means I won't be the only old lady left."

"You're not an old lady," Mae teased.

"Oh yes I am," Eve said. "You look twenty years younger, and prettier too."

"Who's turn is it to feed?" Pat asked.

"Ours!" the triplets shouted.

"Well, it can't be all three of you," Pat said, smiling. "Pick two of you."

Cleo and Rikki beat Emma out of the pool and gathered Bill and Mae into their embraces.

"Not fair," Emma pouted.

"Life's not always fair," Bill said as he gave a wink to his wife, who was attached to Cleo's breast watching him, and then lowered his own lips to Rikki's stiff nipple. The warm mermaid milk gushed from her breast, and he heard Rikki moan.

"Being a feeder is so cool," Rikki said breathlessly.

"Yea," Cleo agreed, cradling Mae's head to her breast. "I can't wait until we have our own children."

"Well, I can," Emma groused as she watched her sisters swoon as they fed Bill and Mae.

MuSu smiled in his usual semi-detached and understated way. "I am always at your service," he said without any hint of irony. "Do you wish to practice making children while they feed?"

"Practice only?" Emma said warily.

"My flower, only you can determine when you become pregnant," MuSu said, still smiling enigmatically.

"Then let's go!" Emma said, waddling towards the edge of the Moon Pool. "I always wanted to make love in a storm."

"Stay on the western side," Pat warned, floating in the pool, feeling her belly shift as Maureen kicked. "And don't get closer than a few meters to the surface. This storm is a big one," she finished as a particularly loud thunderclap echoed in the chamber.

"Not fair," Rikki cried.

"Life's not fair, remember," Bill chided her as he held her breast in his hands. "Stop squirming, I'm trying to feed here."

Four of the eight doses of mermaid milk were on the table, untouched. Sandy could not reach them. His hands were tied behind his back, and legs were bound together. The typhoon still raged outside, and he could see the four men huddle over his wife on the other side of the hut. The fury that burned in his heart equaled the fury of the storm that lashed against the hut, the wind and rain roaring through the seemingly insubstantial bamboo hut. As his fury increased, so too did the pain in his wrists as he struggled against his bonds.

"Let go of her," he screamed in his now slightly deeper voice. His larger muscles bulged against the ropes. "Do anything you want to me, but leave her alone!"

The four men did not acknowledge him, but they finished tying up his wife, turned and left the hut, dashing to the other huts nearby.

"Are you alright?" Sandy asked.

"I'm fine," Dawn said, holding back her tears.

"What were they doing to you?" he asked.

"Nothing, just tying me up," she answered.

"Can you move?" he asked, still struggling against the bonds that held him.

"Yes, only my hands are tied together," she said.

"Can you come over to the bed?" he grunted, still trying to escape the ropes that held him.

"I think so," she said, and rose to her knees.

Sandy Halbst watched as his wife crawled over to the bed on her knees. Even in the darkness, he could see that her hair was long, again, and her body had filled back out, thanks to the second dose of mermaid milk they consumed after it was clear that the cancer was cured. When lightening flashed across the sky, he could see that she looked twentyfive again, but she had a bruise on her cheek from the struggle they had put up as the islander men tied them up. The men surprised them while they were sleeping, but the bump on Sandy's temple was already receding as the mermaid milk did its work. Unfortunately, he had been unconscious while they tied him up.

Dawn struggled to reach her husband, who also looked twenty-five, but not the same twenty-five he looked seven years ago. He was now nearly five feet ten inches tall, and he weighed about 170 pounds, no longer the five foot six inch tall geek. But he was nearly mad with helplessness as he struggled against the ropes that bound him.

"Stop," she sobbed. "You're wrists are bleeding! You'll kill yourself."

"No, I won't," he growled. "There is too much mermaid milk in our veins. I heal as fast as I cut myself."

"No, you're bleeding. Let me try," she urged. "Stop moving."

After a few tense moments of trying to untie the complicated knots on his hands, the men walked back into the hut.

"Back," Turi tersely ordered. "Move there," he pointed to the other side of the hut.

Dawn didn't move, but just glared at the men. Turi jerked his head at the other two islanders who reluctantly strode forward, gently picked her up, and carried her across the room. Sandy thrashed on the bed.

"Leave her the fuck alone!" he screamed, falling onto the floor in his struggle.

"You stop or she die," Turi said quietly, pointing his gun at Dawn.

Sandy lay still, breathing heavily, wishing that his transformation into a stronger man was complete. He scanned the room, searching for something to change the balance of power in the room.

"Where Alberto?" Turi asked both of them.

"We don't know any Alberto," Sandy said. "We are alone here on this island."

"How long?" he asked.

"A few days," Sandy answered.

"Then who build this?" Turi asked, waving his hand around the room.

"We don't know," Dawn said.

"You lie," Turi said, moving the gun closer to Dawn. "Where Alberto?"

"She's telling you the truth," Sandy said, gritting his teeth. "Why won't you believe us?"

"Alberto no let these live," Tuo said. "He gone or dead."

Sandy examined the four men as the frequent lightening illuminated each. The islander that seemed in charge was a small man, only about five foot five, and the two others were even shorter. The Chinese man was tall, over six feet, and seemed to have a hidden strength to him. Perhaps the Chinaman would be an ally.

"If dead, where money?" Turi shouted above the noise of the storm.

"We search after," Tuo suggested, indicating the storm outside. He noticed that Tiki and Rangi scowled at Turi's greed.

"We kill them if no money," Turi shouted. "Where Alberto's money?" he demanded, moving the gun closer to Dawn's head.

"We don't know what you're talking about," Sandy said, trying to remain calm. "We are Americans, and my wife has cancer. We came here to enjoy her last few months together," he said, nearly bringing himself to tears.

The three islander men exchanged some tense words in Tongan that ended when Turi pointed his gun at his cousins. They both slowly handed their guns to him and sank to the floor, looking defeated.

Tuo looked closely at the two cousins, trying to gauge their actions. The four of them had just left the hut to argue about the "rescue" they were attempting. After two hours of searching in the roaring wind and rain, they had discovered these two Americans. There were more huts on the beach, but no sign of Alberto, and there were no signs of a large Filipino drug gang. Tiki and Rangi wanted to know why they were tying up these Westerners, who were clearly a young married couple who had escaped to this island. They knew that Alberto and his men were Filipino or Asian, with some Australians, but no Americans, and certainly not this woman. Turi argued that they knew where Alberto was, and thus the standoff in which they were now engaged.

"Kill no good," Tuo said, biding his time, keeping his hand on his holster. "Hostage useful."

Tuo smiled at Tiki and Rangi. Even though they were family to Turi, he suspected that this part of the trip was a surprise to them. Tuo was not surprised; Shen Chin had warned him that Turi would try something. Tuo wasn't worried, either; he was bigger, stronger, and quicker than any of them. He thought back to the day Shen Chin had found him, nearly dead, drunk on a street corner in Suva. She nursed him back to health, and offered him a path to regain his honor. He was to help her find out what happened to Alberto so that she could form a plan to rescue her sister and steal the money for herself. Tuo Guo Han would give his life to do as Shen Chin had asked. Only Alberto and his men would be killed, and Turi now, if necessary.

"Useful?" Turi demanded, turning but keeping his gun on Dawn. He knew better than to aim his gun at Tuo, who could easily kill him, unlike his weaker cousins.

"Hostage make money," Tuo said calmly.

"No," Turi said, pointing his gun at Sandy. "Much trouble. Tell me where money!"

Tuo's hand motion was so quick that Dawn didn't see him move. Turi's hand was suddenly pointed at the ceiling, his wrist firmly in Tuo's grasp.

"No," Tuo said calmly. "Kill no good."

The two men looked at each other fiercely for a few tense moments, then Turi relaxed in the Chinaman's grip.

"I only fisherman," he said smiling. "No fighter. Try to feed family."

"No kill," Tuo repeated, unmoving.

"No kill," Turi agreed.

Turi lowered his arm and made a show of putting away his gun. Internally, he seethed. How dare this man show him up in front of his family! He would get his revenge. He would find a way to surprise Tuo.

Joy scrolled through the hundreds of photographs she had taken, looking for any clues as to why, or even if, Sally and Eric were on that island.

"No, don't send any of them to me, I don't have a secure email account," Mac said over the phone.

"Secure from whom?" Joy teased, knowing the answer. Mac was frustrated because he could get a disposable cell phone to talk to Joy or other people he didn't want the Navy to know about, but all electronic communication that he "officially" used was bugged. "You'll just have to trust my judgment."

"I do, you know that," Mac stammered. "It's just that it's my daughter, for god's sake."

"I know, Mac," she said. "Settle down. The boat is registered to a Bill Williams in San Francisco, and while he has been associated with Green Peace in the past, he has never participated in any of the more outrageous acts against shipping or forestry that some of them have."

"I won't ask how you got all that information so quickly," Mac said humorously.

"That's because you already know," Joy said. "It looks safe, a remote place granted, but lots safer than other places I've had to drop in upon."

"Take your satellite phone?" Mac asked.

"Not unless you don't want to keep this investigation private," she answered. "You'll have to wait until we both get back to more anonymous phone lines. Trust me Mac, I think I would sense something if Sally were in trouble or if this was something beyond a potentially embarrassing environmental statement by your headstrong daughter. I've checked with some folks, and Bill and Mae Williams are good people, not crazies. What ever they are doing there, it isn't dangerous."

"Who have you checked with?" Mac demanded.

"You know better than to ask me such things," Joy chided him. "Now grow up, and relax. I'll talk to you in a few days."

"You're going back?" he asked.

"Yes, the day after tomorrow, with a seaplane and a lot of questions," she answered.

"You think she's there?" he asked again.

"If she's not on that island, I'll buy you dinner in Paris," she said softly. "With all the trimmings."

"All the trimmings?" he asked, surprised.

"Well, we're both not getting any younger, and the trimmings are not what they used to be," she said. "But you're about the only person in my life I still care about, and if our long delayed but never consummated evening in Paris can show you that, then that's what I'll do."

"How about we do Paris first, and then you find my daughter?" he said.

"I'll tell her that you said that when I see her in two days," she said, laughing as she hung up the phone.

Emma watched as the water roiled above them, the storm unleashing its fury upon the water. She could feel the incredible power of the storm with her mer-senses, and the water around her seemed to crackle with energy. She stretched out her body, feeling the water around her, as she drifted slowly two meters below the surface, pushing herself gently with her flukes. Her arms were spread out, her chest was thrust forward, and her tail curled in a semi-circle behind her. She let herself be carried by the water, and she felt the force and power of the storm pass safely over her.

Below her, MuSu swam lazily on his back, watching his mate trying to absorb the power of the storm, watching her beautiful body move through the dark water, her tail, flukes, and fins glowing with the familiar blue and white flashes of arousal. He pushed himself up towards her, pulling on his vent to free his stiff cock, letting it poke into the water as he swam towards Emma.

Emma smiled down at him, and for a brief instant, MuSu could see Martin's gentle spirit within her flashing blue eyes. His heart clutched as he remembered Martin's kindness when he was Mai Lin, and (she) thought that Alberto had finally hurt her enough to kill her. Emma too sensed something different, a glow in MuSu's eyes that was more than his usual glow.

"Do you remember the night we were rescued?" Emma asked, bringing her hands back to her body. "Neither one of us looked like this," she said, cradling her breasts in her hands as she pushed herself through the water.

"No," MuSu agreed, his own tail flashing with yellow lights as he brought himself close to his pod-mate. "But you were always special to me, Martin or Emma."

"And now we are together with my sisters," she said, feeling both the power of the storm above and the rising passion from MuSu below.

"When will we make children?" he asked.

"Soon," Emma whispered, twisting her body through the water, making MuSu keep up with her as they swam calmly under the raging sea. "I thought we were going to just practice," she teased, still keeping her body moving through the water as she tugged on her own breasts, feeling them grow heavy with her arousal.

"If you stop, we can—" MuSu said with a tinge of frustration, as he angled his cock towards her vent but missed.

"Dolphins do it moving, so can we," Emma said, adding a side-to-side motion with her hips as her tail still moved up and down, meandering through the strangely quite water, even as the storm tossed the waves above back and forth above them.

MuSu smiled, understanding her game. He put more effort into swimming, and began to corkscrew around her body, brushing her with his cock, fins, and fingers as he twirled around her slowly undulating body. Emma gasped in pleasure as MuSu grazed her body, her breasts, and her tail with his. Her vent pulsed with need, filling with blood, opening itself to the sea, but she kept swimming forward, making a large arc back towards the cliff face, where the waves crashed against the island.

MuSu gave a strong and well-timed stroke with his tail, and sank his cock into Emma's exposed vent. He doubled his efforts, pulling her along by the force of their union, her body being pushed forward by his strong tail strokes, linking them together with his cock now firmly embedded within her. Emma moaned in appreciation, savoring the feelings of MuSu's body pressed to her own even as they both built up speed, each trying to tease the other. She stopped swimming herself, and focused on wrapping her body around her lover's as he swam through the water. She pressed her breasts against his chest, and nuzzled her lips into his neck. She let her tail flutter below his, caressing his lower tail with her flukes, her pelvic fins beating against his, responding to the rhythmic motions of MuSu's swimming.

MuSu was a strong swimmer, and the pressure of his cock on her clitoris was too much for Emma to ignore. On their third lap past the face of the cliffs, Emma dissolved into a massive orgasm in which she lost all control of her tail and torso, and she was propelled forward in the water solely by MuSu's cock, throbbing within her. She buried her head in MuSu's chest, and hung on as her body convulsed around his stiff penis. It was one of the best orgasms she had since becoming a mermaid, and it was better than any fantasy Martin ever dreamed about.

When they came to a stop, near the entrance to the cave, Rikki and Cleo were waiting for them.

"What ever that was, we want a piece of that," Cleo said, nearly panting.

"We could feel your orgasms even as we finished up with Bill and Mae," Rikki said. "You didn't decide to become pregnant, did you?"

"No," Emma signed, still twitching with pleasure as MuSu's cock still throbbed, stiff as ever, within her.

"Then what did you do?" Rikki demanded.

"It's easy," Emma sighed, reluctantly pulling herself free from MuSu's cock. "Just keep swimming slowly until he catches you."

"That's it?" Cleo asked, incredulous.

"Then let him pull both of you through the water," she said, kissing MuSu deeply.

"What's so special about that?" Cleo asked.

"With only his cock," Emma said with a deliriously happy smile.

"Ohhhh," Cleo squealed understanding, and she began to swim slowly out into the storm.

"Take your time," Emma said to MuSu with a smile.

"But not too much time," Rikki warned.

The storm was fading as the morning sun broke through the receding clouds. The sounds of the jungle filled the air with birds and the breeze wafting through the damp undergrowth. Turi fingered the gun at his side in the early morning light, looking intently at Tuo's back. He raised his hand and closed his fingers around the trigger. He paused and sighted down the barrel, trying to stop his hand from shaking.

"What are you doing?" Tiki asked in Polynesian.

"Stay out of this," Turi hissed, watching Tuo turn in his sleep.

"No," Tiki said. "This is unworthy of you cousin. There is no honor here."

"There is honor in five million American dollars," Turi said as he brought his other arm up to steady the gun.

Tiki reached across the floor and grabbed Turi's arm, but he was not as strong or as quick as Tuo. The two men struggled, and several shots rang out. Dawn startled awake as the two men scuffled, and watched as the bullets sprayed the room. She screamed. Tuo sprang from the floor and snatched the gun from Turi's waving hand. He tossed it out the window, and gave a quick chop to Turi's neck. The smaller man went limp, unconscious. Tiki groaned.

"I hit," he said, holding his stomach.

Dawn turned to Sandy and saw a deep red gash along his forehead where one of the bullets had grazed his skull. She quickly crawled to his side, and probed the wound with her nearly insensitive fingers. She met bone, solid bone the whole length of the scar. Thank God! However, he was bleeding badly, the mermaid milk was now less active in his body, and the open gash was not closing very quickly. Sandy would be all right if she could get him some mermaid milk.

"Help me," she pleaded to Tuo.

"How?" he asked.

"The bottles; they heal. Give me one," she said urgently.

"Him?" Tuo asked, indicating Tiki who was bleeding profusely.

"Take one for him, pour a little on the wound and have him drink the rest," she urged. "I need one for Sandy," she pleaded, nearly to the point of tears.

Tuo ran to the table, and grabbed two bottles of the four bottles. He thrust one into Sally's hands, took the other, and poured some on Tiki's stomach, helping him drink the rest.

"Tuo shot," Rangi said, pointing at Tuo's leg from across the room.

Tuo looked down and saw the blood pouring from his calf. He glanced back at Tiki and could see that the substance in the bottles was in fact mending Tiki's stomach. He ran back to the table and grabbed another bottle. He splashed some on his leg, and chugged the rest down.

"You shot?" he asked.

"No," Rangi answered.

"Then why blood?" Tuo asked, pointing at the wall behind Rangi's back where a deep red stain was spreading.

Rangi turned and looked at the wall and then at his side. A small hole was in his abdomen, and a larger hole was in his back. He looked stupidly at Tuo.

"I shot," he said dreamily. "Good."

"Kill no good," Tuo repeated, grabbed the last bottle, and limped over to Rangi, his leg tingling and his head feeling dizzy. "Drink," he ordered after he splashed some white liquid over Rangi's wounds.

"No," he said. "I dishonored. Turi bring dishonor."

"Drink," Tuo repeated, forcing some liquid down the dazed man's throat.

Dawn tried to force more milk between Sandy's unconscious lips, but she could barely hold the bottle. She whimpered in frustration.

"Help me," she pleaded again.

Tuo withdrew a knife from a sheath strapped to his leg and sliced the ropes at her wrist with a single stroke. She nearly dropped the bottle with the release of pressure, but she managed to hold it upright. She tried to raise the bottle to Sandy's face, but her arms were asleep, and her legs too would not follow her brain's orders to action. She was nearly weeping with frustration as Tuo finished freeing both Dawn and Sandy from their bindings.

"I can't ... I can't," she sobbed, as her arms refused to raise themselves from her lap.

Tuo took the bottle gently from her hand, and sat down next to her. He lifted the unconscious man into his lap. He dripped some milk along the gash and then tilted Sandy's head back until his throat opened and put the bottle to his lips. Sandy gagged at first, and then reflexively gulped a few drafts of milk down. He did not regain consciousness, but his bleeding slowed, and the wound began to close.

Dawn collapsed next to Sandy and Tuo, trying to regain her composure. Something was wrong, and raw fear was pressing on her chest like an elephant. She couldn't get her breath. She looked up and saw Tuo pushing Sandy's hair from his face, and in an instant, she knew what was wrong. However, as she struggled to shout out her warning, her exhaustion, fear, and relief overcame her, and she fainted onto the floor.

"Everything be better," Tuo said softly.

He looked around the room and saw that no one was conscious to hear him. He could feel his own body buzzing, and his leg was quickly healing. He didn't know why, but he thought that both of the two blond Americans were very attractive. With that thought puzzling him, he also succumbed to the healing sleep of the mermaid's milk.

The shots that rang out in the mountainside hut went unobserved in the listening room; no one was there. Eve, who was waiting in the Moon Pool cave, thought she heard some faint popping, like logs burning in a fire, echoing down from the chimney high above. But with the humming from the pool below, it was hard to tell what she heard. Below her, in the pool, Bill was finishing his transition into a merman.

Mae had gone first, and the final step in the transformation from a forty-two-year-old woman into the stunning mermaid with long blond hair, a yellow and blue mottled tail with pink fringes had taken only twenty minutes. Now Bill was nearly done, his maroon tail with yellow highlights matching his still curly red hair. His hair now reached halfway down his back, and his long body arched backwards upon itself for a few seconds before he relaxed in the water.

Eve sighed. She felt old now, every single one of her thirty-two years. She watched wistfully as the mers collapsed into their pods, each making love with one another. She felt her own passion rise. She hoped that Sandy and Dawn were well on their own way, the cancer cured, and then she could join them in transition later.

Dawn was the first to regain consciousness. She looked around the hut, saw the deep red stains all around the room, and shuddered again at the memory. She saw Sandy breathing evenly, his forehead nearly healed, his head resting on Tuo's lap. She rose to lift Sandy away from the tall Chinese man, but a groan from Turi stopped her. He was stirring.

Thinking quickly, she took the ropes that had bound Sandy and rushed over to Turi. He was still mostly unconscious, and she bound his hands behind his back before he started to move with some purpose. It took her many minutes to get his hands tied securely enough for her to be satisfied.

"Do legs," a soft voice whispered.

She spun around and saw Rangi opening his eyes, looking at her.

"He do kung fu," he said, struggling awake. "Tie legs."

Dawn scrambled around the room, looking for more rope, cursing her still tired, bruised and sore limbs. She found some long enough and began binding Turi's legs together. By now, he was beginning to moan inarticulately in Tongan, which Dawn did not understand.

"More," Rangi struggled to say. "He a bad man."

Dawn was desperate to reach Sandy, but she knew that none of them would be safe if Turi got free. She found another piece of rope, and then following Rangi's directions, she looped part of it around his neck, under his hands, and then down to his ankles. She bent them up and secured the rope between his now bent ankles and the loop that went around his neck. Just as she finished the last knot, Turi snapped awake, nearly strangling himself as he struggled to get free of the ropes.

"Good," Rangi said, smiling, his eyes fluttering as he struggled to stay awake.

"Free me!" Turi demanded, choking himself on his own effort to get loose.

Dawn, seeing that he was indeed securely bound, ignored his demands and went to Tuo's and Sandy's side. She sank to the floor beside the two unconscious men, and tried to stop the sobs that welled up in her throat. Sandy's face had already lost the angles of masculinity he possessed that morning, and his hair was now down to his shoulders. The exposure to Tuo and the mermaid milk they all had consumed had begun his journey into femininity. She looked up into Tuo's still unconscious face and saw his increased masculinity, his broader shoulders, and she collapsed onto both of them.

"Oh, Sandy my love," she cried. "What have I done?"

Eve sprinted up the jungle path, her heart pounding, a Russian Gsh-18 pistol clutched in her hand. After Bill and Mae had finished changing, and the mers had had their sexual release, MuSu's pod had go to the listening room for a bit of rest time, not needing quite the same level of sexual workout as the other mers. There, they heard deep voices coming from the mountainside huts, voices that were not Sandy's or Dawn's. The mers rushed over to the lagoon, armed Eve with some canteens and a gun, and sent her up the mountain. She had no thought in her head as to what she would do when she got there, but she ran like a woman possessed.

MuSu's pod and Bill and Mae each circled the island in opposite directions, looking for the boat the strange men must have used. Bill and Mae found it first, and saw that it was ruined. Mae sent out a vocal pulse that indicated they had found something, and they waited for MuSu's pod to arrive. When they did, MuSu and Rikki leapt up into the stranded boat and gathered what materials they could find that could tell them who these people were. Then, the six of them swam quickly back to the lagoon.

As Eve neared the mountainside huts, she could see people moving around inside the largest hut. She crouched down, hiding in the undergrowth along the side of the path. Suddenly a large Chinese man emerged from the doorway carrying another man on his back. The smaller man was bound and gagged but still struggling. Behind him, she watched as Dawn and Sandy emerged too, and then behind them two more islander men followed. No one had any weapons that she could see.

She jumped out into the path, brandishing her gun.

"Sandy, Dawn!" she shouted. "Run!"

"It's O.K. Eve," Sandy said softly. "We're O.K."

"Sandy?" Eve asked. "What's wrong with your voice?"

Sandy lay on the warm sand, listening to Liga explain to Tiki and Rangi, in broken Tongan, what the mermaid milk had done to them. MuSu had already explained things to Tuo, who now stood alone on the beach, facing the water, absorbing the shock of meeting the mers and the knowledge that the milk they consumed had started them on an irreversible journey. Next to him, he could still feel Dawn's quiet sobs as she struggled with the news that only Tuo's death could alter Sandy's fate.

The last thing in the world that Sandy wanted was to cause the death of someone else, especially when that someone else had saved their lives. He had no desire to become a mermaid, but according to Pat's sad pronouncement, the process of bonding had already started. Eric explained that he could already see the tendrils of energy that linked Dawn, Sandy, and Tuo together, that their bonds would never go away, and that only Tuo's death would allow Sandy to return to masculinity.

He could already feel his changed body, his hair was down to his shoulders, his hips had been aching all day, and his limbs felt smaller than they had the day before. He could still feel his cock in between his legs, but he didn't want to check.

It had been a long afternoon, trying to get everyone's stories out. Tuo's was the easiest because thanks to MuSu and Xing, nearly all the mers spoke perfect Mandarin. Only Liga and Alexis spoke much Tongan/Polynesian, but Sally and Eric were learning quickly. Turi had refused to talk, and so he remained tied up in one of the huts on the beach. Hearing Shen Chin's story from Tuo had surprised everyone, especially when Tuo mentioned that he was supposed to radio her on a special frequency later that evening.

Sandy raised himself up to his elbows and looked out at the gathered mers. John's pod was entirely in the water, all his mermaids were very pregnant and now found land to be nearly unbearable. Everyone else was on the beach, waiting as Liga finished answering Tiki's and Rangi's questions. He could see Tuo shrug his shoulders and begin to walk down the beach away from them. He immediately sensed that Tuo was going to harm himself.

"Tuo," he called out.

Tuo turned and looked. Sandy waved him to return to the group, and he slowly began walking towards them.

"Dawn," he said rising up to a sitting position. "Dawn, we can't let Tuo die. He saved our lives."

"But," she sobbed. "What about you and me, us?"

"We will be sister-wives," he said. "Isn't that what you call it?" he asked Alexis who was nearby.

"Yes," she answered. "Sally and Liga are as much to me as Eric, sometimes more."

"See honey," he said, lifting her chin. "We will always be together, we will still be pod-mates. I will love you just as much as I do now."

"But you will be loving someone else," she sobbed. "And I don't think I could ever love anyone else the way I love you."

"I can no force me," Tuo said, as he drew near.

"You don't have a choice," Sandy argued. "And you wouldn't be forcing yourself on us. Whether we like it or not, we are already connected."

"Why aren't you fighting to stay a man?" Dawn wailed, beating her fists on Sandy. "My man! How can you be so weak?"

"Dawn, stop! It's not his fault," Galina said with some force. "The mermaid milk does its work and doesn't care about accidents. Sandy was turned, whether he likes it or not, and the siren cell has changed his body and his mind. It's not his fault. All of us who have changed sexes have felt the same way."

Dawn burst into body wrenching sobs, as she struggled to apologize for her outburst.

"I be honorable," Tuo said. "I go."

"No!" Sandy argued. "You already did the honorable thing. You stopped Turi. You saved our lives. My change was just an accident, fate. Now I must be honorable, please do not take that away from me by harming yourself."

"To be mermaid, honorable?" Tuo asked, surprised by this rationale.

"To keep your honor is honorable," Sandy said. "You saved our lives, and you are trying to help Shen Chin. I will become one of your mermaids as long as I can remain Dawn's mate: her first mate."

He put his arms around his sobbing wife, and tried to calm her.

"And I will be her second mate," Eve added, sitting on Dawn's other flank, joining in a group hug.

Tuo looked down at the three of them and shook his head. He looked over at MuSu and raised an eyebrow.

"Mermaids carry the pod's future," MuSu said in Mandarin. "Mermen must protect. It is a great burden, but there are many benefits," he finished, waving his hand towards his own mermaids. "If you act with honor, you will be well rewarded."

"Three times well rewarded," Emma added in Mandarin as she lay her head on MuSu's shoulder.

Tuo pulled away from Alexis' breast, feeling his third feeding, counting the bottle from that morning, course through his body. He was already feeling stronger, taller, and he could tell that the combined efforts of Sandi, Dawn, and Eve were beginning to reshape his body, making him taller still, and stronger.

"Alright you have three hours," Alexis said as she watched Sandi, Dawn, and Eve finish their feedings with the triplets. I will be back with Emma and we will go to the lab and radio Shen, right? After that, you can have the last feeding before transition."

"Yes," Tuo answered, feeling the power of the milk course through his body.

The four mermaids waddled back over to the edge of the pool in the nursery cave and disappeared into the water. The nursery cave had a low ceiling but a wide shallow pool. The room was illuminated with the same pale green light that glowed in nearly all the caves in the mercomplex. The nursery cave was so designated because it had a single tunnel connecting back to the Moon Pool, so wayward children could only return to the main area. Tonight, however, it was nursing a different kind of growth.

Tuo watched appreciatively as Sandi rose from the water, her body nearly finished changing. During the first phase of Sandi's transformation, they had to keep rinsing Sandi off as body mass oozed into the water. Now, as per Sandi's wishes, and the combined mental energies of Tuo and the other girls, Sandi was now nearly the exact twin of her former wife. Eve was still tall, five foot eight inches, and her long blond hair and blue eyes sparkled with new youthfulness. Her figure had filled out slightly, and her breasts now sat high and firm on her chest. Sandi had shrunk down to Dawn's height, about five foot two inches tall. Both of them had long blond hair that already reached their butts, and both were built like classic blond bombshells. Dawn's breasts returned to their nearly horizontal DD status when she was in high school, and Sandi's still growing breasts were half that size.

"Tuo, come over hear," Dawn ordered, distracting him from his visual appreciation. "Lie down in the water here."

Tuo walked over to where his pod lay in the shallow pool, stretching his legs next to Sandi's reclining body. Dawn grasped his now very impressive cock, and pointed it at Sandi's face.

"One more time, and you'll be finished," she urged.

Sandi looked at the eight-inch cock that throbbed before her, and then up at the strangely familiar but now transformed face of Tuo. She smiled, recognizing Jason's features in Tuo's subtly altered eyes, hair, and face. While he was still of Asian heritage, Tuo now looked more mixed-race, and he was completely gorgeous.

"So, you still have a thing for Jason, eh?" Sandi teased as she slid Tuo's massive tool into her mouth.

"I do not!" both Eve and Dawn protested in unison.

Everyone stopped and looked at one another; even Tuo was surprised. Sandi pulled Tuo's cock from her lips and rested the crown against the side of her cheek.

"Um, Eve, you too?" she asked, even as she could feel the last stages of her transformation into a woman throb through her body, her breasts growing quickly, her nipples now brushing against Tuo's thigh.

"Well, um ... he was single after you showed up," Eve protested.

"How many times did you sleep with him?" Dawn demanded.

"What makes you think that I slept with him?" Eve asked.

Dawn said nothing but merely pointed at Tuo's large cock. About an inch from her pointing finger was a small birthmark in the shape of a clover, just below where Sandi was now stroking his cock back into her mouth.

"Well ... I ... er ... SO WHAT!" Eve protested. "You slept with him too!" she said accusingly.

"But I wasn't focusing on Tuo's body, you were," Dawn said, trying to hold back her own laughter. "I was focusing on Sandi, remember?"

"O.K., then well, what can I say?" Eve said. "Jason was one of the best lovers I ever had," she shrugged her shoulders. "I almost said something to you back in college. I just couldn't believe that you left him for Sandy."

"What do you mean by that?" Sandi challenged, squeezing the base of Tuo's cock so that he wouldn't cum while she settled this matter.

"I've come to know why since then," she protested. "Dawn has never complained about your abilities or your size."

"That's because size has nothing to do with being a great lover," Dawn said, stroking Sandi's hair. "Sandy was the most giving, gentle, and imaginative lover that I ever had. Skill and imagination are more important than size."

"Well, you're right," Eve agreed. "Besides, Jason was a self-centered jerk. I'm sorry Sandi, I didn't mean to suggest that you were inadequate. You're not upset about Tuo looking a little bit like Jason are you?"

"No," she said as she gave Tuo's cock a good lick. "Jason might have been good looking and well built, but Tuo is even more handsome."

"Ah ... thanks," Tuo said as Sandi returned to his cock for a few more strokes.

Sandi could feel that her body was now complete, finished, and she rose up onto her feet in the shallow water. All four of them gasped as they took in the final product. Dawn stood up next to her, and they were indeed identical twins.

"Are you finished?" she asked.

"Oh, yes," Sandi said. "Now it's my turn to see how good Jason's equipment actually was," she said as she crooked her finger at Tuo, who eagerly rose to his feet as well. "But there will be a big difference."

"What's that?" Eve asked, watching as Tuo towered over Sandi and Dawn.

"While you two have been concentrating on our bodies, I've been concentrating on Tuo's imagination," she said with a sultry smile.

Dawn nearly fainted, finding it hard to breath suddenly. "You didn't," she gasped, her chest rising and falling rapidly.

"Oh, yes, I did," Sandi said, as she jumped up into Tuo's arms, wrapping her legs around his waist, his cock sticking out below her well rounded ass. She pushed her now wet vagina into his belly and her breasts into his broad and muscular chest. "Dawn, my sister-wife, put it into me," she urged as Tuo lowered his hands to her hips and lifted her small but shapely body away from his own.

Dawn reached under Sandi's perfect bubble butt and lifted Tuo's cock up to a forty-five degree angle. Tuo then gently lowered Sandi onto his cock. She started moaning as it pierced her sex for the first time, a low moan that grew in intensity as Tuo slowly, ever so slowly, lowered her down, centimeter by centimeter. Eve and Dawn began stroking the two lovers along their shoulders and sides as Sandi continued her inevitable journey towards womanhood. She squealed briefly when her hymen broke, but Tuo's slow, gentle progress continued without further pain. Finally, he was buried completely within her new womb.

"Oh, gods and goddesses," Sandi moaned. "Tuo's so big ... so good."

"I will spend my life serving you," he said, looking into her eyes as he slowly raised her back up the entire length of his cock.

"That would be the honorable thing to do," Sandi agreed, as Tuo let her weight push her back down onto his cock.

"His English got better quickly," Eve mused.

"I've just turned into a woman, and you're questioning his improved English?" Sandi asked.

"Good point," Eve said, smiling.

"Dawn is your first, but you are my first," Tuo said, holding Sandi's gaze as he lifted her again. He held her at the furthest end of his stroke, only his crown still nestled within her lips, holding her easily, effortlessly. He smiled and then began to lift her up and down, only a few inches, watching her body bob before him.

"Oh, god," Sandi moaned as she felt Tuo's cock slide in and out, only the crown moving past her lips again and again. "See, I told you," she said, glancing at Dawn.

"Yea, that was one of my favorites," Dawn said, her body quaking with passion, watching as Tuo's big cock pushed only partly in and out of Sandi's dripping cleft. "I can't wait."

Everyone watched as Tuo's impressive muscles kept lifting and swirling Sandi's hips over the tip of his cock, never letting it sink in past the crown. The sound of her sex filled the cave, slipping and smacking as her juices flowed over his cock. Sandi was now whimpering constantly.

"Oh, oh, wait, more, more, oh, oh, not yet, oh, oh, NOW!" she shouted, and Tuo slammed her down onto his crotch, filling her completely.

Sandi froze for a moment, her legs clamped around Tuo's waist, her arms clutching his biceps, her neck rigid, her eyes locked onto his. Neither lover moved. Then she exploded into an orgasm that shook her to the core, her limbs flailing, her breath coming in great sobs as she convulsed against Tuo's strong body, again and again for many moments. Finally, she stopped moaning, and began moving up and down on Tuo's still rigid cock again.

"What?" Eve asked surprised. "He didn't come."

"No," Sandi said happily, "I was in charge of his imagination and skill, remember?"

"Oh ... goooodddddddd," Dawn moaned, shuddering through her own small orgasm without ever having touched herself.

Eve stood stunned, watching Sandi slowly build up steam towards her second orgasm, while Tuo's handsome face remained locked on to Sandi's. Dawn held onto Tuo's other arm, her torso still shaking as she moaned in pleasure.

"I really should have had sex with Sandy before he changed," Eve mused.

"Don't ... worry," Sandi gasped as she pounded herself into Tuo. "You ... ah ... will! There ... are thousands of ... ways to ... make ... a ... girl come ... oooohhh ... and ... I ... spent a lifetime ... dedicated ... to discovering ... aaaaahhhhh ... each ... and ... every ... one ... of ... them."

Three hours later, everyone was smiling when Alexis returned.

While Sandi completed her transformation into a woman, Alexis, Emma, and Galina hovered over the same gurney Tumibay once occupied. Pat, Phoebe, and Tiki floated in the pool at the corner of the lab cave.

"Who is this Manalo, again?" Alexis asked in Polynesian, leaning over Turi.

"Drug boss," he said, his body immobilized in the gurney, water surrounding him, nearly covering his face. "Malaki's son."

"Shen Chin?" Alexis asked after she finished translating his answer for Emma.

"Helper lady," Turi said. "Manalo's whore."

"All this is matching up with Tuo's account," Alexis said in English, looking at the notes Emma was taking on the computer. "Sandi was right, Tuo is honest."

"Well, Tiki, what do you think we should do with him?" Pat asked the islander who treaded water next to her in the pool.

"He bring dishonor, much dishonor," Tiki said solemnly. "He be kill."

"No, but perhaps something else," Pat said. "Is everything ready?"

"Everything but your input," Emma said, salamandering over to the edge of the pool, showing Pat a cluster of plastic discs connected to wires that ran back to the gurney in which Turi lay.

Pat and Phoebe rose up from the pool and lay on the floor of the cave on their sides. Emma quickly attached a series of disks along their dorsal ridges and fed the wires into the water as Phoebe and Pat eased back into the water. Galina did the same for Alexis and Emma, and then Emma attached a final set to Galina.

"Tiki, you'll need to leave," Pat warned as Alexis translated as best she could. "We don't want you to get hurt."

"Witness," Tiki said. "He must know judgement."

"Alright, then go over there, but get out of the water and don't be near anything that might conduct electricity," she said.

Tiki hoisted himself out of the water and went to the other long, steel table near the one where Turi's body was now strapped.

"You lied to your family," he said in Polynesian as Alexis translated for the mermaids. "You lied to me, and you lied to yourself. You almost killed Rangi, and me, and you tried to kill an honorable man. These magical creatures should kill you, but they won't. Be glad it is not our elders who decide this punishment."

"Dog," Turi spat at his cousin.

"Well, that's ironic," Alexis said. "Because that's what we have in mind for you. Ready girls?"

"Ready," everyone agreed, and Emma threw some switches at the console before her.

Alexis leaned over the gurney and slid a long thin needle into Turi's thigh.

"I doubt that you will understand much of this, but I'm going to tell you anyway," Alexis said as she slowly depressed the plunger. "I'm injecting you with a distilled version of our mermaid milk, one that we have altered so that it is more viral than our natural milk. Once the siren cells multiply, they will begin changing your body. Actually, they will change your DNA."

Alexis withdrew the needle, and looked down at the terrified man. "Don't worry, you won't die. But you'll never kill another person ever again."

All the mermaids began to hum, focusing their energies on the man in the gurney. Emma focused on the computer screen, focusing her eyes on the DNA sequence that appeared on the screen before her. She wondered, briefly, if this experiment would work, or if Turi would change into something from his own imagination. She banished the thought from her mind, and redoubled her concentration, feeling the plastic sensors along her own dorsal ridge tingle as her mer-organs revved up, sending electromagnetic signals along the wires into the tank in which Turi was bound.

After a few long minutes, Tiki watched as Turi's body began to twitch, and then waves of convulsions swept through his body. As Tiki watched in amazement, Turi's skin turned gray and became very smooth. In the next ten minutes, his legs merged and his arms were absorbed into his torso, only his hands extended from his shoulders. Turi's body lengthened to nearly three meters, and slowly, the outline of a dolphin began to take shape. After twenty minutes, a large female dolphin waited passively on the gurney, and the mermaids relaxed.

"Do you think it worked?" Galina asked.

"Well, she is a dolphin," Emma reported, looking at her computer screen. "But we will have to test to see if any of the other abilities made it through the change."

"What happened?" Tiki asked, shocked at what he had just witnessed. "Magic?"

"No, not magic," Alexis answered. "But close. The same way we change into mermaids, we can change nearly any living creature into something else. Turi is now a female dolphin with significantly enhanced language skills, we hope. She should be instinctually protective of mermaids, and hopefully will become a sort of family dog for us. You know, a watch dog."

"So that when she has calves, she will pass on her genes and there will be enough watch dogs during storms," Emma explained.

Tiki nodded, approving.

"I am ready to do the honorable thing," Tiki said.

"And what is the honorable thing?" asked Alexis.

"I will give my life to you too," he said smiling.

"As a dolphin?" she asked, surprised.

"As whatever is honorable," he answered, his voice only betraying the slightest bit of fear.

"You did great," Alexis said. "You had me fooled."

"I try best," Tiki said, as he put down the microphone to the shortwave radio. "But I no sound like Turi."

"Did good," Tuo disagreed. "Manalo believe you."

"Yea, you did great," Pat said from the pool in the corner of the lab cave. "There is only one way to find out if it worked. We wait."

To be continued?
